AB  - Landscape architectonic compositions that draw on the underlying landscape structure can function as a carrier for changing programmes, cultures, processes, etc. Precisely such an explicitly spatial design is required to foster the inclusive city, one that is not only socially just but also sensitive to the environment while allowing for and evoking diverse social and natural processes. The objective of an ‘inclusive city’ is often related to social issues, which might easily lead to the exclusion of ecological values; the opposite approach may prove equally exclusive. Inclusivity also means creating room for the unexpected. From a design point of view, this requires two underlying attitudes: a willingness to see any design assignment from different perspectives as well as a readiness to create sustainable, flexible and open designs. These two attitudes are inherent to landscape architecture, which traditionally prioritizes the site over the programme, and—because of the long term, time-based condition of the landscape—is forced to think in open-ended designs. In this paper we discuss a selection of graduation projects of the landscape architecture track at the TU Delft in order to illustrate how inclusivity is inherent to a complete understanding of landscape architecture. Four essential perspectives on analysis and design—perception, palimpsest, process and scale continuum—are discussed in order to reveal their capacity to serve as a basis for designing inclusive urban landscapes. © 2021 TU Delft.

AB  - In this work, we have designed, constructed, and evaluated simple, inexpensive open-source data acquisition systems based on various analog-to-digital converter modules (ADS 1115, MCP 3424, LTC 2400, with resolution from 16 to 24-bit) and a miniature Arduino Nano ™ microcontroller. The constructed data acquisition systems provide excellent performance and are comparable to a commercial, 24-bit device. We provide full schematics and corresponding source codes so that analytical chemists can easily construct any of the developed systems without extensive electronic or programming knowledge. The 24-bit LTC 2400 based device provided the best and comparable performance to a commercial, high-end 24-bit sigma to delta converter (ORCA 2800) at a fraction of cost (less than 50 USD compared to 870 USD for the commercial counterpart). The excellent performance was verified using a capillary electrophoresis system with contactless conductivity detection and separation of inorganic ions in clinical skin wipe and tap water samples. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a new method of detection Covid-19 fever symptoms depending on IoT cloud services to solve the higher time delay of checking the crowded clients that enter public or private agencies which can lead to a dangerous field to spread the disease. An automatically checking process is suggested using a practical experiment is developed using (ESP8266 node MCU, ultrasonic (SR-04), RFID (RC522), human body temperature (MAX30205) sensors, and ThingSpeak platform). Where node MCU is open-source hardware used to transmit the received data (human temperature sensor) from the (MAX30205) to the cloud platform (ThingSpeak) then alert the monitoring manager user when the collected data reached a critical value that specified previously and automatically take action to solve this situation. At the same time, the cloud platform will provide a graphical representation of the received data to display it using different monitoring devices such as (computers, mobiles, and others). © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open-source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. In June 2019, Joel Claypool and I met to plan the fourth edition of Arduino Microcontroller Processing for Everyone! Our goal has been to provide an accessible book on the rapidly evolving world of Arduino for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To make the book even more accessible to better serve our readers, we decided to change our approach and provide a series of smaller volumes. Each volume is written to a specific audience. This book, Arduino III: Internet of Things, explores Arduino applications in the fascinating and rapidly evolving world of the Internet of Things. Arduino I: Getting Started provides an introduction to the Arduino concept. Arduino II: Systems, is a detailed treatment of the ATmega328 processor and an introduction to C programming and microcontroller-based systems design. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animal telemetry has been recognized as a core platform for exploring animal species due to future opportunities in terms of its contribution toward marine fisheries and living resources. Herein, biologging systems with pressure sensors are successfully implemented via open-source hardware platforms, followed by immediate application to captive harbor seals (HS). Remotely captured output voltage signals in real-time mode via Bluetooth communication were reproducibly and reliably recorded on the basis of hours using a smartphone built with data capturing software with graphic user interface (GUI). Output voltages, corresponding to typical behaviors on the captive HS, such as stopping (A), rolling (B), flapping (C), and sliding (D), are clearly obtained, and their analytical interpretation on captured electrical signals are fully validated via a comparison study with consecutively captured images for each motion of the HS. Thus, the biologging system with low cost and light weight, which is fully compatible with a conventional smartphone, is expected to potentially contribute toward future anthology of seal animals. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, the passive seismic techniques based on the microtremor measurements have emerged as an alternative to conventional seismic and geotechnical methods used in engineering seismology and earthquake engineering, especially in the local site effect investigations. These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this article intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems. RaspMI is an open-source hardware and software system that is controlled by a graphical user interface developed by using the MonoDevelop cross-platform and C# programming language. This system has many features such as 72 dB dynamic range, 100 Hz sampling frequency, timer recording mode, text and SAC data file format, and latitude, longitude, date and time support with GPS module. RaspMI has subjected to the various tests in terms of the reliability and sensitivity. The obtained results have shown that RaspMI can be used as an alternative instrument for seismic ambient noise measurements. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this research, a full rehabilitation study (retrofit) of an isolated villa in a Mediterranean climate was carried out in order to show how a retrofit of a building with a combination of simple passive and active strategies can improve the sustainability, energy efficiency and the thermal comfort. This is performed thanks to the design of a methodology of using a thermal simulation tool with experimental measurements based on a low-cost open source hardware platform in order to evaluate the energy saving measures and analyse the thermal comfort and energy savings. To accomplish this, a study of the housing needs is performed a priori to later design the different actions in the rehabilitation, using if possible, ecological materials in its development. Basically, walls and ceilings are insulated, three solar air collectors are included to heat the air ventilation and decrease the heating demand, and two pellet stoves are installed. Finally, the refurbished house is modeled and simulated in EnergyPlus and compared with the indoor air temperature and relative humidity measurements, made using an Open-Source Monitoring System (OSMS) developed for this research in Arduino, obtaining results with no significant differences without the need to calibrate the system. The results of thermal comfort, heating and cooling demand and heating energy consumption of the house before and after the renovation are compared providing a decrease in thermal demand of 66% and a decrease in heating energy consumption of 50% in the winter season, where 60% of the energy consumed is contributed from renewable sources. In terms of thermal comfort, the comparison of the PPD and PMV values shows an improvement in the house in heating and cooling season. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study explains the constructs of a purchasing portfolio model (PPM) that defence authorities can use in practice in defence procurement and designs a segmentation model. We identify open PPM design and application questions in the literature and conduct a Delphi study with twenty experts from Swedish defence authorities to design a segmentation model that is fit-for-purpose. The paper addresses the open design and application questions discussed in the literature and satisfies the operational requirements of the Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF). The proposed segmentation model builds on three dimensions: the operational requirements of the SwAF, the market's ability to deliver supplies on time, and limitations in the SwAF operational capability if the market does not deliver supplies on time. To reduce complexity, we propose a two-stage model in which we use one dimension as a precursor to a two-dimensional model. In the latter, we merge sixteen elements into one square along with three other segments which users should treat differently. The paper contributes to extant academic knowledge on PPMs by eliciting practitioners' views on open design and application questions. We develop the proposed segmentation model in cooperation with practitioners and believe that it will be of value in defence procurement practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Air pollution is a serious problem and has caused public health concerns all over the world. Despite the evidence, the preparedness and response of citizens has been limited. This underlines the importance of having sustainable air quality monitoring solutions that foster inclusion and multi-stakeholder partnerships for social-scientific interventions. This study illustrates how AirBox project has emerged in Taiwan, where makers and citizens use the sensors to sense air quality and provide the public with actionable data about their environments. The AirBox project includes elements of technology-innovation and citizen science: (1) Participatory Sensing – Static and mobile air quality sensing, (2) Open Data – Open hardware, software and access to data, (3) Co-creation Citizen Science – Citizen-led campaigns and forums, and (4) Outreach – Knowledge sharing, trust building and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The project uses a wide range of sensors to provide extendable solutions and data at fine spatio-temporal resolution. The results are highlighted using five cases studies that show how integrating social dimensions in an air quality monitoring framework can lead to public awareness, data-driven applications and environmentally sustainable cities. The multi-faceted approach highlights the effects of a bottom-up citizen science approach that considers local culture, practices and problems at grassroots. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread shortages of N95 respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE). An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the "simple silicone mask"(SSM). Methods A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4-18. Results The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. Conclusion Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables. With further evaluation, such devices may be an alternative to disposable respirators during public health emergencies. The respirator described above is an investigational device and requires further evaluation and regulatory requirements before clinical deployment. The authors and affiliates do not endorse the use of this device at present. Copyright: © 2021 Anwari et al.

AB  - Objective: To investigate which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner designs claustrophobic patients prefer. Material/methods: We analyzed questionnaires completed by 160 patients at high risk for claustrophobia directly after a scan in either a short-bore or open panoramic scanner as part of a prospective randomized trial Enders et al (BMC Med Imaging 11:4, 2011). Scanner preferences were judged based on schematic drawings of four scanners. Information on the diagnostic performance of the depicted scanners was provided, too. Results: A majority of patients suggested upright open (59/160, 36.9%) and open panoramic (53/160, 33.1%) before short-bore designs (26/160, 16.3%, for all p < 0.001) for future development. When asked about patients’ preferred scanner choice for an upcoming examination, information about a better diagnostic performance of a short-bore scanner significantly improved its preference rates (from 6/160 to 49/160 or 3.8 to 30.5%, p < 0.001). Patients with a claustrophobic event preferred open designs significantly more often than patients without a claustrophobic event (p = 0.047). Patients scanned in a short-bore scanner in our trial preferred this design significantly more often (p = 0.003). Noise reduction (51/160, 31.9%), more space over the head (44/160, 27.5%), and overall more space (33/160, 20.6%) were the commonest suggested areas of improvement. Conclusion: Patients at high risk for claustrophobia visually prefer open- over short-bore MRI designs for further development. Education about a better diagnostic performance of a visually less-attractive scanner can increase its acceptance. Noise and space were of most concern for claustrophobic patients. This information can guide individual referral of claustrophobic patients to scanners and future scanner development. Key Points: • Patients at high risk for claustrophobia visually favor the further development of open scanners as opposed to short- and closed-bore scanner designs. • Educating claustrophobic patients about a higher diagnostic performance of a short-bore scanner can significantly increase their acceptance of this otherwise visually less-attractive design. • A medical history of earlier claustrophobic events in a given MRI scanner type and focusing on the features “more space” and “noise reduction” can help to guide referral of patients who are at high risk for claustrophobia. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Home anomaly monitoring is crucial for the elderly who live alone. A number of IoT-based home monitoring systems have been available, but most rely on privacy-intrusive cameras. With more and more concerns on privacy and security of human data, anomaly detection based on nonintrusive IoT devices becomes more desirable. Considering the elderly consumers, a low-cost system with good detection accuracy is further critical for the system's acceptability by elderly users. We propose a smart home monitoring system for living-alone senior citizens, relying on carefully designed, low-cost infrared sensor devices, as well as a cloud-based data processing and anomaly detection platform. Our PIR sensor device is effective in continuous monitoring of motion data in a user's apartment, and an open-hardware software platform is devised to support sensors manufactured by various vendors in the IoT system, all for cost reduction purpose. For privacy preservation, we encrypt collected data and store data indices in a blockchain system, to achieve efficient data access control and auditing. For motion anomaly detection, we propose a simple but effective environment adaptation method to work with the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) method. Experiments driven by real-world traces show good reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of our system. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, a trend toward utilizing open access resources for laboratory research has begun. Open-source design strategies for scientific hardware rely upon the use of widely available parts, especially those that can be directly printed using additive manufacturing techniques and electronic components that can be connected to low-cost microcontrollers. Open-source software eliminates the need for expensive commercial licenses and provides the opportunity to design programs for specific needs. In this review, the impact of the “open-source movement” within the field of chemical separations is described, primarily through a comprehensive look at research in this area over the past five years. Topics that are covered include general laboratory equipment, sample preparation techniques, separations-based analysis, detection strategies, electronic system control, and software for data processing. Remaining hurdles and possible opportunities for further adoption of open-source approaches in the context of these separations-related topics are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Robotic observatories are ideal infrastructures that can be remotely accessed by scientists, amateurs, and general public for research and education in Astronomy. Its robotization is a complex process for ensuring autonomy, safety, and coordination among all subsystems. Some observatories, such as Francisco Sanchez’s, are equipped with two types of telescopes: one for the night and one for the day. The night-time telescope must be protected from exposure to sunlight in order to use them in an automated way. For this purpose, this article proposes the design and construction of a smart cover that opens and closes according to the time of day. The mechatronic design covers the electronic, mechanical, and software programming, and it has been devised taking while taking the principles of open design, ease of reproduction, low-cost, and smart behaviour into account. The design has been parameterized, so that it can be adapted to telescopes of any size. The final prototype is lightweight, cost-effective, and can be built while using common 3D printing and PCB milling machines. The complete design is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and all the documentation, schematics, and software are available in public repositories, like Zenodo, GitHub, and Instructables. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the main outcomes of AGILE (acronym for “Adaptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments”), an EU-funded project that recently delivered a modular hardware and software framework conceived to address the fragmented market of embedded, multiservice, adaptive gateways for the Internet of Things (IoT). Please define if appropriate. Its main goal is to provide a low-cost solution capable of supporting proof-of-concept implementations and rapid prototyping methodologies for both consumer and industrial IoT markets. AGILE allows developers to implement and deliver a complete (software and hardware) IoT solution for managing non-IP IoT devices through a multi-service gateway. Moreover, it simplifies the access of startups to the IoT market, not only providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for industries but also allowing end-users to customize and extend it according to their specific requirements. This flexibility is the result of the joint experience of established organizations in the project consortium already promoting the principles of openness, both at the software and hardware levels. We illustrate how the AGILE framework can provide a cost-effective yet solid and highly customizable, technological foundation supporting the configuration, deployment, and assessment of two distinct showcases, namely a quantified self application for individual consumers, and an air pollution monitoring station for industrial settings. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are key research tools in several contemporary applied optics research domains. In this paper, we present the argument that an open platform for interacting with SLMs would dramatically increase their accessibility to researchers. We introduce HoloBlade, an open-hardware implementation of an SLM driver-stack, and provide a detailed exposition of HoloBlade’s architecture, key components, and detailed design. An optical verification rig is constructed to demonstrate that HoloBlade can provide Fourier imaging capability in a 4f system. Finally, we discuss HoloBlade’s future development roadmap and the opportunities that it presents as a research tool for applied optics. © 2021 Optical Society of America

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem aggravated by the overuse of prophylactic antibiotic therapies and lack of real-time biosensing equipment to differentiate viral from bacterial infections at the Point of Care (POC), particularly in rural areas with limited access to clinical laboratory facilities. As recent studies reveal the potential of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and other acute phase biomarkers to achieve early determination of etiology in acute febrile illness, novel biosensing equipment become a plausible approach in preventing the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics. A low-cost experimental platform was engineered to measure CRP concentrations in 50 μL samples of buffer and enriched plasma, using label-free antigenic probes, legacy electrochemical methods and open-source hardware. The prototype presents a portable, cost-effective device for use at the POC with a simplified user interface that can be used wirelessly by healthcare professionals using a mobile phone or laptop. Based on the measured CRP levels, the device suggests if the acute febrile episode is likely to be of bacterial etiology. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - X-ray transmission rate measurement for material thickness determination is a widely used method in industrial applications. It is usually measured using expensive laboratory equipment. This method, which gives information about the material, is also used quite a lot in medical applications. However, laboratory equipment used in this measurement is often costly. Low-cost laboratory equipment for data acquisition with open-source hardware and software is a lifesaver for the low-budget research projects. Although there are many data acquisition hardware and software in the market, most of them are complex and expensive. They contain many extra features other than some specific ones required for transmission rate measurement. In this study, X-ray transmission rate measurement of some chemical compounds was carried out using a low-cost laboratory counter and data acquisition software. The results are shown by experiments and are consistent with the catalogue values of the materials and chemical compounds used. Thus, in this paper a method is proposed for both measuring the thickness of the material with known linear attenuation coefficient and measuring the linear attenuation coefficient for a material with known thickness. © School of Engineering, Taylor's University

AB  - In this work, an omnidirectional sensor that enables identification of the direction of the celestial sphere with maximum solar irradiance is presented. The sensor, based on instantaneous measurements, functions as a position server for dual‐axis solar trackers in photovoltaic plants. The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun’s position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual‐axis solar tracking with a low‐cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective. Researchers are developing biomedical devices with embedded closed-loop algorithms for providing advanced adaptive therapies. As these devices become more capable and algorithms become more complex, tasked with integrating and interpreting multi-channel, multi-modal electrophysiological signals, there is a need for flexible bench-top testing and prototyping. We present a methodology for leveraging off-the-shelf audio equipment to construct a biosignal waveform generator capable of streaming pre-recorded biosignals from a host computer. By re-playing known, well-characterized, but physiologically relevant real-world biosignals into a device under test, researchers can evaluate their systems without the need for expensive in vivo experiments. Approach. An open-source design based on the proposed methodology is described and validated, the NeuroDAC. NeuroDAC allows for 8 independent channels of biosignal playback using a simple, custom designed attenuation and buffering circuit. Applications can communicate with the device over a USB interface using standard audio drivers. On-board analog amplitude adjustment is used to maximize the dynamic range for a given signal and can be independently tuned for each channel. Main results. Low noise component selection yields a no-signal noise floor of just 5.35 ± 0.063. NeuroDAC's frequency response is characterized with a high pass -3 dB rolloff at 0.57 Hz, and is capable of accurately reproducing a wide assortment of biosignals ranging from EMG, EEG, and ECG to extracellularly recorded neural activity. We also present an application example using the device to test embedded algorithms on a closed-loop neural modulation device, the Medtronic RC+S. Significance. By making the design of NeuroDAC open-source we aim to present an accessible tool for rapidly prototyping new biomedical devices and algorithms than can be easily modified based on individual testing needs.

AB  - To meet various requirements for electron transfer (ET) at the substrate/electrolyte interface, mixed redox couples assigned to different functions have been applied. While in all studies the mixed redox species had different redox potentials, such redox systems inherently lose energy by ET between the species. We report interfacial ET kinetics employing mixed-ligand electrolytes based on Co2+/3+ complexes with mixtures of dimethyl- and dinonyl-substituted bipyridyl (bpy) ligands with the same redox potential. The ET rates of the mixed electrolytes decrease with the increasing ratio of the dinonyl-bpy ligand, with substrates adsorbed by molecules without alkyl chains due to a blocking effect. However, when the molecules on substrates have four alkyl chains, the ET rate between the molecules and the electrolytes with increasing ratio of the dinonyl-bpy ligand is enhanced. The substrate-dependent behavior is explained by selective intermolecular interactions. The results open design flexibility for mixed-redox electrolyte systems to control ET at multi-substrate interfaces and provide a novel means to tune ET rates simultaneously for various ET processes in a system without losing energy by the ET. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The field of rehabilitation and assistive devices is being disrupted by innovations in desktop 3D printers and open-source designs. For upper limb prosthetics, those technologies have demonstrated a strong potential to aid those with missing hands. However, there are basic interfacing issues that need to be addressed for long term usage. The functionality, durability, and the price need to be considered especially for those in difficult living conditions. We evaluated the most popular designs of body-powered, 3D printed prosthetic hands. We selected a representative sample and evaluated its suitability for its grasping postures, durability, and cost. The prosthetic hand can perform three grasping postures out of the 33 grasps that a human hand can do. This corresponds to grasping objects similar to a coin, a golf ball, and a credit card. Results showed that the material used in the hand and the cables can withstand a 22 N normal grasping force, which is acceptable based on standards for accessibility design. The cost model showed that a 3D printed hand could be produced for as low as $19. For the benefit of children with congenital missing limbs and for the war-wounded, the results can serve as a baseline study to advance the development of prosthetic hands that are functional yet low-cost. © Copyright © 2021 Cabibihan, Alkhatib, Mudassir, Lambert, Al-Kwifi, Diab and Mahdi.

AB  - Purpose: The usage of open-source hardware (OSH) designs has been put forward as a means to mitigate the shortage of core medical equipment, such as ventilators and of personal protection equipment (PPE) in medical facilities worldwide, resulting from the ever increasing number of individuals affect by COVID-19. This is due to the model allowing for the lowering of costs and widespread distribution of manufacturing. On the other hand, low adherence to its best practices and insufficient development may jeopardize OSH as a viable aid against the pandemic. In this work, we sought to clarify to what extent publicly available designs of ventilator and PPE are developed and abide by OSH standards as measure of the true openness of the solutions. Methods: We searched the Internet and the literature to compile a comprehensive list of ventilators and PPE, while assessing available documentation in order to objectively evaluate key development landmarks (e.g., testing and governmental clearance) and indicators of adherence by OSH standards, as described by the Open Source Hardware Association. Results: Only a few peer-reviewed articles have been found, while a good number of Internet entries of open ventilator and PPE designs were found. Available documentation varied a lot in quantity and quality. Overall, adherence to OSH best practices and level of development were only partially fulfilled. Conclusions: Although this suboptimal performance regarding openness of designs may limit the benefits of the model, data suggests that present open-source efforts are highly beneficial and that they will be able to completely fulfill their mission given more and better OSH is carried out. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

AB  - Research activities in Antarctica face a number of risk factors, such as cold, strong winds, and isolated or dangerous environments. Among them, crevasses, which are deep cracks in glaciers, can cause fatal accidents since they are difficult to locate as they are covered with snow. In this paper, we present the development, design, and deployment of an UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) that can explore ice-sheets and be used in various polar research fields. The developed UGV was customized to remotely detect crevasses and prevent related accidents. In order to adapt to the harsh terrain of Antarctica, the vehicle features ground clearance over 260 mm, four-wheel-drive ability with a 400W high-power motor, as well as passive joints and differential links to allow for four-point contact on rough terrain. The UGV is also designed to run for more than two hours on the Antarctic ice sheet at a speed of 2.5 m/sec. The control unit uses open-source hardware and software for rapid function implementation and ease of future customization. In November 2019, the UGV detected crevasses successfully by towing an IPR (Ice Penetrating Radar) along the 2.6 km section of the Browning Pass around Jang Bogo Station, Antarctica. Further improvement is required for heading angle errors due to magnetic compass malfunctions in Antarctica, and for the vibration and misalignment of the traction device for the towing research equipment. © ICROS 2021.

AB  - Open design (OD) is a promising approach to address global sustainability challenges. At the same time, however, the increased use of OD brings new challenges. To understand the potential of OD in a specific context, we adopted the concept of a residential rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) as a case study. We first identified the critical design features of the RWHS. After that, we analysed the potential for local reproduction of these features at the grassroots level of low-income communities in developing countries. This analysis revealed that varying limitations related to materials, skills, and manufacturing tools may hamper the adoption of OD by local communities when trying to improve their water management. In the light of our findings, we argue that OD processes are likely to face challenges if replicability, substitutability and adaptability are not successfully integrated into the design. We suggest a design-for-frugality mindset and adoption of parametric design processes and design parameters as key strategies to boost OD processes in low-income communities. We also stress the importance of safety and liability aspects in the studied context. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Contribution: While research indicates usefulness of remote laboratories in teaching of digital hardware systems, their main application is to complement stationary classes. This work presents a low-cost, scalable architecture that supports rapid transformation of teaching to a model based solely on remote access mechanisms. Background: Adaptation of online laboratory solutions from the literature to en-masse teaching of digital circuits is time-consuming and expensive. Solutions that permit cheap and rapid conversion of courses to remote environments seem to be of high value, especially when social distancing renders direct teaching impossible. Intended Outcomes: Demonstration of a flexible and cheap architecture that permits rapid transformation of digital circuits laboratories to the remote environment. Validation of system's performance and usefulness on a large group of students. Application Design: Remote digital circuits laboratories from the literature are designed to complement stationary classes. For successful teaching during pandemic, a low-cost, flexible, and efficient solution to online laboratory based on commonly available technologies is required. Findings: The proposed remote laboratory architecture enables rapid conversion of on-site teaching to online model, while supporting in-situ upgrades and functionality enhancements. The presented solution proved to be a convenient substitute for conventional laboratories during pandemic. IEEE

AB  - The fabrication of integrated circuits is an imperfect process. With the ongoing trend of diminishing transistor geometries, we are witnessing a sharp increase in fabrication defects. That is why any integrated circuit typically has some fixtures for testability. Despite that, there are surprisingly few open-source design-for-testability (DFT) tools that can be used for test patterns generation. Almost all of them, cannot be used with HDL designs and cannot perform scan-chain insertion. In this paper, we introduce a new open-source DFT toolchain that operates on synthesized netlists and is capable of test pattern generation and compaction, fault simulation, as well as scan-chain insertion by leveraging existing open-source EDA technologies.

AB  - The courses and disciplines in the exact sciences are based on practical work (PW) which complements the theoretical teaching. Remote Labs are a recent approach used for educating experimental manipulations by using the performance of information and communication technologies. This work aims to propose the design of an IoT system allowing several remote manipulations in analog electronics. This solution is mainly based on the Red Pitaya STEMLab board, in particular for communication and remote control for measurements and data acquisition through different protocols. The low-cost system provides an intelligent selection between the different integrated practical works on a developed board, as well as other ones carried out externally as extensions according to the professor’s needs. The analysis of the integrated manipulations was done taking into account the minimum latency of the remote control as well as its portability to save time, space, and money without loss of quality and quantity. The presented results relate to a PW of analog electronics, a “RC charging and discharging circuit” has been considered for a comparison of this Remote system with the same PW performed by the classical method “hands-on laboratory”. Our purpose in this study is the development of a control system to maximize the available resource as well as to improve self-learning ability in the electronic field. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - It is important for agricultural chemical applicators to follow proper spray procedures to prevent susceptible crops, animals, people, or other living organisms from being injured far downwind. Spraying during stable atmospheric conditions should be avoided to prevent surface-temperature inversion-induced off-target drift of crop protection materials. Previous statistical analysis determined times of high likelihood of stable atmospheric conditions, which are unfavorable for spraying, during the day under clear and cloudy conditions in hot summer months in the Mississippi Delta. Results validated the thresholds of temperature increase in the morning and temperature drop in the afternoon with wind speeds and the transition between stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. With this information, an algorithm was developed to calculate if atmospheric conditions were favorable for spraying based on field temperature and wind speed at any instant. With this algorithm, a web application was built to provide real-time determination of atmospheric stability and hourly online recommendation of whether aerial applications were appropriate for a location and time in the Mississippi Delta. This study further developed another web application specifically for Stoneville, Mississippi, with data measured from weather stations constructed from inexpensive open-source electronics, accessories, and software for more accurate online guidance for site-specific drift management. The web application is adapted for accessing on mobile terminals, such as smartphones and tablets, and provides timely guidance for aerial applicators and producers to avoid spray drift and air quality issues long distances downwind in the area. © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Partially reconfigurable designs on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) bring an opportunity for developers to license third-party intellectual property (IP) cores. There are multiple IP licensing models that can be used by the FPGA IP market. Their focus is mainly on feasibility and security; however, two major challenges have been ignored by almost all of them. First, both academic or industrial tools do not provide a flow to generate IPs in a standalone environment. Second, these tools only offer manual floorplanning of the IPs, which is both time and performance inefficient. In this work, we present a framework, that can be used by multiple parties to generate different parts of a design independently, that are compatible with each other. It also provides automatic floorplanning based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) that considers the distribution of heterogeneous resources in modern FPGAs, with efficient resource utilization as the main objective. The proposed floorplanning is evaluated with benchmarks from the related work. Furthermore, a use case of internal and open-source designs is used for the validation and evaluation of the independent IP generation and the floorplanner. © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In his book Tools for Conviviality (1975), Ivan Illich calls for human self-limitation in technology development. His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called "self-learning", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by "artificial intelligence"can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation. © 2020 Andreas Beinsteiner, published by De Gruyter 2020.

AB  - Air, water, and soil are essential for terrestrial life, but pollution, overexploitation, and climate change jeopardize the availability of these primary resources. Thus, assuring human health and food production requires efficient strategies and technologies for environmental protection. Knowing key parameters such as soil moisture, air, and water quality is essential for smart farming and urban development. The MeteoMex project aims to build simple hardware kits and their integration into current Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. This paper shows the use of low-end Wemos D1 mini boards to connect environmental sensors to the open-source platform ThingsBoard. Two printed circuit boards (PCB) were designed for mounting components. Analog, digital and I2C sensors are supported. The Wemos ESP8266 microchip provides WiFi capability and can be programed with the Arduino IDE. Application examples for the MeteoMex aeria and terra kits demonstrate their functionality for air quality, soil, and climate monitoring. Further, a prototype for monitoring wastewater treatment is shown, which exemplifies the capabilities of the Wemos board for signal processing. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, which enables data mining. The MeteoMex IoT system is highly scalable and of low cost, which makes it suitable for deployment in agriculture 4.0, industries, and public areas.

AB  - To secure various forms of data, a polymorphic variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard (P-AES) has been introduced. In the P-AES, the AES parameters' values will change with every new key. The exact values will be available only to legitimate communicating parties during execution time. To achieve these objectives, the basic AES transformations, SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns, have been made key-dependent in the proposed P-AES. Hence, with every new key, these transformations will operate differently. The receiver can retrieve the operations' details from the encryption key. Consequently, polymorphism has been achieved and interoperability remains intact. P-AES has been implemented seamlessly using the existing AES modules, and the performance was more or less equal to the AES performance (71 and 70 milliseconds to encrypt 500 bytes using the P-AES and the AES respectively). From a security standpoint, the proposed P-AES fully complies with Kerckhoff's principle. This means the cipher has an open design, and the security provided by the P-AES depends only on the secrecy of the encryption key. The cipher resistance to differential and linear attacks has been proved. Moreover, the resulting proposed cipher can operate in 128 different ways, which will significantly reduce the capabilities of any sophisticated attacker. Furthermore, the proposed P-AES's scores of the key avalanche and the plaintext avalanche were 0.496 and 0.504 respectively. Finally, the Statistical Test Suite (STS) recommended by the NIST has been used to ensure the randomness of the cipher output, and the cipher has passed all the STS tests. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: To implement a modular, flexible, open-source hardware configuration for parallel transmission (pTx) experiments on medical implant safety and to demonstrate real-time mitigation strategies for radio frequency (RF) induced implant heating based on sensor measurements. Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficient (Formula presented.) for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domain E-field probes. Results: Repeatability and precision are ~3% for E-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, ~3% for temperature slopes and an ~6% root-mean-square deviation between (Formula presented.) measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces the E-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with ~100 μK resolution and ~14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode. Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing. © 2020 physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt.

AB  - Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is a powerful technique capable of resolving both relative and absolute distances within and between structurally dynamic biomolecules. High instrument costs, and a lack of open-source hardware and acquisition software have limited smFRET’s broad application by non-specialists. Here, we present the smfBox, a cost-effective confocal smFRET platform, providing detailed build instructions, open-source acquisition software, and full validation, thereby democratising smFRET for the wider scientific community. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The FloripaSat-I project consists of an initiative from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in Brazil, to train students to design, test and integrate innovative space systems. The group just developed its first open-source CubeSat, the FloripaSat-I, which aims to empower students to develop space systems through a practical approach, where they have full control of the design and test of a real spacecraft. The project has already gone through all the stages of a CubeSat mission prior to the launching and operation stages. A prototype of the satellite, as well the engineering models 1 and 2 (EM-I and EM-II) were built. The expertise provided by the engineering models allows the development of a functional flight model (FM). This paper presents the validation and qualification tests that pass various FloripaSat-I models, from the engineering model to the flight model. All stages of the project are described, the tests performed in each phase, as well as the lessons learned. Thus, this paper serves as a guidance for other university teams that want to test their own CubeSats, as well as teams that want to use the open-source hardware and software left as heritage by this project. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.

AB  - Although the cure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) will come in the form of pharmaceutical solutions and/or a vaccine, one of the only ways to face it at present is to guarantee the best quality of health for patients, so that they can overcome the disease on their own. Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge. The device meets all medical requirements and is developed with open-source hardware and software. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Affordable and readily available microelectronics are becoming prevalent in teaching laboratories however these useful and economic tools are not used widely in either academia or industry. Herein we report how a metal organic framework (MOF) synthetic route can be optimized using an in situ monitoring apparatus designed in-house on open source hardware for under $100. We demonstrate that the MOF can be produced at atmospheric pressure, an improvement over previous reports, but also with a reduction in reaction time of 93%. This improvement in reaction time was predicted after a single experiment using the monitoring kit showing how efficiencies in the lab can be gained with very little experimental and monetary overhead while minimising the resources used. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - A CE instrument that can be assembled from commercially available components with minimal construction effort is described. Except for the electronic control circuitry no specially made parts are required. It is based on a flexible design of microfluidic, electropneumatic, and electronic sections and different configurations can easily be implemented. Automated injection into the capillary is performed hydrodynamically by the application of a pressure for a controlled length of time. The performance of the device was tested with a contactless conductivity detector by separating different metal ions. In addition, nine metal cations related to the quality of honey were separated in 2.3 min and four honey samples were analysed quantitatively to demonstrate the applicability of the method. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The blade wrap angle of impeller is an important structural parameter in the hydraulic design of open-design vortex pump. In this paper, taking a vortex pump with a cylindrical blade structure as the research object, two kinds of different blade wrap angle of vortex pump impellers are designed. The experiment and numerical simulation research is carried out, and the results of external characteristics and internal flow field are obtained under different flow rate. The results show that when ensuring that other main structural parameters remain unchanged, the efficiency and head of open-design vortex pump increase with the blade wrap angle decreases. In the case of blade wrap angle increasing, the length of rotating reflux back from lateral cavity to inlet is longer. For the same type of vortex pump, the length of rotating reflux to inlet decreases with the increase of flow rate. At the inlet area of impeller front face, there is an area where liquid flows back to the lateral cavity. The volute section shows that after passing through the impeller and lateral cavity, the liquid is discharged to the pump outlet with strong spiral strength. It is found that the blade wrap angle decreases and the shaft power increases, while the pump efficiency increases. The impeller blade wrap angle of vortex pump can be considered to select a smaller value. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - We describe a high resolution laser polarimeter built from commodity optical components. The optical rotation angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between two harmonically modulated polarised laser beams – an ‘object beam’ that passes through the sample under test and a ‘reference beam’ that bypasses the sample. The complete polarimeter may be assembled from low cost off-the-shelf parts for less than £300 (UK Sterling). Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of ±0.0013° and a precision of ±0.0028° – comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter’s ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring. The polarimeter is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, and source code for its firmware included as Supplementary Information. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - New innovations in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) have revolutionized optical imaging, enabling the characterization of biological structures and interactions with unprecedented detail and resolution. However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within ∼15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - While schools struggle financially, capital for purchasing physical learning aids is often cut. To determine if costs could be reduced for learning aids, this study analyzed classroom-based distributed digital manufacturing using 3-D printing of open-source learning aid designs. Learning aid designs are analyzed in detail for their economic viability considering printing and assembly costs with purchased components and compared to equivalent or inferior commercial products available on Amazon. The results show current open-source 3-D printers are capable of manufacturing useful learning aids and that doing so provides high economic savings in the classroom. Overall, the average learning aid would save teachers 86% when fabricating it themselves. The results show that the average design evaluated was downloaded over 1,500 times and the average savings per year per open-source learning aid design was USD 11,822. To date, the 38 learning aid designs evaluated in this study saved over USD 45,000 each and the total of all of them saved the international educational community over USD 1.7 million. It is clear that investing in the development of open-source learning aids for students provides a return on investment (ROI) for investors hoping to improve education, on average, of more than 100%. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the authors consider the problem of exchanging secrete messages in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) without resorting to cryptographic solutions. In particular, they consider a CPS where the networked controller wants to send a secrete message to the plant. They show that such a problem can be solved by exploiting a Wyner wiretap-like encoding scheme taking advantage of the closed-loop operations typical of feedback control systems. Specifically, by resorting to the control concept of one-step reachable sets, they first show that a wiretap-like encoding scheme exists whenever there is an asymmetry in the plant model knowledge available to control system (the defender) and to the eavesdropper. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is confirmed by means of a numerical example. Finally, they conclude the study by presenting open design challenges that can be addressed by the research community to improve, in different directions, the secrete message exchange problem in CPSs. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Drifters that track their position are important tools in studying the hydrodynamic behavior of rivers. Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to "tinkering scientists", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the "tinkering engineer". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise. © Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Importance: United States primary school closures during the 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected millions of children, with little understanding of the potential health outcomes associated with educational disruption. Objective: To estimate the potential years of life lost (YLL) associated with the COVID-19 pandemic conditioned on primary schools being closed or remaining open. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model estimated the association between school closures and reduced educational attainment and the association between reduced educational attainment and life expectancy using publicly available data sources, including data for 2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Social Security Administration, and the US Census Bureau. Direct COVID-19 mortality and potential increases in mortality that might have resulted if school opening led to increased transmission of COVID-19 were also estimated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Years of life lost. Results: A total of 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 years attended public schools that were closed during the 2020 pandemic, losing a median of 54 (interquartile range, 48-62.5) days of instruction. Missed instruction was associated with a mean loss of 0.31 (95% credible interval [CI], 0.10-0.65) years of final educational attainment for boys and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.46) years for girls. Summed across the population, an estimated 5.53 million (95% CI, 1.88-10.80) YLL may be associated with school closures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 88 241 US deaths from COVID-19 through the end of May 2020, with an estimated 1.50 million (95% CI, 1.23-1.85 million) YLL as a result. Had schools remained open, 1.47 million (95% credible interval, 0.45-2.59) additional YLL could have been expected as a result, based on results of studies associating school closure with decreased pandemic spread. Comparing the full distributions of estimated YLL under both "schools open" and "schools closed" conditions, the analysis observed a 98.1% probability that school opening would have been associated with a lower total YLL than school closure. Conclusions and Relevance: In this decision analytical model of years of life potentially lost under differing conditions of school closure, the analysis favored schools remaining open. Future decisions regarding school closures during the pandemic should consider the association between educational disruption and decreased expected lifespan and give greater weight to the potential outcomes of school closure on children's health.

AB  - Precision aquaculture is a new field that allows farmers to have better control over aquaculture processes, facilitating decision-making and improving efficiency. The implementation and evaluation of a low-cost water-quality monitoring system based on open-source hardware, which is easy to rebuild for scientific applications, is reported in this paper. The proposed system measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, taking records and sending information through a wireless protocol (ZigBee) to a graphical user interface which can display information numerically and graphically, as well as simultaneously storing the information in a database. These variables are very important for aquaculture, as they have a direct influence on critical culture parameters such as growth and survival. Although it is a low-cost system, it offers good quality data and demonstrates efficiency for its use in precision aquaculture. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Multispectral imaging (MI) techniques are being used very often to identify different properties of nature in several domains, going from precision agriculture to environmental studies, not to mention quality inspection of pharmaceutical production, art restoration, biochemistry, forensic sciences or geology, just to name some. Different implementations are commercially available from the industry and yet there is quite an interest from the scientific community to spread its use to the majority of society by means of cost effectiveness and ease of use for solutions. These devices make the most sense when combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), going a step further and alleviating repetitive routines which could be strenuous if traditional methods were adopted. In this work, a low cost and modular solution for a multispectral camera is presented, based on the use of a single panchromatic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor combined with a rotating wheel of interchangeable band pass optic filters. The system is compatible with open source hardware permitting one to capture, process, store and/or transmit data if needed. In addition, a calibration and characterization methodology has been developed for the camera, allowing not only for quantifying its performance, but also able to characterize other CMOS sensors in the market in order to select the one that best suits the budget and application. The process was experimentally validated by mounting the camera in a Dji Matrice 600 UAV to uncover vegetation indices in a reduced area of palm trees plantation. Results are presented for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showing a generated colored map with the captured information. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The importance of monitoring the pressures in the water supply system combined with the high cost of implementation and maintenance of devices capable of this, corroborated the objective of this study. Therefore, we seek to develop low-cost equipment to measure water pressure. For this, 15 MPR dataloggers were produced, costing R$ 208.15 each, calibrated with a commercial equipment. The equipment were installed in residences with different consumptions profiles and altitudes in the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso, for 43 days. The results obtained were satisfied, promising, and showed that the equipment is robust and precise with a R² of 0.9986 when compared with the commercial equipment, in addition to being possible to evaluate the city’s supply system and the necessary interventions. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental go de acesso aberto distribuído nos termos de licença Creative Commons.

AB  - Microencapsulation is a widely studied cell therapy and tissue bioengineering technique, since it is capable of creating an immune-privileged site, protecting encapsulated cells from the host immune system. Several polymers have been tested, but sodium alginate is in widespread use for cell encapsulation applications, due to its low toxicity and easy manipulation. Different cell encapsulation methods have been described in the literature using pressure differences or electrostatic changes with high cost commercial devices (about 30,000 US dollars). Herein, a low-cost device (about 100 US dollars) that can be created by commercial syringes or 3D printer devices has been developed. The capsules, whose diameter is around 500 µm and can decrease or increase according to the pressure applied to the system, is able to maintain cells viable and functional. The hydrogel porosity of the capsule indicates that the immune system is not capable of destroying host cells, demonstrating that new studies can be developed for cell therapy at low cost with microencapsulation production. This device may aid pre-clinical and clinical projects in low-and middle-income countries and is lined up with open source equipment devices. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The measurement of RNA abundance derived from massively parallel sequencing experiments is an essential technique. Methods that reduce ribosomal RNA levels are usually required prior to sequencing library construction because ribosomal RNA typically comprises the vast majority of a total RNA sample. For some experiments, ribosomal RNA depletion is favored over poly(A) selection because it offers a more inclusive representation of the transcriptome. However, methods to deplete ribosomal RNA are generally proprietary, complex, inefficient, applicable to only specific species, or compatible with only a narrow range of RNA input levels. Here, we describe Ribo-Pop (ribosomal RNA depletion for popular use), a simple workflow and antisense oligo design strategy that we demonstrate works over a wide input range and can be easily adapted to any organism with a sequenced genome. We provide a computational pipeline for probe selection, a streamlined 20-min protocol, and ready-to-use oligo sequences for several organisms. We anticipate that our simple and generalizable "open source"design strategy would enable virtually any laboratory to pursue full transcriptome sequencing in their organism of interest with minimal time and resource investment. © 2020 Thompson et al.

AB  - Servo systems are feedback control systems characterized by position, speed, and/or acceleration outputs. Nowadays, industrial advances make the electronic stages in these systems obsolete compared to the mechanical elements, which generates a recurring problem in technological, commercial and industrial applications. This article presents a methodology for the development of an open-architecture controller that is based on reconfigurable hardware under the open source concept for servo applications. The most outstanding contribution of this paper is the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for online self tuning with a focus on both high-quality servo control and reduction of vibrations during the positioning of a linear motion system. The proposed techniques have been validated on a real platform and form a novel, effective approach as compared to the conventional tuning methods that employ empirical or analytical solutions and cannot improve their parameter set. The controller was elaborated from the Graphical User Interface to the logical implementation while using free tools. This approach also allows for modification and updates to be made easily, thereby reducing the susceptibility to obsolescence. A comparison of the logical implementation with the manufacturer software was also conducted in order to test the performance of free tools in FPGAs. The Graphical User Interface developed in Python presents features, such as speed profiling, controller auto-tuning, measurement of main parameters, and monitoring of servo system vibrations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, a modular and open micro X-ray Computed Tomography (μXRCT) system is presented, which was set up during the last years at the Institute of Applied Mechanics (CE) of the University of Stuttgart and earlier at the Institute of Computational Engineering of Ruhr-University Bochum. The system is characterized by its intrinsic flexibility resulting from the modular and open design on each level and the opportunity to implement advanced experimental in situ setups. On the one hand, the presented work is intended to support researchers interested in setting up an experimental XRCT system for the microstructural characterization of materials. On the other hand, it aims to support scientists confronted with the decision to set up a system on their own or to buy a commercial scanner. In addition to the presentation of the various hardware components and the applied modular software concept, the technical opportunities of the open and modular hard- A nd software design are demonstrated by implementing a simple and reliable method for the compensation of bad detector pixels to enhance the raw data quality of the projections. A detailed investigation of the performance of the presented system with regard to the achievable spatial resolution is presented. XRCT datasets of three different applications are finally shown and discussed, demonstrating the wide scope of options of the presented system. © 2020 Author(s).

Objective: To evaluate the drug-drug interactions and the tolerability of combined medication between yimitasvir phosphate capsules with sofosbuvir tablets, omeprazole magnesium enteric-coated tablets, and rosuvastatin calcium tablets in healthy volunteers. Methods: A randomized, open, and continuous administration design was used in trial 1 (yimitasvir phosphate capsules with sofosbuvir tablets). 28 subjects were randomly divided into two groups. A non-randomized, open design was used in trial 2 (yimitasvir phosphate capsules with omeprazole magnesium enteric-coated tablets), and included 42 subjects divided into three groups. The open design method was used in trial 3 (yimitasvir phosphate capsules with rosuvastatin calcium tablets), and included 14 subjects. The plasma concentrations of yimitasvir phosphate, sofosbuvir and their main metabolites GS-331007, omeprazole and rosuvastatin were validated by a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by Phoenix winNonlin software. Results: (1) in trial 1, after single and co-administration, the 90% CI of sofosbuvir C(max) and AUC(0-tau) geometric mean ratio (GMR) were 152.0% (118.0% ~ 197.0%) and 230.0% (184.0% ~ 287.0%), with an increase of 52.0% and 130.0% compared to single dose of sofosbuvir, respectively. The 90% CI of GS-331007 C(max) GMR was 74.0% (67.5% ~ 81.2%) and reduced by 26% compared to single dose of sofosbuvir. (2) in trial 2, the 90% CI of C(max) GMR after yimitasvir single or co-administration at the same time, with a 4-hours interval, or with a 12- hours interval were 68.9% (44.5% ~ 106.7%) , 64.0% (43.8% ~ 93.6%) and 56.4%(38.9% ~ 81.9%), and the 90% CI of AUC(0-t) GMR were 68.6% (46.5% ~ 101.2%), 68.3% (47.6% ~ 98.0%) and 60.5% (41.8% ~ 87.5%), respectively. Compared with single dose of yimitasvir, the C(max) and AUC(0-t) were decreased by 31.1% and 31.4%, 36.0% and 31.7%, 43.6% and 39.5%, respectively. (3) In trial 3, after single and co-administration, the 90% CI of rosuvastatin C(max) and AUC(0-72) GMR were 172.4% (153.6% ~ 193.5%) and 158.0% (144.3% ~ 172.9%), respectively, with an increase of 74.9% and 60.5% compared to single dose of rosuvastatin. There were no serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Conclusion: Yimitasvir phosphate capsules have drug-drug interactions with sofosbuvir tablets, omeprazole magnesium enteric-coated tablets, and rosuvastatin calcium tablets.

AB  - Caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) experience higher rates of stress, social isolation, and poor mental and physical health compared to non-caregiving populations. There is a vital need for engaging, sustainable, and scalable resources to support social, physical, and emotional wellbeing amongst caregivers of PWD. To explore this open design space, we designed and conducted a 6-week mixed-method evaluation of Go&Grow, a pervasive social exergame in which flowers grow as users increase physical activity and interact with other caregivers of PWD. Our findings showed that using Go&Grow helped participants relieve stress, increase physical activity, and develop empathy for and patience towards the loved one with dementia that they cared for. At the same time, tension arose as some caregivers desired to learn about the life challenges that Go&Grow users faced, while others hesitated to share such content. We discuss our findings and recommendations for future technology that promotes caregivers? time for themselves, understanding of PWD, and connections with other caregivers. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Relevant to mobile health, the design of a portable electrocardiograph (ECG) device using AD823X microchips as the analog front-end is presented. Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device’s several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Both the free and open source software (FOSS) as well as the distributed digital manufacturing of free and open source hardware (FOSH) has shown particular promise among scientists for developing custom scientific tools. Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm. © 2020

AB  - Recently, the Internet of things(IoT) has received great attention, and the demand for IOT applications in various fields is increasing. But drawbacks of IoT, such as having to use dedicated equipment and having to pay for a flat fee monthly, do not satisfy the consumers' demands. These shortcomings of IoT is causing the appearance of users who try to design the environment of IoT that responds their demands and naturally, attempts to have monitoring system through open-source hardware like Arduino. Open source hardware has attracted a great deal of attention for the diffusion of the Internet of things as a key element of the Internet construction. The emergence of open source hardware, which has the advantage of low cost and easy and fast development, has made it possible to embody the idea of object Internet application services. In this paper, we design and implement a system that controls the objects in real time using open source hardware and MQTT protocol. Copyright © 2020 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - A bottom-illuminated orbital shaker designed for the cultivation of microalgae suspensions is described in this open-source hardware report. The instrument agitates and illuminates microalgae suspensions grown inside flasks. It was optimized for low production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, consistent, and controllable growth light intensity. The illuminated orbital shaker is especially well suited for low-resource research laboratories and education. It is an alternative to commercial instruments for microalgae cultivation. It improves on typical do-it-yourself microalgae growth systems by offering consistent and well characterized illumination light intensity. The illuminated growth area is 20 cm × 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or six 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The photosynthetic photon flux density, is variable in eight steps (26-800μmol·m-2·s-1) and programmable in a 24-h light/dark cycle. The agitation speed is variable (0-210RPM). The overall material cost is around £300, including an entry-level orbital shaker. The build takes two days, requiring electronics and mechanical assembly capabilities. The instrument build is documented in a set of open-source protocols, design files, and source code. The design can be readily modified, scaled, and adapted for other orbital shakers and specific experimental requirements. The instrument function was validated by growing fresh-water microalgae Desmodesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris. The cultivation protocols, microalgae growth curves, and doubling times are included in this report. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Despite advances in measuring fluid viscosity, we still lack portable viscometers to analyze shear rate-varying fluid characteristics in the form of open-source hardware that non-expert users can easily make and use. We present a hand-held, automatic capillary viscometer, termed "Viscopette", which can be fabricated simply by assembling globally available mechanical (a stepper motor and an inline pressure sensor), fluidic (a positive-displacement pipette and a cut tubing piece), electronic (an Arduino board) parts in a 3D-printed housing. The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm × 7.3 cm × 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition. With the advantages of ease-of-use, portability, and shear-rate controllability, we demonstrate the Viscopette's ability to accurately analyze Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Our method addresses the unmet need in portable, high-performance viscometers suitable for use as an open-source equipment, which can facilitate on-site, accurate viscosity analysis even by non-expert users. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The field of Open Source Hardware Mechanical Ventilators (OSH-MVs) has seen a steep rise of contributions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. As predictions showed that the number of patients would exceed current supply of hospital-grade ventilators, a number of formal (academia, the industry and governments) and informal (fablabs and startups) entities raced to develop cheap, easy-to-fabricate mechanical ventilators. The presence of actors with very diverse modus operandi as well as the speed at which the field has grown, led to a fragmented design space characterized by a lack of clear design patterns, projects not meeting the minimum functional requirements or showing little-to-no innovation; but also valid alternatives to hospital-grade devices. In this paper we provide a taxonomic system to help researchers with no background in biomedical engineering to read, understand and contribute to the OSH-MV field. The taxonomy is composed of ten properties that are read through the lenses of three reflection criteria: buildability, adoptability and scalability. We applied the taxonomy to the analysis of seventeen OSH-MV projects, which are representative of the current landscape of possibilities available for COVID-19 patients. We discuss the different design choices adopted by each project highlighting strengths and weaknesses and we suggest possible directions for the development of the OSH-MV field. © 2020

AB  - Light sensors can provide valuable information about environmental exposure; however, current light sensing packages are limited. This work presents the development of an open-source hardware device capable of logging light measurements. Due to its lightweight, wearable construction, it is well-suited to human subject research in naturalistic conditions. Its low cost makes it a viable option for population studies. This work offers an example application of objectively determining whether a person is indoors or outdoors based on the light measurements. This application has practical value within disciplines such as environmental and health psychology, which seek to relate psychological outcomes to environmental exposure. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Automation liberates scientific staff from repetitive tasks, decreases the probability of human error and consequently enhances the reproducibility of lab experiments. However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules – each with a specific set of functionalities – to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, this concept will allow academic groups to improve replicability and reproducibility in cell culture process operations towards more economical and innovative research in the future. © 2020

AB  - With the increasing interest in high throughput screening and parallel assays, laboratories around the world inevitably find themselves in need of driving a multitude of fluid lines to facilitate their large scale studies. The comparatively low cost and no-fluid-contact design of peristaltic pumps make them the go-to systems for such ventures, but using commercially available pumping systems this still becomes a costly endeavor at typically $250-$1000 per pump line. Here we have developed an alternative, a peristaltic pump that can be fabricated in most research laboratories using 3D-printing and readily available off-the-shelf parts. The pump features 8 parallel channels with linear ranges spanning from 0.7 µL/min to 6 mL/min. The pump can be fabricated and assembled by anyone with access to a 3D-printer at a cost of less than $45 per channel and is driven by a stepper motor that connects directly to any computer. This device has the potential to be disruptive in areas such as drug screening and assay development, as well as lab-on-a-chip applications and cell cultivation, where it significantly reduces hardware expenses and allows for construction of more comprehensive fluidic systems at a fraction of current costs. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Commercial modules for learning advanced control systems are not quite common and some are very expensive due to their sensors, electronic and license. There is an open area to develop and to build didactic modules to improve the learning process using experimentation in real physical systems. Particularly, a cart inverted pendulum is a classical physical system very commonly used in recent decades. We propose a cart inverted pendulum named MoDiCA-X as a low-cost didactic module with open source hardware and software. It is an electromechanical system feasible to build and easy to be modified. The mechanical parts of the module are 3D printed solids and can also be easily replicated. In terms of programming, the control applied to the system can be modified, since it uses C/C++ programming languages that are widely used in the academic community. The module is equipped with two very commercial sensors, are easy to install and to remove; both acquire the pendulum attitude and the car position. The actuators are four electric DC motors coupled to the car wheels to provide suitable velocity and torque to each axle independently. We validate the performance of the module by applying a multivariable linear quadratic regulator algorithm (LQR). © 2020

AB  - Access to nasopharyngeal swabs for sampling remain a bottleneck in some regions for COVID-19 testing. This study develops a distributed manufacturing solution using only an open source manufacturing tool chain consisting of two types of open source 3-D printing and batch UV curing, and provides a parametric fully free design of a nasopharyngeal swab. The swab was designed using parametric OpenSCAD in two components (a head with engineered break point and various handles), which has several advantages: i) minimizing print time on relatively slow SLA printers, ii) enabling the use of smaller print volume open source SLA printers, iii) reducing the amount of relatively expensive UV resin, and iv) enabling production of handle on more accessible material extrusion 3-D printers. A modular open source UV LED box was designed, fabricated for $45 and tested for batch curing. Swabs can be fabricated for $0.06-$0.12/swab. The results of the mechanical validation tests showed that the swabs could withstand greater forces than would be expected in normal clinical use. The swabs were also able to absorb a significant amounts of synthetic mucus materials and passed abrasion and handling tests. The results show the open source swab are promising candidates for clinical trials. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Hydrocarbon contamination plagues high-resolution and analytical electron microscopy by depositing carbonaceous layers onto surfaces during electron irradiation, which can render carefully prepared specimens useless. Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10-10 hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.

AB  - Implementations of light-sheet microscopes are often incompatible with standard methods of sample mounting. Light-sheet microscopy uses orthogonal illumination and detection to create a thin sheet of light which does not illuminate the sample outside of the depth of field of the detection axis. Typically, this configuration involves a pair of orthogonal objectives which constrains the positioning and length of cover slips in the range of the detection objective. Here, we present an open-hardware sample mounting system for light-sheet microscopes using large detection objectives, built using 3D printed components and demonstrate the chamber's efficacy on live biological samples in a custom light-sheet microscope. Lay Description: Implementations of light-sheet microscopes are often incompatible with standard methods of sample mounting. Light-sheet microscopy creates a thin sheet of light at a certain depth of field within a volumetric sample. Typically, this configuration involves a pair of orthogonal objectives which constrains the positioning of samples and sample-mounting apparatus in range of the detection objective. To overcome the limitations of this setup, we present an open-hardware sample mounting system for light-sheet microscopes using large detection objectives, built using 3D printed components and demonstrate the chamber’s efficacy on live biological samples in a custom light-sheet microscope. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - DNA electrophoresis is a fundamental technique in molecular biology that allows the separation of DNA molecules up to ~50 Kbp. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] is a variation of the conventional DNA electrophoresis technique that allows the separation of very large DNA molecules up to ~10 Mbp. PFGE equipment is very expensive and it becomes an access barrier to many laboratories. Also, just a few privative designs of the equipment are available and it becomes difficult for the community to improve or customize their functioning. Here, we provide an open source PFGE equipment capable of the separation of DNA molecules up to, at least, ~2 Mbp and at low cost: USD$850, about 3% of the price of typical commercial equipment. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Two-photon (2P) microscopy is a cornerstone technique in neuroscience research. However, combining 2P imaging with spectrally arbitrary light stimulation can be challenging due to crosstalk between stimulation light and fluorescence detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple and low-cost electronic solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller and a TLC5947 LED driver to rapidly time-interleave stimulation and detection epochs during scans. Implemented for less than $100, our design can independently drive up to 24 arbitrary spectrum LEDs to meet user requirements. We demonstrate the utility of our stimulator for colour vision experiments on the in vivo tetrachromatic zebrafish retina and for optogenetic circuit mapping in Drosophila. © 2020

AB  - Low-cost high-resolution metal 3-D printing remains elusive for the scientific community. Low-cost gas metal arc wire (GMAW)-based 3-D printing enables wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for near net shape applications, but has limited resolution due to the complexities of the arcing process. To begin to monitor and thus control these complexities, the initial designs of the open source GMAW 3-D printer have evolved to include current and voltage monitoring. Building on this prior work, in this study, the design, fabrication and use of the open source arc analyzer is described. The arc analyzer is a multi-sensor monitoring system for quantifying the processing during WAAM, which includes voltage, current, sound, light intensity, radio frequency, and temperature data outputs. The open source arc analyzer is tested here on aluminum WAAM by varying wire feed rate and measuring the resultant changes in the sensor data. Visual inspection and microstructural analysis of the printed samples looking for the presence of porosity are used as the physical indicators of quality. The value of the sensors was assessed and the most impactful sensors were found to be the light and radio frequency sensors, which showed arc extinction events and a characteristic “good weld” peak frequency. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - A major frontier in neuroscience is to find neural correlates of perception, learning, decision making, and a variety of other types of behavior. In the last decades, modern devices allow simultaneous recordings of different operant responses and the electrical activity of large neuronal populations. However, the commercially available instruments for studying operant conditioning are expensive, and the design of low-cost chambers has emerged as an appealing alternative to resource-limited laboratories engaged in animal behavior. In this article, we provide a full description of a platform that records the operant behavior and synchronizes it with the electrophysiological activity. The programming of this platform is open source, flexible, and adaptable to a wide range of operant conditioning tasks. We also show results of operant conditioning experiments with freely moving rats with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings. © 2020

AB  - Design for additive manufacturing is adopted to help solve problems inherent to attaching active personal sampler systems to workers for monitoring their breathing zone. A novel and parametric 3D printable clip system was designed with an open source Computer-aided design (CAD) system and was additively manufactured. The concept was first tested with a simple clip design, and when it was found to be functional, the ability of the innovative and open source design to be extended to other applications was demonstrated by designing another tooling system. The clip system was tested for mechanical stress test to establish a minimum lifetime of 5000 openings, a cleaning test, and a supply chain test. The designs were also tested three times in field conditions. The design cost and functionalities of the clip system were compared to commercial systems. This study presents an innovative custom-designed clip system that can aid in attaching different tools for personal exposure measurement to a worker's harness without hindering the operation of the worker. The customizable clip system opens new possibilities for occupational health professionals since the basic design can be altered to hold different kinds of samplers and tools. The solution is shared using an open source methodology. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - To assist firefighters and other first responders to use their existing equipment for respiration during the COVID-19 pandemic without using single-use, low-supply, masks, this study outlines an open source kit to convert a 3M-manufactured Scott Safety self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) into a powered air-purifying particulate respirator (PAPR). The open source PAPR can be fabricated with a low-cost 3-D printer and widely available components for less than $150, replacing commercial conversion kits saving 85% or full-fledged proprietary PAPRs saving over 90%. The parametric designs allow for adaptation to other core components and can be custom fit specifically to fire-fighter equipment, including their suspenders. The open source PAPR has controllable air flow and its design enables breathing even if the fan is disconnected or if the battery dies. The open source PAPR was tested for air flow as a function of battery life and was found to meet NIOSH air flow requirements for 4 h, which is 300% over expected regular use. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The use of electrical resistivity tomography in laboratory or field experiments for environmental purposes has been increasing in recent years. The development of commercial devices has thus far focused on the quality of measurements and their robustness in all field cases. However, both their costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to specific applications have limited their prevalence in the environmental sector. This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O. Measurements were then carried out on a small field experiment, in demonstrating good stability of the OhmPi measurements, as well as a strong correlation with the output of a commercial reference instrument. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Thermal sterilization is generally avoided for 3-D printed components because of the relatively low deformation temperatures for common thermoplastics used for material extrusion-based additive manufacturing. 3-D printing materials required for high-temperature heat sterilizable components for COVID-19 and other applications demands 3-D printers with heated beds, hot ends that can reach higher temperatures than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hot ends and heated chambers to avoid part warping and delamination. There are several high temperature printers on the market, but their high costs make them inaccessible for full home-based distributed manufacturing required during pandemic lockdowns. To allow for all these requirements to be met for under $1000, the Cerberus – an open source three-headed self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) was designed and tested with the following capabilities: i) 200 °C-capable heated bed, ii) 500 °C-capable hot end, iii) isolated heated chamber with 1 kW space heater core and iv) mains voltage chamber and bed heating for rapid start. The Cereberus successfully prints polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) and polyetherimide (PEI, ULTEM) with tensile strengths of 77.5 and 80.5 MPa, respectively. As a case study, open source face masks were 3-D printed in PEKK and shown not to warp upon widely home-accessible oven-based sterilization. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Taiwan is an aging society, but the appropriate designs must be considered in senior care spaces. Universal design knowledge has been addressed in universities, but students cannot imagine how age affects the needs of senior citizens physically and psychologically. The teaching practice in this study adopted a dyadic teaching method whereby students observed the needs of individuals in a nursing care center for elderly people. It also used cooperative learning methods for nursing students to discuss the needs of senior citizens and to help design students understand the lifestyles of senior citizens through the use of simulation devices. Through the feedback from the learning process, statistical analysis was used to assess the learning performance of students. The design studio used these two teaching methods, and the respective work was entered into an open design competition to verify whether teaching performance was successful. Approximately 70% of the works earned design awards. This provided a preliminary validation of the success of the respective teaching practice method. © 2020, IGI Global.

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Automated water sampling can be very useful, but open-source choices are limited. Here I present an autosampler which consists of a gantry robot that delivers water from a syringe pump to 24 capped 40 ml vials. The autosampler is controlled using an Android tablet automatized using Macrodroid. Three rinsing cycles ensure negligible carryover between consecutive samples. Hourly sampling from a creek under rainy conditions suggested that total organic carbon in water was diluted by the rain. Some important limitations: 1) the autosampler must be on a steady, flat, horizontal surface; 2) unattended sampling can only last as long as the batteries powering the tablet and the motors; 3) distance from the syringe pump to water cannot exceed ~2 m in height and ~4 m in length for 3 mm tubing; 4) sampling frequency does not exceed one sample every eleven minutes. However, because of its open design, the autosampler can be modified and improved to not only overcome these limitations, but also potentially expand its scope to more demanding sampling if necessary. © 2020

AB  - Background: Root-retained overdentures (OD) are one treatment option for partially edentulous patients. However, the available evidence regarding factors influencing abutment survival in root-retained ODs is limited. Purpose: This retrospective study included clinical examinations and evaluated the survival rate of roots restored with precision attachments soldered to post-and-core (gold cap) retained ODs, analysed with respect to various patient- and prosthesis-related factors. Methods: Patients receiving at least one OD with gold caps in the past were invited for comprehensive clinical examinations. The primary outcome parameter was the abutment survival rate over the observation period (2002-2016). Possible contributing factors (eg closed vs open OD design) were analysed. Analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimators, Cox regressions and hazard ratios (HR). Results: 114 patients with 128 ODs originally retained by 280 abutments, with a cumulative total exposure time of 2035.4 years, were examined. Twenty-seven abutment teeth (9.6%) were lost after a mean observation period of 7.9 ± 3.4 years. Significant factors associated with abutment loss were a closed, compared to an open OD design (HR 8.38 (95% CI 1.11-63.59), P =.040), which was independent of the number of abutments per OD. Furthermore, the loss rate was higher when the denture was not worn day-and-night (HR 3.52 (95% CI 1.32-9.40), P =.012). Oral hygiene behaviour was associated with higher HRs. Conclusions: ODs remain a viable treatment option for patients with few teeth remaining in the dental arch. It is advisable to choose an open design for the OD, irrespective of the number of abutment teeth. Furthermore, gold cap-retained ODs should not be removed overnight. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The commercial data acquisition instruments designed for three-component microtremor measurements are usually very expensive devices. In this paper, a low-cost, computer-Aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontalto-vertical spectral ratio (H = V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H=V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analogto-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

AB  - Current frugal design practice is focused on the cost reduction of the product. Despite advancements in the domain of frugal Innovation, it is not systematized to develop products for all sets of users, including marginalized society. Many design researchers and engineers now dedicate time and knowledge to producing practical solutions to enhance the quality of life of the marginal community. The approach currently being adopted restricts the development of products intended for all segments of the users. In this paper, cumulative frequency distribution analysis and the Relative Importance Index is used to identify the essential attributes, which contribute to delivering actual frugal products in terms of functionality, usability, performance, affordability, accessibility, aesthetics, and robustness. The framework is beneficial to eradicate the discriminatory effect of being labeled as “Jugaad” users. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Some of the most promising distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) technical systems use fused particle fabrication (FPF) or fused granular fabrication (FGF), where compression screws force post-consumer waste plastic through a heated nozzle for direct 3D printing. To assist the technical evolution of these systems, this study provided the details of an invention for a low-cost, easily replicable open-source grinding machine for compression screw manufacturing. The system itself can be largely fabricated using FPF/FGF following the self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) methodology. This grinding machine can be made from a cordless cut-off grinder and < $155 in parts. The new invention is demonstrated to be able to cut custom screws with variable (i) channel depths, (ii) screw diameters, (iii) screw lengths, (iv) pitches, (v) abrasive disk thicknesses, (vi) handedness of the screws, (vii) and materials (three types of steel tested: 1045 steel, 1144 steel, and 416 stainless steel). The results show that the device is more than capable of replicating commercial screws as well as providing makers with a much greater flexibility to make custom screws. This invention enables the DRAM toolchain to become even more self-sufficient, which assists the goals of the circular economy. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) is an important, rapidly emerging, manufacturing technology that takes the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) and builds parts in a layer-by-layer style. Thus, since the development of 3D printing, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most promising and inexpensive techniques for shaping free-form parts. It used a thermoplastic filament as a starting material to extrude, layer by layer, the suitable 3D object. It is assisted by a large community of developers, searchers, and users and with multiple free hardware and software open sources expanding the scope of its applications. However, in this process, printing objects with multi-materials and multicolors becomes a major challenge for most extrusion system of printing platforms. For example, in case it is required to print multi-material and multicolored parts, a high-quality head extruder should be used. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of proposing a new extruder system of printing parts with multicolors and materials. For this purpose, in the present paper, the different extrusion systems capable of printing parts with multicolors and materials were presented. The operating principle of each extrusion system is well explained through functional diagrams. Then, its advantages and disadvantages are cited. Finally, some prospects for improving these systems are presented and that will be the work of the next paper. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In vivo electrophysiology experiments require the collection of data from multiple subjects, often for extended periods. Studying multiple subjects for extended periods can be made more efficient through simultaneous recordings, but scaling up recordings to accommodate larger numbers of subjects simultaneously requires coordination and consideration of costs and flexibility. To facilitate this process, we have developed OpBox, an open source set of tools to acquire electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) flexibly from multiple rodent subjects simultaneously. OpBox combines open source hardware and software with off-the-shelf components to create a system that costs less than commercial solutions ($500 per subject), and can be easily deployed for multiple subjects. Coded in MATLAB, OpBox scripts can simultaneously and flexibly collect and display multiple analog and digital data streams, for instance real-time EEG and EMG, event triggers from a behavioral system, and rotary encoder data. OpBox also calculates and displays real-time spectral representations and event-related potentials (ERPs). To verify the performance of our system, we compare our amplifiers with two other commercial amplifiers, a Grass P55 AC preamplifier and an Intan RHD2000-series amplifier. The OpBox amplifier performs comparably to commercial amplifiers for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), noise floors, and common mode rejection. We also demonstrate that our acquisition system can reliably record multichannel data from multiple subjects, and has been successfully tested with 12 subjects running simultaneously on a single standard desktop computer. Together, OpBox increases the flexibility and lowers the cost for simultaneous acquisition of electrophysiology data from multiple subjects. Copyright © 2020 Kimchi et al.

AB  - Zooplankton play vital ecological roles that maintain aquatic ecosystems. Imaging instruments have enabled in situ observations of these organisms that can be automated and are less invasive than traditional sampling methods. However, these instruments are often costly and require sophisticated engineering expertise to operate. The In situ Plankton Assemblage eXplorer (IPAX) is an open-source low-cost imaging platform for zooplankton studies. The IPAX is a programmable instrument that has powerful LED illumination and a high-resolution camera that can image zooplankton in situ, while material costs are less than USD $450. The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 µm features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm × 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs. The IPAX enables economical and autonomous surveys of zooplankton in various aquatic habitats. Its low cost facilitates construction and deployment of multiple units that can cover large spatial areas, while its versatility also allows adaptations to many experimental needs for aquatic ecology. © 2020 The Author.

AB  - In recent years, substantial resources have been invested in researching and describing the enactment of “core practices” of teaching in teacher education. This review of the literature examined more than 40 articles published between 2008 and August 2018 in an effort to determine how teacher educators are supporting teacher candidates to learn about and enact core practices of teaching. The review of the literature presented here demonstrates two distinct approaches that teacher educators use to introduce and prepare teacher candidates to enact core practices: a predesigned enactment approach and an open-design enactment approach. Our goal in identifying these two approaches is to illuminate the role and actions of teacher educators in core-practice work and to demonstrate that the decisions teacher educators make in core-practice work are complex and nuanced, and require further description than heretofore available. © 2019 American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.

AB  - Recently, the zebrafish has gained in popularity as a vertebrate animal model for biomedical research. Commercial zebrafish housing systems are available and are designed to maximize stocking density of fish for a given space, but these systems are expensive and purchasing them may not be feasible for emerging laboratories with limited funding. In this article, we describe the construction of a simple and affordable recirculating zebrafish housing system. This system can be constructed in 3 working days, with materials readily available in hardware stores. The cost for construction of the system was only 3,000 MYR (750 USD). The system consists of a water reservoir, a supply line that delivers water to the shelves holding the zebrafish tanks, and a drainage line that receives water from both the supply line and the shelves containing the fish tanks and returns this water to the reservoir. This system also has a 3-stage filtration process to ensure that clean water is delivered to the zebrafish tank. The system can house up to 360 zebrafish. This low-cost housing system may make research using zebrafish feasible some laboratories.

AB  - Objective: Evaluate the clinical utility of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for informing medication selection among older adults who have experienced antidepressant medication failure for major depressive disorder (MDD). Design: Post hoc analysis of data from a blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing two active treatment arms. Setting: Psychiatry specialty and primary care clinics across 60 U.S. community and academic sites. Participants: Adults age 65 years or older at baseline (n = 206), diagnosed with MDD and inadequate response to at least one medication on the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test report during the current depressive episode. Intervention: Combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing to inform medication selection (guided-care), compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Outcomes: Mean percent symptom improvement, response rate, and remission rateat week 8, measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; medication switching; and comorbidity moderator analysis. Results: At week 8, symptom improvement was not significantly different for guided-care than for TAU (∆ = 8.1%, t = 1.64, df = 187; p = 0.102); however, guided-care showed significantly improved response (∆ = 13.6%, t = 2.16, df = 187; p = 0.032) and remission (∆ = 12.7%, t = 2.49, df = 189; p = 0.014) relative to TAU. By week 8, more than twice as many patients in guided-care than in TAU were on medications predicted to have no gene-drug interactions (χ2 = 19.3, df = 2; p &lt;0.001). Outcomes in the guided-care arm showed consistent improvement through the end of the open-design 24-week trial, indicating durability of the effect. Differences in outcomes between arms were not significantly impacted by comorbidities. Conclusions: Combinatorial pharmacogenomic test-informed medication selection improved outcomes over TAU among older adults with depression. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - We report a simple, non-invasive sensor for monitoring flow-rate and flow-uniformity in absorbing and non-absorbing (colourless) segmented flows, using time-resolved measurements of optical transmission. The self-contained sensor is simple in design, inexpensive, and easy to assemble, comprising just two light-emitting diodes, two photodiodes, a 3D-printed housing and a low-cost microcontroller development board. All calculations are carried out directly on the microcontroller, using a computationally efficient algorithm based on the sliding discrete Fourier transform. The sensor is released as open hardware, with design files, source code and assembly instructions included in the Supporting Information. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The separation of suspensions and immiscible liquids by the laboratory centrifuge is widely used in such fields as chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and clinical medicine. In this paper, an Arduino-based microcentrifuge was fabricated using a computer DVD (digital versatile disc) drive. The hardware part consisted of inexpensive mechanical and electronic parts such as the recycled parts of a computer DVD drive, an Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver, a magnetic sensor (for speed measurement), and a display. The microcentrifuge provided a wide speed range of 1,000-10,000 rpm. The fabrication process is easy, and the total fabrication cost of the fabricated microcentrifuge is less than $25. Since the fabricated microcentrifuge has open-source hardware and software parts, it is appropriate for educational purposes and laboratory settings.

AB  - The development of sharing economy and social media technology leads to a new design mode-community-based product design (CPD), including crowdsourcing design, open source design, and maker product design. CPD projects have the potential to use socialized design resource for creative product development because they are openly participated by a large number of socialized designers. However, CPD projects are unreliable, unpredictable, and usually endure low success rate. We believe that the reason for these problems is that many unreliable factors caused by the nature of CPD mode are disturbing the implementation of CPD projects, but few research works can provide systematic and quantitative understanding of the relationship between these factors and CPD project feasibility, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate and manage their CPD projects. To mitigate these problems, in this paper an improved Bayesian causal map approach is developed and used to build a CPD project feasibility analysis model. The model can reveal the interaction relationship among the factors, and provide quantitative evaluation of CPD project feasibility given the states of the factors. In this way, the model can help the stakeholders in CPD project management by showing them which factors require priority processing and providing them with the prediction of project success rate, and eventually improve the overall reliability of CPD projects. The model has been verified through sensitivity analysis and post analysis on real CPD projects. © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - OpenSWAP is a class of innovative open architecture, low cost autonomous vehicles for geological/geophysical studies of shallow water environments. Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Optical projection tomography (OPT) is a 3D imaging alternative to conventional microscopy which allows imaging of millimeter-sized object with isotropic micrometer resolution. The zebrafish is an established model organism and an important tool used in genetic and chemical screening. The size and optical transparency of the embryo and larva makes them well suited for imaging using OPT. Here, we present an open-source implementation of an OPT platform, built around a customized sample stage, 3D-printed parts and open source algorithms optimized for the system. We developed a versatile automated workflow including a two-step image processing approach for correcting the center of rotation and generating accurate 3D reconstructions. Our results demonstrate high-quality 3D reconstruction using synthetic data as well as real data of live and fixed zebrafish. The presented 3D-printable OPT platform represents a fully open design, low-cost and rapid loading and unloading of samples. Our system offers the opportunity for researchers with different backgrounds to setup and run OPT for large scale experiments, particularly in studies using zebrafish larvae as their key model organism. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB  - How the brain fluidly orchestrates visual behavior is a central question in cognitive neuroscience. Researchers studying neural responses in humans and nonhuman primates have mapped out visual response profiles and cognitive modulation in a large number of brain areas, most often using pared down stimuli and highly controlled behavioral paradigms. The historical emphasis on reductionism has placed most studies at one pole of an inherent trade-off between strictly controlled experimental variables and open designs that monitor the brain during its natural modes of operation. This bias toward simplified experiments has strongly shaped the field of visual neuroscience, with little guarantee that the principles and concepts established within that framework will apply more generally. In recent years, a growing number of studies have begun to relax strict experimental control with the aim of understanding how the brain responds under more naturalistic conditions. In this article, we survey research that has explicitly embraced the complexity and rhythm of natural vision. We focus on those studies most pertinent to understanding high-level visual specializations in brains of humans and nonhuman primates. We conclude that representationalist concepts borne from conventional visual experiments fall short in their ability to capture the real-life visual operations undertaken by the brain. More naturalistic approaches, though fraught with experimental and analytic challenges, provide fertile ground for neuroscientists seeking new inroads to investigate how the brain supports core aspects of our daily visual experience. © 2020

AB  - This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open-source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. In June 2019, Joel Claypool and I met to plan the fourth edition of Arduino Microcontroller Processing for Everyone! Our goal has been to provide an accessible book on the rapidly evolving world of Arduino for a wide variety of audiences including students of the ?ne arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To make the book even more accessible to better serve our readers, we decided to change our approach and provide a series of smaller volumes. Each volume is written to a speci?c audience. This book, Arduino II: Systems, is a detailed treatment of the ATmega328 processor and an introduction to C programming and microcontroller-based systems design. Arduino I: Getting Started provides an introduction to the Arduino concept. Arduino III: the Internet of Things explores Arduino applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). © 2020 by Morgan & Claypool All rights reserved.

AB  - Overview: In this article we frame the concept of a hardware-rich open source ecosystem (H-ROSE) that generates software and hardware components. In an H-ROSE, the designs of some components are accessible under open source licenses, while other component designs remain proprietary. We describe seven adoption factors used by the multinational French firm Thales to assess the efficacy of RISC-V to design processors. Other companies can use these adoption factors to explore whether an open hardware initiative supported by an H-ROSE is worthwhile. © 2020, Copyright © 2020, Innovation Research Interchange.

AB  - RTL simulation is a critical tool for hardware design but its current slow speed often bottlenecks the whole design process. Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers. © 1981-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this work, we develop open source hardware and software for eye state classification and integrate it with a protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). We design and build the hardware using a reduced number of components and with a very low-cost. Moreover, we propose a method for the detection of open eyes (oE) and closed eyes (cE) states based on computing a power ratio between different frequency bands of the acquired signal. We compare several real- and complex-valued transformations combined with two decision strategies: a threshold-based method and a linear discriminant analysis. Simulation results show both classifier accuracies and their corresponding system delays. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, Internet-based devices have evolved into platforms for new networks, with Internet of Things technology being applied in various areas. The expansion of scope of this technology and exchange of real-time information enables users to check their content whenever. The real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform has been developed to detect and monitor users in installed spaces. In this article, the real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform utilizes a non-contact sensor module and motion recovery printed circuit board module to quickly respond to emergency situations through real-time monitoring. This is visualized on the display by sending data extracted from the motion recovery printed circuit board module combined with open source hardware by the non-contact sensor module receiving information from smartphone users. The administrator’s display continuously analyzes real-time moving objects by detecting them with respect to location coordinates and providing automatically recognized data to the cloud server. In addition, real-time Internet of Things motion detection monitoring system was configured to quickly respond to real-time alerts and effectively manage problems. Therefore, installing real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform at an actual site will enable quick resolving of emergency situations through information provision and user awareness monitoring. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The integration of large amounts of renewable energy will require multiterminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) grids to reliably transport the energy over long distances. However, before building an MTDC grid, a functional protection system design is needed. Realistic and industrial studies are required to validate the functionality of such a system. In addition, further academic research as well as education in the field are needed. This paper presents an open-source, low-cost protection intelligent electronic device (IED) prototype for use in a laboratory environment. In particular, the IED design, its fastest measured performance, example results for different fault scenarios, and an assessment of its use in education are shown. The open-source IED is useful to accelerate industrial and academic research, as well as to enable education in protection for MTDC grids. © 1969-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Internet involvement in world industries development as activities integration media motivate Medium Industries of Indonesia to compete with Big Industries local and international. Medium Plastic Industries of Indonesia which experienced increasing demand become opportunities in developing integration by applying ERP Open Source to integrate activities in industries. The tested mobility aspect had shown that ERP can be accessed inside referral company scope in stable time with CV under 10%. Machine maintenance which support production activities cannot be done perfectly and gives high cost also long downtime. By creating ERP Open Source with maintenance module, failure prevention can be estimated by Weibull Distribution on production machine component failures. ERP estimation resulted very small error approximately 4% rather than analytical calculation for MTTF value and calculated perfectly for PDF and failure probability value. This estimation gave downtime and loss cost reduction more than 20% for the referral industry. © 2020 Int. J. Mech. Eng. Rob. Res.

AB  - As the benefits of Moore's Law diminish, computing performance, and efficiency gains are increasingly achieved through specializing hardware to a domain of computation. However, this limits the hardware's generality and flexibility. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), microchips which can be reprogrammed to implement arbitrary digital circuits, enable the benefits of specialization while remaining flexible. A challenge to using FPGAs is the complex computer-aided design flow required to efficiently map a computation onto an FPGA. Traditionally, these design flows are closed-source and highly specialized to a particular vendor's devices. We propose an alternate data-driven approach, which uses highly adaptable and retargettable open-source tools to target both commercial and research FPGA architectures. While challenges remain, we believe this approach makes the development of novel and commercial FPGA architectures faster and more accessible. Furthermore, it provides a path forward for industry, academia, and the open-source community to collaborate and combine their resources to advance FPGA technology. © 1981-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Nasal osteotomy is a commonly performed procedure during rhinoplasty for both functional and cosmetic reasons. Teaching and learning this procedure proves difficult due to the reliance on nuanced tactile feedback. For surgical simulation, trainees are traditionally limited to cadaveric bones, which can be costly and difficult to obtain. Objective: This study aimed to design and print a low-cost midface model for nasal osteotomy simulation. Methods: A 3D reconstruction of the midface was modified using the free open-source design software Meshmixer (Autodesk Inc). The pyriform aperture was smoothed, and support rods were added to hold the fragments generated from the simulation in place. Several models with various infill densities were printed using a desktop 3D printer to determine which model best mimicked human facial bone. Results: A midface simulation set was designed using a desktop 3D printer, polylactic acid filament, and easily accessible tools. A nasal osteotomy procedure was successfully simulated using the model. Conclusions: 3D printing is a low-cost, accessible technology that can be used to create simulation models. With growing restrictions on trainee duty hours, the simulation set can be used by programs to augment surgical training. © Michelle Ho, Jared Goldfarb, Roxana Moayer, Uche Nwagu, Rohan Ganti, Howard Krein, Ryan Heffelfinger, Morgan Leigh Hutchinson.

AB  - Currently beraprost sodium (BPS) is widely proposed to ameliorate the symptoms caused by chronic arterial occlusive disease. The objective of this study is to investigate the BPS pharmacokinetic characteristics, its vasodilating effect and the relationship between plasma concentration vs response effect. 12 healthy Chinese volunteers (6 male, 6 female) were chosen to participate in a single center, random, and open design study. After overnight fasting, BPS (dose = 40μg) was administrated orally to each volunteer. The blood samples were collected at different time points (from 0 to 5 h after administration) and BPS concentration was analyzed by LC-MS/MS method. The vasodilating effect was evaluated by detecting the skin microcirculation blood flow of volunteers’ fingers with laser Doppler fluxmetry. The Cmax of BPS was (601.14 ± 214.81) pg/mL, the Tmax was (0.58 ± 0.48) h, and AUC0-t was (1020.41±214.63) pg/mL·h. BPS exhibited significant vasodilating effect since the skin microcirculation blood flow increased definitely at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 h (all p&lt;0.05) after drug administration, and a positive correlation was presented between the pharmacokinetics and the vasodilating effect, which would be beneficial for guiding BPS dosage in clinical. © 2020 Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.

AB  - The variable stiffness joint is a kind of flexible actuator with variable stiffness characteristics suitable for physical human–robot interaction applications. In the existing variable stiffness joints, the antagonistic variable stiffness joint has the advantages of simple implementation of variable stiffness mechanism and easy modular design of the nonlinear elastic element. The variable stiffness characteristics of antagonistic variable stiffness joints are realized by the antagonistic actuation of two nonlinear springs. A novel design scheme of the equivalent nonlinear torsion spring with compact structure, large angular displacement range, and desired stiffness characteristics is presented in this article. The design calculation for the equivalent quadratic torsion spring is given as an example, and the actuation characteristics of the antagonistic variable stiffness joint based on the equivalent quadratic torsion spring are illustrated. Based on the design idea of constructing the antagonistic variable stiffness joint with compact structure and high compliance, as well as the different design requirements of the joints at different positions of the multi–degrees of freedom robot arm, nine types of mechanical schemes of antagonistic variable stiffness joint with the open design concept are proposed in this article. Finally, the conceptual joint configuration schemes of the robot arm based on the antagonistic variable stiffness joint show the application scheme of the designed antagonistic variable stiffness joint in the multi–degrees of freedom robot. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Soft continuum robots have the potential to revolutionize minimally invasive surgery. The challenges for such robots are ubiquitous; functioning within sensitive, unstructured and convoluted environments which are inconsistent between patients. As such, there exists an open design problem for robots of this genre. Research currently exists relating to the design considerations of on-board actuated soft robots such as fluid and tendon driven manipulators. Magnetically reactive robots, however, exhibit off-board actuation and consequently demonstrate far greater potential for miniaturization and dexterity. In this letter we present a soft, magnetically actuated, slender, shape forming 'tentacle-like' robot. To overcome the associated design challenges we also propose a novel design methodology based on a Neural Network trained using Finite Element Simulations. We demonstrate how our design approach generates static, two-dimensional tentacle profiles under homogeneous actuation based on predefined, desired deformations. To demonstrate our learnt approach, we fabricate and actuate candidate tentacles of 2 mm diameter and 42 mm length producing shape profiles within 8% mean absolute percentage error of desired shapes. With this proof of concept, we make the first step towards showing how tentacles with bespoke magnetic profiles may be designed and manufactured to suit specific anatomical constraints. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the wide implications of cognitive impairment for prognosis and outcome in schizophrenia, the research on pharmacological approaches aimed at addressing dysfunctional cognition has been extensive; nevertheless, there are no currently available licensed drugs, and the evidence in this field is still unimpressive. Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant, which has been proposed as a suitable treatment option for cognitive symptoms in depression. METHODS: Twenty schizophrenia outpatients (mean age ± SD, 40.7 ±10.6 years) on stable clozapine treatment, assessed by neuropsychological (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Verbal Fluency, and Stroop task) and psychodiagnostic instruments (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia), received vortioxetine at the single daily dose of 10 mg/d until week 12; the dose was increased at 20 mg/d afterward, and this dosage was maintained unchanged until week 24. A physical examination, electrocardiogram with QTc measurement, and laboratory tests were also performed. RESULTS: Vortioxetine supplementation significantly improved Stroop test (P = 0.013) at week 12 and Stroop test (P = 0.031) and Semantic Fluency (P = 0.002) at end point. Moreover, a significantly reduction of PANSS domains "positive" (P = 0.019) at week 12 and of PANSS domains positive (P = 0.019) and total score (P = 0.041) and of depressive symptoms (Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, P = 0.032) at end point. There was no significant change in clinical, metabolic, and safety parameters, and no subject spontaneously reported adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations (open design, lack of a control group, small sample size, and short intervention period), our findings suggest for the first time that vortioxetine augmentation of clozapine may be a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - Open source hardware has developed rapidly since the last 2 decades, thanks to access to Internet and availability of novel interactive manufacturing technologies (for example 3D printing or collaborative platforms). Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388–393, 2018) defined the “open-o-meter”, i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project’s process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects’ process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project’s process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project’s process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Free and open-source hardware (FOSH) is rapidly gaining momentum because it provides customized research hardware with over 90% savings compared to the costs of proprietary tools. However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84–27.7m€/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This report describes a direction-dependent optical microscope operated with Raspberry Pi, with LED array illumination patterns controlled by Raspberry Pi. Images are obtained with a Raspberry Pi camera module. We demonstrate the use of Raspberry-Pi-based microscopes for multimodal imaging including bright-field microscopy, dark-field microscopy, differential phase-contrast microscopy, and polarization microscopy. We also demonstrate acquisition of direction-dependent dark-field and differential phase-contrast images. From a pair of opposite line or rectangular illumination, structures along the illumination axis were enhanced in dark-field images and differential phase-contrast images. Raspberry-Pi is open-source hardware. Raspberry-Pi-based compact, cost-effective, and multi-contrast microscopes are expected to be useful for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Aim: Current pricing of commercial mechanical ventilators in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) markedly restricts their availability, and consequently a considerable number of patients with acute/chronic respiratory failure cannot be adequately treated. Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-tobuild noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cmH2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45±1.68 without support to 2.83±1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80±1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated. © 2020 ERS.

AB  - The complexity of power grids in terms of generation and consumption transforms the traditional power system to a distributed one. This new paradigm obliges to a better monitoring and control. Herein, we present a low cost and compact device that allows to measure, energy, voltages and currents in three-phase networks. In addition, it has been designed to analyse PQ disturbances. This device is a smart meter and can be considered internet-based power quality monitoring. The statistics data are processed locally with built-in custom software, specifically designed for this purpose, which provides energy consumption or generation patterns in multiple visualization views. The design is released as open hardware and therefore it is presented to the community as a powerful tool. The system was installed in a real photovoltaic power plant over a long time, showing interesting results and findings, which validates our proposal. © 2020, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - To extend the choice of inertial motion-tracking systems freely available to researchers and educators, this paper presents an alternative open-source design of a wearable 7-DOF wireless human arm motion-tracking system. Unlike traditional inertial motion-capture systems, the presented system employs a hybrid combination of two inertial measurement units and one potentiometer for tracking a single arm. The sequence of three design phases described in the paper demonstrates how the general concept of a portable human arm motion-tracking system was transformed into an actual prototype, by employing a modular approach with independent wireless data transmission to a control PC for signal processing and visualization. Experimental results, together with an application case study on real-time robot-manipulator teleoperation, confirm the applicability of the developed arm motion-tracking system for facilitating robotics research. The presented arm-tracking system also has potential to be employed in mechatronic system design education and related research activities. The system CAD design models and program codes are publicly available online and can be used by robotics researchers and educators as a design platform to build their own arm-tracking solutions for research and educational purposes. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction, repetitive behavior, and additional features, such as special interests. Its precise etiology is unclear. Recently, immunological mechanisms, such as maternal autoantibodies/infections, have increasingly been the subject of discussion. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigations play a decisive role in the detection of immunological processes in the brain. This study therefore retrospectively analyzed the CSF findings of adult patients with ASD. CSF basic measures (white blood cell count, total protein, albumin quotient, immunoglobulin G (IgG) index, and oligoclonal bands) and various antineuronal antibody findings of 36 adult patients with ASD, who had received lumbar puncture, were compared with an earlier described mentally healthy control group of 39 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. CSF protein concentrations and albumin quotients of patients with ASD were significantly higher as compared to controls (age corrected: p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively); 17% of the patients with ASD showed increased albumin quotients. After correction for age and gender, the group effect for total protein remained significant (p = 0.041) and showed a tendency for albumin quotient (p = 0.079). In the CSF of two ASD patients, an intrathecal synthesis of anti-glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibodies was found. In total, more of the ASD patients (44%) presented abnormal findings in CSF basic diagnostics compared to controls (18%; p = 0.013). A subgroup of the patients with adult ASD showed indication of a blood–brain barrier dysfunction, and two patients displayed an intrathecal synthesis of anti-GAD65 antibodies; thus, the role of these antibodies in patients with ASD should be further investigated. The results of the study are limited by its retrospective and open design. The group differences in blood–brain barrier markers could be influenced by a different gender distribution between ASD patients and controls. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to design and develop a new robotic device for the rehabilitation of the upper limbs. The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process. Design/methodology/approach: The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report. Findings: The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time. Research limitations/implications: There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction. Practical implications: Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices. Originality/value: The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments. Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The development of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has been a revolution for developmental biology as it allows long-term imaging during embryonic development. An important reason behind the quick adoption has been the availability of open hardware alternatives. In this work, we present a robust and compact version of a light-sheet fluorescence microscope that is easy to assemble and requires little to no maintenance. An important aspect of the design is that the illumination unit consists of reflective elements, thereby reducing chromatic aberrations an order of magnitude as compared to refractive counterparts. © 2020 Optical Society of America.

AB  - High-speed imaging equipment can be an expensive investment, especially when certain applications require custom solutions. In this paper, we present a low-cost high-speed prototype camera built on a low-end Zynq-7000 System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and off-the-shelf components with the aim of removing the entry barrier into various high-speed imaging applications. The camera is standalone (does not require a host computer) and can achieve 211 frames per second (fps) at its maximum resolution of 1280x1024, and up to 2329 fps at a 256x256 resolution. With a current cost of only several hundred dollars and resource utilization of ~5%, the open-source design’s modularity and customizability allows users with sufficient hardware or programming experience to modify the camera to suit their needs, potentially driving the cost lower. This can be done by utilizing the large remaining programmable logic for custom image processing algorithms, creating user interface software on the CPU, attaching extensions through the peripheral Module connections, or creating custom carrier or daughter boards. The development and design of the camera is described and a figure-of-merit is presented to provide a value assessment of some available commercial high-speed cameras against which our camera is competitive. Finally, the camera was tested to record low frequency spatial vibration and was found to be useful in investigating phenotypes associated with aging in a leading animal model, the nematode (worm) Caenorhabditis elegans. © 2020 Chalich et al.

AB  - Soft robots are intrinsic compliant machines capable of realizing complex movements by the deformation of their own body. They promise to overcome limitations presented by rigid robots in unstructured environments and in handling fragile objects. One of the recent interests in soft robotics is the development of techniques to design improved soft actuators. In this context, this work presents a density-based topology optimization formulation to design soft actuators driven by pressure loads. This formulation solves design-dependent load problems using mixed displacement-pressure finite elements to synthesize compliant mechanisms actuated by pressure loads. The objective of the optimization is to maximize the output displacement in a given direction while constraining the material volume. A projection technique is proposed to circumvent the appearance of open designs which are of non-interest. The optimization is solved by using an interior point algorithm (IPOPT). Three numerical examples are explored to evaluate the effectiveness of the formulation: a bending, a linear, and an inverter actuator. The numerical results show that the proposed projection technique is successful in finding optimized closed designs for the studied problems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, the generation and posterior chemometric resolution of third-order data, obtained from samples processed by liquid chromatography (LC) with online registering of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEM) is reported. Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyte (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Imaging and manipulating individual atoms with submicrometer separation can be instrumental for quantum simulation of condensed matter Hamiltonians and quantum computation with neutral atoms. Here we present an open-source design of a microscope objective for atomic strontium, consisting solely of off-the-shelf lenses, that is diffraction-limited for 461 nm light. A prototype built with a simple stacking design is measured to have a resolution of 0.63(4) µm, which is in agreement with the predicted value. This performance, together with the near diffraction-limited performance for 532 nm light, makes this design useful for both quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezer experiments with strontium. Our microscope can easily be adapted to experiments with other atomic species such as erbium, ytterbium, and dysprosium, as with rubidium Rydberg atoms. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB  - The ability to access, design and create low cost sensors capable of returning scientifically useful data has led to an exponential increase in citizen science, education and environmental monitoring groups. Low-cost spectroscopy is one such application and mobile phone camera-based instruments have been used in pollution monitoring, medical applications in developing countries and vegetation analysis. Can such an instrument be developed and tested to assist with automated detection of materials, possibly from space? We tested two spectrometer designs inside a two unit (2U) cubesat frame against a series of materials exhibiting phenomenology in the visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) portion of the spectrum and vegetation groups. This was conducted in order to determine whether open source designs were capable of discriminating against similar materials, such as types of vegetation or types of iron-rich minerals. A spectral pipeline was created using open source programming software that was capable of converting raw sensor data into spectra, comparing samples of interest against a spectral library and returning an identification result with a confidence interval. We found that low-cost hardware sensitive to NIR and freely available software were able to identify types of materials in the study set, enabling applications in citizen science, education and outreach or even low-cost near-space research. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Imaging underwater can be particularly problematic and expensive given the harsh environmental conditions posed by salinity and for some deployments, pressure. To counter these difficulties, expensive waterproof pressure resistant housings are often used, commonly built from expensive materials such as titanium, if intended for long duration deployments. Further, environmental investigations often benefit from replicate data collection, which additionally increases study costs. In this paper we present a new camera system, developed with off the shelf and 3D printed cost effective components for use in shallow waters of <150 m depth. Integrating Raspberry Pi Zero W microcomputers with open source design files and software, it is hoped these camera systems will be of interest to the global marine and freshwater research communities. © 2020

AB  - This paper presents the design, construction, operation, and validation of a robotic gantry platform specifically designed for studying fish-robot interaction. The platform has five degrees of freedom to manipulate the three-dimensional position, yaw angle, and the pitch of a lure. Additionally, it has a four-conductor slip ring that allows power and data to be transmitted to the lure for the operation of fins and other actuators that increase realism or act as stimuli to focal fish during an ethorobotic experiment. The design is open-source, low-cost, and includes purpose-built electronics, software, and hardware to make it extensible and customizable for a number of applications with varying requirements. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - An open-source precision pressure pump system and control software is presented, primarily designed for the experimental microfluidics community, although others may find additional uses for this precision pressure source. This mechatronic system is coined ‘µPump,’ and its performance rivals that of commercially available systems, at a fraction of the cost. The pressure accuracy, stability, and resolution are 0.09%, 0.02%, and 0.02% of the full span, respectively. The settling time to reach 2 bar from zero and stabilize is less than 2 s. Material for building a four-channel µPump (approx. $3000 USD) or an eight-channel µPump (approx. $5000 USD) is approximately a quarter, or a third of the cost of buying a high-end commercial system, respectively. The design rationale is presented, together with documented design details and software, so that the system may be replicated or customized to particular applications. µPump can be used for two-phase droplet microfluidics, single-phase microfluidics, gaseous flow microfluidics and any other applications requiring precise fluid handling. µPump provides researchers, students, and startups with a cost-effective solution for precise fluid control. © 2020

AB  - As the consumer individualization is becoming stronger and the customer demand is changing more frequently, the traditional manufacture-active design pattern cannot meet the demands of the present age. It is widely acknowledged that the individualization can be really realized if the consumer could participate in the product design process. At present, the large-scale consumer participation in product design process through Internet is quite prevalent, but the design methodology and theoretical foundation have never been concerned by previous studies. Aiming at these problems, an open design method of large-scale consumer participation was proposed, which could accurately map the consumer's fragmentation and fuzziness requirements to the product model. First of all, based on the similarity recommendation process, consumers were helped to improve their solutions. At the same time, the consumer's self-organizing clustering was realized. Then, based on rough set theory, the convergence decision of a large number of consumer solutions was realized. Finally, taking the washing machine design as an example, the open design process of large-scale consumer participation was illustrated, and the feasibility of the method was verified. © 2020, Editorial Department of CIMS.

AB  - Icebergs account for approximately half of the freshwater flux from the Greenland Ice Sheet and they can impact marine ecosystems by releasing nutrients and sediments into the ocean as they drift and melt. Parameterizing iceberg fluxes of nutrients and sediments to fjord and ocean waters remains a difficult task due to the complexity of ice-ocean interactions and is complicated by a lack of observations. Acquiring iceberg samples can be difficult and dangerous, as icebergs can break apart and roll without warning. Here we present open source design files for a small, lightweight ice coring drill that can be reproduced using modern computer numerical control (CNC) machining and 3D printing technology. This ice core drill can rapidly acquire small ice samples from icebergs and bergy bits using a standard commercial, off-the-shelf battery-operated hand drill. Design files and a recent field expedition to Northwest Greenland are described. Ice core collection required only 30 s, thereby minimizing risks to scientists. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.

AB  - In our modern world, many Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are being researched and developed. IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km2) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We report a simple means to build a model atomic force microscope (AFM) using 3D printing of thermoplastic materials that are commercially available. The model has many of the key parts of an actual AFM including a z-axis stage, an AFM head with a cantilever assembly, and a laser source that reflects off of the back of the cantilever. Using a magnet attached to the tip of the cantilever and a metal sample, this model AFM enables acquisition of force-distance profiles with characteristic snap-in, pull-off, separate, and contact regions. The model AFM was designed, printed, and used by first- and second-year undergraduate students. Through completion of this project, students learned scientific instrument design and construction via 3D printing and obtained first-hand practice in the measurement of force-distance profiles and the elastic constants of cantilevers. The open design of the model can easily accommodate additional capabilities in which students are interested, e.g., topographical scanning and using cantilevers made from different materials.

AB  - This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF educational robot manipulator with a gripper. The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments presented in the paper. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Tissue decellularization for generating extracellular matrices has become a staple of regenerative medicine in the recent decades, extending from the research setting to clinical usage. Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - A new open-hardware bioreactor capable of applying electrical field stimulation in conjunction with static or cyclic stretch is presented. Stretch is applied to cells by a specially designed elastomeric membrane with a central seeding region. The main interest of our approach is the fine control of the characteristics of stimulations in regard to timing and amplitude in a simple design based on affordable, easy to find components and 3D printable parts. Our approach opens the way to more complex protocols for electrical and/or mechanical stimulations, which are known important regulators of cardiac phenotypes. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - Abstract: An open-source syringe pump has been developed for use in the analytical laboratory. Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1%, and the random one was less than 3 μL.

AB  - Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate building energy assessments are often limited by inaccurate assumptions about the buildings' properties and occupant behavior. Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, there are different contexts of application where IoT can be applied such as: early warning systems, precision agriculture, monitoring of physiological variables, among others. Taking into account the above, the diversity of proprietary and open hardware and software technologies, it is necessary to have in academic environments a platform that makes it possible to generalize the development and facilitate integration of the layers of data visualization, capture, storage and analysis. This paper proposes as a contribution a portable academic platform for the construction of microservices in IoT environments. The proposed platform makes use of open hardware and software tools such as: JavaScript JQuery library, Python Flask framework, MongoDB, Raspberry PI and Arduino. This platform aims to guide different academic projects that involve rapid deployment and implementation of microservices for different application contexts associated with IoT. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - At present, the Internet of Things (IoT) theme has been disseminated in different application contexts. In the particular case of domotics and immotics, the use of technologies associated with IoT allows the safety, control and automation of different types of buildings. In spite of the above, given the diversity of technologies and considering that the commercial systems used in this context make use of proprietary technologies that are costly to use in academic contexts, it is therefore necessary to design and build alternative IoT systems, supported by free hardware and software technologies that allow experimentation and the construction of value-added services. In this article we propose as a main contribution the reference architecture of an IoT system for building control, making use of free technologies. Finally, a scale prototype obtained from the proposed architecture is presented. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social sustainability is a growing concern for supply chain management, but questionable practices endure due to insufficient stakeholder pressure on the market leading firms. Meanwhile small, socially oriented firms may have the will but lack the means to change dominant practices when entering a market. In this context 3D printing may offer a solution, by leveraging the voluntary effort of individuals through open design and distributed production. A system dynamics approach is applied to the case of a socially oriented mobile phone producer, whose fair supply chain practices may initially appeal only to a niche market. We examine how open design of 3D printed mobile phone accessories helps overcome size-related resource constraints, facilitate market growth and ultimately generate sufficient consumer demand to alter the market leaders’ supply chain practices, in favour of social sustainability. Our findings demonstrate the interaction between availability of 3D printers, consumer attitudes to social sustainability and the market entry. We discuss the implications for technology management, namely that 3D printing can help overcome resource constraints to support the diffusion of socially sustainable supply chain innovation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The founding of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) vision was originally presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1188 (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 1999), after many years of discussions and workshops, described in detail by Filson and Arabasz (2016). Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to "... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies."In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, includingmultitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores. © Seismological Society of America.

AB  - With the global electricity demand witnessing a 3.1 percent jump in 2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - With technologies rapidly evolving, many research institutions are now opting to invest in costly, high-quality, specialized microscopes which are shared by many researchers. As a consequence, the user may not have the ability to adapt a microscope to their specific needs and limitations in experimental design are introduced. A flexible work-horse microscopy system is a valuable tool in any laboratory to meet the diverse needs of a research team and promote innovation in experimental design. We have developed the Flexiscope; a multi-functional, adaptable, efficient and high-performance microscopy/electrophysiology system for everyday applications in a neurobiology laboratory. The core optical components are relatively constant in the three configurations described here: an upright configuration, an inverted configuration and an upright/electrophysiology configuration. We have provided a comprehensive description of the Flexiscope. We show that this method is capable of oblique infrared illumination imaging, multi-channel fluorescent imaging and automated three-dimensional scanning of larger specimens. Image quality is conserved across the three configurations of the microscope, and conversion between configurations is possible quickly and easily, while the motion control system can be repurposed to allow sub-micrometre computer-controlled micromanipulation. The Flexiscope provides similar performance and usability to commercially available systems. However, as it can be easily reconfigured for multiple roles, it can remove the need to purchase multiple microscopes, giving significant cost savings. The modular reconfigurable nature allows the user to customize the system to their specific needs and adapt/upgrade the system as challenges arise, without requiring specialized technical skills. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The control of refrigeration in the food chain is fundamental at all stages, with special emphasis on the retail stage. The implementation of information and communication technologies (IoT, open-source hardware and software, cloud computing, etc.) is representing a revolution in the operational paradigm of food control. This paper presents a low-cost IoT solution, based on free hardware and software, for monitoring the temperature in refrigerated retail cabinets. Specifically, the use of the ESP-8266-Wi-Fi microcontroller with DS18B20 temperature sensors is proposed. The ThingSpeak IoT platform is used to store and process data in the cloud. The solution presented is robust, affordable, and flexible, allowing to extend the scope of supervising other relevant parameters in the operating process (light control, energy efficiency, consumer presence, etc.). © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: In an open design, a 3-day high-residue diet was administered to healthy subjects (n = 74 included, n = 63 completed) before and following 28 days consumption of a fermented milk product (FMP) containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria. Main outcomes: digestive sensations, number of daytime anal gas evacuations, and gas volume evacuated during 4 h after a probe meal. Results: As compared to the habitual diet, the high-residue diet induced gas-related symptoms (flatulence score 4.9 vs. 1.2; p ≤ 0.0001), increased the daily number of anal gas evacuations (20.7 vs. 8.7; p < 0.0001), and impaired digestive well-being (1.0 vs. 3.4; p < 0.05). FMP consumption reduced flatulence sensation (by −1.7 [−1.9; −1.6]; p < 0.0001), reduced the number of daily evacuations (by −5.8 [−6.5; −5.1]; p < 0.0001), and improved digestive well-being (by +0.6 [+0.4; +0.7]; p < 0.05). FMP consumption did not affect the gas volume evacuated after a probe meal. Conclusion: In healthy subjects, consumption of a FMP containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria improves the tolerance of a flatulogenic diet by subjective and objective criteria (sensations and number of anal gas evacuations, respectively). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The phenomenon of end-user driven technological practices such as DIY making, hacking, crafting, and open design/manufacturing is shaping debates in HCI and CSCW about participatory innovation dynamics. However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely, unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier "pro-amateur" end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance of small teams, "crafting," and "democracy" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier end-users' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation. Understanding their practices and the socio-technological challenges that they face, therefore, informs the design of more participatory technologies that both allow hobbyists' and experts' innovation and support the technological practices performed by users who are at the middle-tier. This not only promotes the democratization of technology and bottom-up innovation but also adds nuance to existing literature on end-user driven technological practices. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge in development of Open Source Hardware, especially open source ventilators. Many of these open source ventilator projects have adopted an open-when-finished model due to legitimate legal and liability concerns. This, however, has led to a proliferation of projects with teams across the world independently designing over a hundred mutually incompatible ventilators, representing a huge amount of duplicated effort. A functioning design is necessary but not sufficient for a project to help patients. The device must be taken through regulatory approval by a manufacturer that understands why design decisions were taken. In this article we argue that the open design process developed for Open Source Software can be used for Open Source Hardware. This process not only allows remote teams to work together improving a single design, it also provides the rich history of design decisions that manufacturers need to take the device through regulatory approval. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Digital radiography devices are still the gold standard for diagnosis or therapy guidance in medicine. Despite the similarities between all direct digital X-ray systems, researchers and new companies face significant challenges during the development phase of innovative X-ray devices; each component is manufactured independently, guidance towards device integration from manufacturers is limited, global standards for device integration is lacking. Method: In scope of this study a plug-integrate-play (PIP) conceptual model for X-ray imaging system is introduced and implemented as an open hardware platform, SyncBox. The researchers are free to select each individual device component from different vendors based on their intended application and target performance are utilized in criteria. Result: As its first implementation, SyncBox and its platform a full body high resolution radiographic scanner that employs a novel TDI digital detector. Conclusion: We believe that SyncBox has a potential for introducing an open source hardware platform to X-ray equipment design. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization. In this paper, we investigate KM practices and needs in Open Source Hardware (OSH) communities. The aim is to provide insights into the KM issues and challenges facing these communities. Our analysis is based on interviews carried out with the participants of 22 projects. Interview transcriptions were coded and tagged with concepts extracted from the literature. Text mining was used to uncover the main concepts embedded in the corpus. From this analysis, knowledge sharing emerged as one of the top-rated concepts. Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations. High contributor turnover, little or no standardization and weak project structuring are still key challenges for OSH communities when it comes to ensuring awareness, making decisions and sharing knowledge. © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - The success of the emerging open-source hardware ecosystem critically depends on thoroughly tested open-source hardware blocks. Unfortunately, it is challenging to adopt traditional closed-source hardware testing approaches in the open-source hardware community. To tackle these challenges, we introduce PyH2, our vision for a productive and open-source testing methodology for open-source hardware. Leveraging PyMTL3, pytest, and hypothesis, PyH2 attempts to reduce the designers&#x2019; effort in creating high-quality property-based random tests. This paper introduces and quantitatively evaluates the benefits of three PyH2 frameworks: PyH2G for design generators, PyH2P for processors, and PyH2O for testing hardware with object-oriented interfaces.

AB  - Open-source designs are being increasingly used to develop robot hardware. When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The internet of things is rapidly becoming a fact of life. There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - We propose an open source hardware platform called Blinky, a sound-to-light conversion sensor that harvests sound power at low-rate and conveniently. Blinkies are made up of a central processing unit connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure. Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment. Finally, we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual Blinkies in highly reverberent environment. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The increased popularity of investigations and exploits in the fields of neurological rehabilitation, human emotion recognition, and other relevant brain-computer interfaces demand the need for flexible electrophysiology data acquisition systems. Such systems often require to be multi-modal and multi-channel capable of acquiring and processing several different types of physiological signals simultaneously in real-time. Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the entire chain of the HiCCE-128 electrophysiological data acquisition system. The system comprises of 128 independent channels capable of acquiring signal at 31.25 kHz, with 16 effective bits per channel with a measured noise level of about 3μV. The reliability and feasibility of the implemented system have been confirmed through a series of tests and real-world applications. The modular design methodology based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) standard allows the connection of the HiCCE-128 board to programmable system-on-chip carrier devices through the high-speed FMC link. The implemented architecture enables end users to add various high-response electrophysiological signal processing techniques in the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) part of the system on chip (SoC) device on each channel in parallel according to application specification. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a fuzzy inference system and microcontroller-based protection scheme for a combined underground (UG) cable and overhead (OH) transmission line system. The scheme detects, classifies, and locates the fault occurring either in an UG cable or OH transmission line network. Furthermore, the scheme identifies the faulty section. An existing Indian power network i.e., real power system network of C.G. state, consisting of 132 kV, 50 Hz power transmission network connecting Doma substation 220/132 kV to the 132/33 kV Gas Insulated Substation Rawanbhata through combined transmission network is considered. This real power transmission network is simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink software. In this paper, the hardware implementation is also carried out using an open-source hardware, Arduino, which consists of an Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller. Both the simulation and hardware results validate that the proposed scheme is accurately detecting, classifying, and locating the fault in less than a half cycle time. Moreover, the percentage error in determining the location of a fault is less than 0.7%. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recent advancements in whole slide imaging (WSI) have moved pathology closer to digital practice. Existing systems require precise mechanical control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists. Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI. The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of ∼0.7 μm. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm2 region in ∼2 mins with throughput comparable to existing high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly available and utilizable without loss of capacity. © 2019 Optical Society of America.

AB  - The paper provides an evolutionary model of industry development and learning within the wind power sector. Today this industry has attained a mature phase characterised by increased global competition, standardisation and stronger emphasis on process innovation. This leads to a greater emphasis on frugal innovation and on cost reduction strategies. The emerging and developing countries already account for 54% of global new investment in wind energy. Their share will continue to rise, particularly because of frugal design concepts and further efficiency improvements. The wind power sector also offers many opportunities for smart specialisation for new industry participants from emerging nations. Manufacturers from China, India, Brazil and several other countries have demonstrated successful strategies of industry development and international expansion. Brazil in particular represents a prototype case for developing wind power based on frugal design concepts. We have selected an illustrative case study of an advanced turbine blade manufacturer from Brazil, and on the interaction with foreign multinational firms. Finally, we also address learning processes in renewable energy policy. While feed-in tariffs often stimulate industry development during early phases, the transfer to an auctioning scheme tends to have a strong impact on price discipline and on frugal innovation.

AB  - Repeat observations underpin our understanding of environmental processes, but financial constraints often limit scientists’ ability to deploy dense networks of conventional commercial instrumentation. Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King’s College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors –0.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Emerged at the intersection of open-source, do-it-yourself and maker movements, and blurring of the lines among users, designers and producers, open design suggests a continuous process of co-designing open to everyone and demonstrates opportunities for repair, reuse and upgrading through transparent processes and design sharing. While such opportunities are conceptualized in literature, how they can (or should) be reflected in design is an open question worth exploring. This paper presents an exploratory study on product/part longevity, personalization and reuse to find out the implications of open design for transforming an already established product category like small kitchen appliances. For this purpose, research through co-designing methodology was developed and utilized through two design workshops on practices shaped around small kitchen appliances. The study revealed sustainable design considerations for idea-generation, open part properties that respond to them, the strategies for iterating open designs and their implications for product/part longevity, personalization and reuse. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical devices needed during the COVID-19 pandemic were widely reported in early 2020. In response, civic DIY volunteers explored how they could produce the required equipment. Members of communities such as hacker- and makerspaces employed their skills and tools to manufacture, for example, face shields and masks. The article discusses these civic innovation practices and their broader social implications by relating them to critical making theory. Methodologically, it is based on a digital ethnography approach, focusing on hacker and maker communities in the UK. Communities’ DIY initiatives display characteristics of critical making and ‘craftivism’, as they assessed and counteracted politicised healthcare supply shortages. It is argued that their manufacturing activities during the COVID pandemic relate to UK austerity politics’ effects on healthcare and government failure to ensure medical crisis supplies. Facilitated by open source design, communities’ innovation enabled healthcare emergency equipment. At the same time, their DIY manufacturing raises practical as well as ethical issues concerning, among other things, efficacy and safety of use. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL. Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences are suggested. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In ARM TrustZone-based architecture, shared memory is one of the most useful schemes to enable isolated execution environments supported by TrustZone to communicate between environments. However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products. CCBY

AB  - Architecture is never fixed: buildings and (urban) spaces change as their use(r)s and contexts change over time. Even when architectural projects receive recognition of their dynamic nature, it remains unclear how to deal with this during design processes. The need for sustainable building raises interest in this topic in architecture research. This interest converges with discourse on open design in other design fields. Work in human–computer interaction and industrial design engineering is generating more concrete design strategies that bring into view in design processes the dynamic with which artefacts become part of real (end-use) environments. Examples include open-ended design and open script design. We propose such strategies may enrich architectural education particularly in the face of the challenge to move towards a more sustainable architecture that changes meaningfully through time. In this article we explore the value of, and requirements for, teaching open design strategies in architectural education. In the context of a master course on actual topics in architecture we involved architectural engineering students as researchers to explore the value and applicability of these strategies in architectural design. Analysis of focus group interviews and students’ intermediary and final coursework suggests that open design makes explicit a topic that is latently present to these students in their education. They perceive open design as having high societal relevance that will help them in their future practice to approach (design) problems (e.g., including environmental and social challenges) in new ways. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper presents results from an experiment using electroencephalography to measure neurophysiological activations of mechanical engineers and industrial designers when designing and problem-solving. In this study, we adopted and then extended the tasks described in a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study reported in the literature. The block experiment consists of a sequence of three tasks: Problem-solving, basic design and open design using a physical interface. The block is preceded by a familiarizing pre-task and then extended to a fourth open design task using free-hand sketching. This paper presents the neurophysiological results from 36 experimental sessions of mechanical engineers and industrial designers. Results indicate significant differences in activations between the problem-solving and the open design tasks. The paper focuses on the two prototypical tasks of problem-solving layout and open design sketching and presents results for both aggregate and temporal activations across participants within each domain and across domains. © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - This article presents the realization of a low-cost wearable sensor system and its Python-based software that can measure and record relative head-torso angle, especially in sagittal plane. The system is mainly developed to track head-torso angle during walk in a clinical study. The open-hardware part of the system is composed of a pair of triaxial digital accelerometers, a microprocessor, a Bluetooth module and a rechargeable battery unit. The reception of the transmitted acceleration data, visualization, interactive sensor alignment, angle estimation and data-logging are realized by the developed open-source graphical user interface. The system is tested on a tripod for verification and on a subject for practical demonstration. Developed system can be constructed and used for ambulatory monitoring and analysis of relative head-torso angle. Open-source user interface can be downloaded and developed for further (different) algorithms and device hardware. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The paper presents an analysis of the evolution of Open Design and Open Manufacturing from 2000 to 2020. The two phenomena are examined by taking into account real experiences in these fields in order to track the most relevant developments. The first step of the research consisted in the identification of the best-known and most often-cited experiences, which have been collected into four different subsets, according to their type, and organized into a chronological visualization. The second step of the research involved the identification and description of three case studies, one for each of the main types: Instructables, OpenStructures and Precious Plastics. Finally, the paper identifies three main time frames, and expresses the constructive and the critical aspects of the two open processes, concluding with a speculation on three possible futures. © 2020 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

AB  - The constant growth of the Internet, driven by the demand for timely access to data center networks has meant that the technological platforms necessary to achieve this purpose are outside the current budgets. In this order to make and validate relevant, timely and relevant contributions, it is necessary that a wider community, access to evaluation, experimentation and demonstration environments with specifications that can be compared with existing networking solutions. This article introduces the NetFPGA, which is a platform to develop network hardware for reconfigurable and rapid prototyping. It introduces the application areas in high-performance networks, advantages for traffic analysis, packet flow, hardware acceleration, power consumption and parallel processing in real time. Likewise, it presents the advantages of the platform for research, education, innovation, and future trends of this platform. Finally, we present a performance evaluation of the tool called OSNT (Open-Source Network Tester) and shows that OSNT has 95% accuracy of timestamp with resolution of 10ns for the generation of TCP traffic, and 90% efficiency capturing packets at 10Gbps of full line-rate. © 2006-2020 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Purpose: Existing wheelchair (WC) designs lack independent toilet accessibility, transferability and indoor manoeuvrability combined in a WC. In this regard, a new WC model is proposed to simultaneously accommodate these distinct and essential features. In this open-source hardware project, the design, analysis and fabrication of a new active commode WC for indoor applications are performed. Materials and method: A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design. Results: The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access. Conclusion: The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.Implications for rehabilitation The expected outcomes and implications of the current commode WC project with regard to rehabilitation purpose are enlisted below: In the present scenario, a WC user is heavily dependent on external assistance to access private spaces in general and toilets in particular. The introduced model is capable to address this shortcoming by enabling the user to access the toilet utility directly by self propelling. Indeed, for a person with locomotor disability, a WC is the natural extension of his physical body. Thereby, this multipurpose commode WC design offers much Independence and greater flexibility to the indoor movements. The proposed design instils confidence to a WC user to access and transfer between facilities by means of self effort. Consequently it is expected to improve the quality of one’s personal life significantly. Importantly, this is an open-source project, those who are interested in rehabilitation motives can modify the present design to suit their local requirements especially in resource-limited settings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article presents the design and characterisation of a new low-power hardware platform to integrate unmanned aerial vehicle and wireless sensor technologies. In combination, these technologies can overcome data collection and maintenance problems of in situ monitoring in remote and extreme environments. Precision localisation in support of maximum efficiency mid-range inductive power transfer when recharging devices and increased throughput between drone and device are needed for data intensive monitoring applications, and to balance proximity time for devices powered by supercapacitors that recharge in seconds. The platform described in this article incorporates ultra-wideband technology to achieve high-performance ranging and high data throughput. It enables the development of a new localisation system that is experimentally shown to improve accuracy by around two orders of magnitude to 10 cm with respect to GNSS and achieves almost 6 Mbps throughput in both lab and field conditions. These results are supported by extensive modelling and analysis. The platform is designed for application fiexibility, and therefore includes a wide range of sensors and expansion possibilities, with source code for two applications made immediately available as part of a open source project to support research and development in this new area. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - Collaborative arrangements between users and designers today are enacted in a broadening array of circumstances. These include extended, even years-long projects within corporations, the public and third sectors, as well as open-ended, peer-to-peer open design initiatives. Building on a literature review and analysis of four concrete participatory design projects, in this paper we argue that besides skills in selecting and implementing co-design methods, there is a larger repertoire of issues that need attention, if one takes the promises and limits of participatory design seriously. We elaborate on how these issues have purchase in the interplay of four interrelated domains: the strategic considerations that drive all those implicated, the mundane acts involved in co-design work, the choice of methods that is conditioned by strategic and mundane issues, and the producing of design outcomes permeated in turn by all the above. These domains co-constitute each other in such a way that one domain cannot easily be considered apart from the others. Participatory design understood from this perspective is not about facilitation skills, but rather skills to translate among strategic, mundane, method and design domains, and being aware of how they qualify and permeate each other in order to achieve results. © 2020 Botero, Hyysalo, Kohtala, & Whalen.

AB  - The sowing-fertilizing machines used in the mexican field use mechanical systems to drive the feeders. In developed countries, these systems are being replaced by mechatronic systems applied in variable dosing machines. Mechatronic systems have the advantage that their performance is not affected by the conditions of the soil and vegetation cover, in addition to the ease of making changes in the dose of input supplies, by allowing them to be carried out continuously and in real time. However, they have the disadvantage of their high acquisition cost. This study presents the laboratory test results of a mechatronic system developed with low-cost free hardware and software, and adapted to the Model LC-U-N seeder-fertilizer from the manufacturer Sembradoras del Bajío S. A de C. V. The seed dispenser was tested to the standard of the corn seed greased belt described in ISO 7256-1:1984. The results show good seed distribution quality at rotation frequencies of the seed disk of 0.524 to 2,199 rad s-1, obtaining feeding quality indexes ≥ 90%, seed loss and multiplicity less than 6 % and precision <18 %. The fertilizer and pesticide dispensers were tested based on the mexican standard NMX-O-222- SCFI-2004, with commercial UREA fertilizer, using five rotation frequencies in the range of 0.524 to 3.77 rad s-1 and 1047 to 14,661 rad s-1, respectively, with different openings of the outlet gate. In the case of the fertilizer dispenser, an application dose of 3 to 562 kg ha-1 was obtained with the best performance when using gate openings ≤ 50 %, while the pesticide dispenser presented excellent performance, with which it was obtained an application rate of 0.004 to 16.4 kg ha-1. © 2020

AB  - This article argues for the exploration of and experimentation with the potentials of civic technoscience as a way of materializing counterdominant practices in human-rights activism that may challenge conventional uses of technology and rooted understandings of expertise. It examines the Ground Truth project, which addresses the Palestinian-Bedouin struggle for indigenous rights in the Naqab desert, in the southern region of Israel/Palestine. It focuses on the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial photography with balloons and kites, alongside other collaborative practices, for mapping and visualizing Bedouin political and spatial claims. Against a backdrop of increasingly technologically savvy legal-professional cultures in human-rights organizations, this article proposes that a community-based DIY approach to truth making may challenge entrenched thresholds of participation and open opportunities for creating hybrid forums in the human-rights field. Finally, it suggests that civic technoscience can offer an experimental ground for training oneself in critical ways of thinking and engaging with technology.

AB  - The term 'metabolism' identifies the set of chemical processes that occur within a living organism in order to maintain its life. By analogy, we use the 'urban metabolism' concept showing the life of a city. A city is a set of very complex processes involving both public and private stakeholders, areas and infrastructures. Urban metabolism can be analysed and therefore its status evaluated based on measuring specific parameters in order to offer sustainable services for people. The internet of things (IoT) paradigm helps the collection of large amounts of data that become available for decision makers and city managers to improve the urban metabolism. Based on these consideration, in this paper we present and discuss the Arancino.ccTM architecture, in order to achieve 'green' benefits: a better quality of life, a more efficient city management also optimising energy consumptions and costs. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the fusion of project-based learning (PBL) and collaborative learning (CL) cohesively, coordinated with sensors and Bluetooth advancements, open-source programming, and open-source equipment devices, in a specific microcontroller and installed frameworks designing apply autonomy course for the elementary learners. The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the “Arduino” open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In operating rooms with unidirectional air flow a wake is formed below the light. The influence of the geometry on the dimension of the wake and the age of air were investigated by means of validated numerical simulations as well as experimental measurements. The vertical dimension of the wake caused by the circular surgical light was 1.08 m in height. With an air-permeable shape, it could be reduced to 0.38 m (brim) to 0.28 m (centre). A more open design increased the dilution within the recirculating area and resulted in a shorter residence time of contaminants. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The effects of impulsive loading and deformation damage in reinforced concrete slabs were observed for analyzing the under-construction buildings for specific period of time. To fully harvest the structural capacity of building under constrcution with reinforced slabs sections exposed to combined actions, it is necessary to leave behind the simplicity of treating the verification of structural adequacy for normal stresses separately from that of shear stresses and instead fully exploit the advantages of choosing more efficient stress distributions. By exploring the vast possibilities of other statically admissible systems using optimization routines for deformation damage reduced to 20% from 80% in the work, the longitudinal reinforcement near the neutral axis in reinforced concrete can be utilized much more efficiently. In addition, by adhering to the interdependency constraints between normal and shear stresses in reinforced concrete a much more precise picture of the actual service stress state can be determined for impulsive loading and deformation damage where the maximum deformation and impulsive loading on RC-slab were observed at strain 91s < t < 97s on RC-slab in the total simulation steps from Os to 398s. There is therefore a need for a one- step, automated design tool capable of addressing such verifications holistically which was performed in the simulation of this study using Matlab R2019b. In this paper the theoretical basis and a free to use open-source design tool is presented, allowing for easy access to highly optimized designs capable of observing the impulsive loading and deformation damage on reinforced concrete materials to their limits © 2020

AB  - Multi-/Many-core architectures are emerging as scalable, high-performance and energy-efficient computing platforms suitable for a variety of application domains from edge to cloud computing. Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The laboratory is a research powerhouse being a transportation membrane to propagate new and proven knowledge. This paper aims to descriptively disseminate the concept of horizontal integration with emphasize on Internet of Things (IoT) from research in tropical functional food resources to teaching excellence framework. The five-stage framework includes (1) vision internalization, (2) persistence propagation, (3) new technology adaptation, (4) extending collaboration, and (5) outcome integration. The vision internalization stage produces a better understanding of the big picture and systematic approach. The experience is then brought to Research Methodology and Research Design classes. Persistence propagation may be better translated to relentlessly solving the problem and to increase the laboratory power, including providing fail-safe and verification procedures of possibly dubious results produced in the laboratory. The research may improve operating procedures or methods in a laboratory manual. The movement of open hardware dan IoTmakes it possible for faster technology adaptation to food-laboratory. IoT is integrated into the closest courses. When an integration requires expansion and collaboration, students are prepared to conduct functional food research in partner laboratories. The outcome integration fully materialized when enough new and related knowledge are accumulated. Researchers may visit and align the current curriculum in the subject of Functional Food Technology. In summary, the horizontal integration with emphasize on IoT results in a unique set of research-teaching excellence framework that is incrementally developed. © International Association of Online Engineering.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation is commonly used for environmental thermal regulation inside closed-field agricultural production systems. Analyzing the air distribution inside these facilities and the correct operation of the fans can be a challenging. This could be determined using cost prohibitive techniques as particle image velocimetry or deploying large wind sensors networks on-site. To avoid this limitation without a lack of measurement accuracy, this research was focused on developing and test a low-cost anemometer network based in low cost propeller’s anemometers, built using fused 3D-printed and open-hardware platforms. Four propeller anemometers with three to six blades were simulated using the 6-DOF method of ANSYS computer fluid dynamics software. Similar results were obtained for all the simulated models with minor differences. Anemometers were tested in an open circuit wind tunnel before to be evaluated in two open compost dairy barn building using high-volume low-speed and low-volume high-speed fans. Data were analyzed by employing contour maps, descriptive statistics and correlation. The results show that the anemometer network determines the fan’s wind profile for wind speeds over 0.7 m s-1 and it was possible to determine the facilities spots with ventilation problems. The proposed anemometer network and methodology are a good alternative to analyze the operating conditions of the tested agricultural facilities and optimize its performance. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Building novel analytical systems requires various elements: Sensors, a sampling system and data evaluation software. For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: “LABI-Imaging” for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and “RmsiGUI”, a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers’ community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research studied the feasibility in applying the flight controller of the unmanned aerial vehicle on a pontoon boat in fish farming industry. A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer. A 23 factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peakto-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed. The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly. With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle. © 2020, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

AB  - This paper introduces SiQAD, a computer-aided design tool enabling the rapid design and simulation of computational assemblies of atomic silicon quantum dots. SiQAD consists of several simulation tools: a ground state electron configuration finder, a non-equilibrium electron dynamics simulator, and an electric potential landscape solver for the exploration of field-driven modulation with electrodes. Simulations have been compared against past experimental results to inform the electron population estimation and dynamic behavior. Fundamental logic building blocks and circuits suitable for this platform have been designed and simulated, and a clocked wire has been demonstrated. This work paves the way and provides the first set of open design tools for the exploration of the emerging design space of atomic silicon quantum dot circuits. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Paper aims: the purpose of this study is to analyze how Open Innovation (OI) activities occur in Product Development Processes (PDP) and in the design of new products. Originality: the study is based on a self-developed and conducted survey, applied to engineers and managers working in departments involving product development and innovation among the Brazilian automakers. Research method: the method adopted is that of a questionnaire-based survey. Results are analyzed through a principal component analysis, followed by ordinary least squares regressions, in order to test the hypotheses proposed. Main findings: results suggest that inbound practices were more present than outbound practices, with a strong presence of the supplier in the design process (and not so much of a user-centered approach). Correlation between an organizational culture that favors OI and adoption to newer PDP methods and tools indicate that adopting newer product development methodologies and technologies could lead to a more "open" design process. Implications for theory and practice: the research provides an overview of open innovation within the Brazilian automakers, and reports what could be opportunities for the automotive industry to head towards. © 2020.

AB  - Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (VIV-TAVR) provides a safe and effective treatment option for failing surgical aortic bioprostheses. Self-expanding supra-annular valves offer optimal haemodynamics for this clinical application. The Acurate Neo transcatheter heart valve (THV) offers further unique advantages with stabilisation arches to assist with alignment, upper crowns to restrain bioprosthetic valve leaflets, rapid final opening coaxial to the left ventricular outflow tract and an open design that optimises future coronary access. We report our procedural technique and experience using the Acurate Neo THV in four VIV-TAVR implantations for patients aged between 70 and 81 yrs. All patients presented with severe symptomatic valvular aortic regurgitation (AR), one of whom was in cardiogenic shock. The patients had malfunctioning surgical bioprostheses (stented n = 3; stentless n = 1) ranging in size from 21 to 25 mm. The Acurate Neo THV was successfully implanted in all patients without any complications, residual AR, coronary compromise or need for permanent pacing. Length of stay was 2 to 7 days. Follow-up to 12 months revealed no adverse events. The Acurate Neo THV is an attractive self-expanding option for patients with AR due to degeneration of a surgical aortic valve bioprosthesis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Due to a lack of autonomy and difficulty in social interactions, people with physical disabilities generally suffer from a diminished quality of life. The following document describes the development of a low-cost mobile platform capable of assisting people with severe motor disabilities on independent social interactions.Platform requires a wireless mobile base; adapting two interaction devices, a camera and an eye tracker; and developing a software to integrate all components for an easy-to-use application. Then, in order to validate the operation of the platform, several tests were carried out, using a usability measurement methodology, with different users within a certain age range, with and without disabilities. Consequently, as a first instance of validation, the low-cost platform fulfills the expected function of social interaction assistance for people with disabilities. Finally, as it is an open design and its functioning has been verified, all the necessary information for the construction of the device is freely accessible through the project's electronic page. © 2020 Universitat Politecnica de Valencia.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens to overwhelm our medical infrastructure at the regional level causing spikes in mortality rates because of shortages of critical equipment, like ventilators. Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings. © 2020 Pearce JM.

AB  - To investigate the long-term (up to 20 years) outcomes of customized post copings (PC) and to evaluate potential factors influencing the risk for complications. Materials and Methods: Patients treated with PC-retained overdenture prostheses (OD) in a university setting were selected. Data collected included dental and periodontal parameters, periapical radiographs, and assessment of the OD design. Patientreported satisfaction levels were evaluated using visual analog scales (VAS), and 20-year cumulative survival and success rates were calculated. Results: A total of 73 patients with 81 ODs and 152 PCs were included. PC survival rate was 80.9%, and the success rate amounted to 64.5% after a mean observation period of 105.4 (± 67.9; range: 6 to 240) months. The 20-year cumulative PC rates were 91.5% for survival and 79.3% for success. Activation of matrices was more frequent with ball attachments than with cylindrical retention (odds ratio [OR] 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2 to 0.94; P =.034). Cylindrical retention was rateP d significantly better at 96% (interquartile range [IQR] 89.5% to 100%) compared to ball attachment at 88% (IQR 79% to 98.2%; P =.012). The risk for PC complications was higher for OD designs with coverage of the periodontal tissues compared to open designs (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78; P =.010). Conclusion: Customized PCs on natural abutment teeth for the retention of ODs are a valid treatment in partially dentate patients. Correct prosthesis design and integration into a regular dental hygiene program are mandatory factors for long-term success. © 2020 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.

AB  - Open source hardware for scientific equipment needs to provide source files and enough documentation to allow the study, replication and modification of the design. In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment. © 2019 Machado et al.

AB  - In this article we present a new low-cost physiological signal acquisition platform in compliance with Open-Source Hardware philosophy. The device contains an electrocardiography circuit; two electrodermal activity channels that implement a time-multiplexing technique to remove inter-channel coupling interference; and a skin temperature module. These features make the platform suitable for experiments involving Affective Computing. We have assessed the performance of this device in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Background Noise Level (BNL), an adapted MPEG7 feature for electrocardiography signals. This platform outperforms other commercial devices and most similar state-of-art studies on SNR. Results show values of 11.96, 30.01, 68.40 dB for ECG, EDA and ST, respectively, for SNR, and -28.31 dB for BNL in ECG. Both features were obtained by sampling physiological signals at a frequency of 256 Hz. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGAs, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature codebase reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Fiber photometry is the process of recording bulk neural activity by measuring fluorescence changes in activity sensitive indicators such as GCaMP through an optical fiber. We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Azimuthal beam scanning eliminates the uneven excitation field arising from laser interference in through-objective total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware, API, and software, is available online for community-based development and collaboration. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Large scale deployment of Smart Grids (SGs) and Smart Micro-Grids (SMGs) requires overcoming problems related to interoperability and high costs. To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are reported. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although microscopes and image-analysis software for electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) have improved dramatically in recent years, specimen-preparation methods have lagged behind. Most strategies still rely on blotting microscope grids with paper to produce a thin film of solution suitable for vitrification. This approach loses more than 99.9% of the applied sample and requires several seconds, leading to problematic air-water interface interactions for macromolecules in the resulting thin film of solution and complicating time-resolved studies. Recently developed self-wicking EM grids allow the use of small volumes of sample, with nanowires on the grid bars removing excess solution to produce a thin film within tens of milliseconds from sample application to freezing. Here, a simple cryo-EM specimen-preparation device that uses components from an ultrasonic humidifier to transfer protein solution onto a self-wicking EM grid is presented. The device is controlled by a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and all components are either widely available or can be manufactured by online services, allowing the device to be constructed in laboratories that specialize in cryo-EM rather than instrument design. The simple open-source design permits the straightforward customization of the instrument for specialized experiments. © 2019.

AB  - The Fiji Islands, like many small Pacific island nations, are thought to incur high rates of postharvest loss. Little work has been undertaken to quantify the amount of loss within Pacific horticultural value chains, or identify the key determinants. This study sought to quantify postharvest loss within Fijian smallholder tomato value chains and to examine the relative importance of current on-farm practices as possible contributors to this loss. A semi-structured survey of 115 smallholder tomato farmers in Sigatoka Valley and eastern Viti Levu was undertaken, covering socio-economic and demographic parameters, production and postharvest handling practice, and postharvest loss based on farmer recall. On-farm postharvest loss for smallholder farmer tomato value chains was between 26.1% in Sigatoka Valley and 27.6% in eastern Viti Levu. This finding was consistent with quantification of postharvest loss in Fijian tomato chains by direct determination, but is relatively high when compared to smallholder tomato value chain loss in Sub-Saharan Africa. When Fijian tomato value chains were segregated according to specific postharvest handling practice, the contributors to postharvest loss were often associated with on-farm decision-making. Those value chains that only harvested once a week, or in the early morning (before 7 am) or mid-day onwards, stored harvest product in the field for more than three hours, did not sort or grade prior to on-farm ripening, or used packing sheds that had relatively open designs, all had consistently higher levels of postharvest loss. The prevalence of specific postharvest handling practice in both locations is further reported. While this study highlights the impact of current on-farm postharvest handling practices on tomato value chain loss, what remain unclear are the underlying drivers associated with current postharvest handling behaviour and the decision-making that shapes quality and logistic control activities. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to propose an integrated methodology for evaluating academic spin-offs (ASOs) for supporting both the development phase and performance evaluation. The ASOs have peculiar characteristics compared to other start-up companies and the debate on their evaluation is still open. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed methodology, adopting a lean approach, faces the typical problems that characterize the growth of an ASO: the excessive attention to the technological aspects with respect to the commercial and managerial ones; and the need for evaluation systems that try to evaluate all risk areas and to highlight any misalignment. The methodology was built also starting from the results of an Erasmus + research project, co-funded by the European Commission, called spin-off lean acceleration. Findings: The methodology proposes to monitor the main risk areas (market, technological, implementation, governance and financial). For each of these areas, at first, a framework and a checklist are proposed for supporting the qualitative assessment of the potential of each areas. In the second part, a set of metrics for monitoring the performances and to understand if the spinoff is developing in the right direction is proposed. Moreover, the methodology was applied to the spin-offs at the University of Calabria (Italy), and the paper reports the first results obtained. Originality/value: A new canvas model (lean acceleration canvas), more specific and suited to the context of ASOs, was developed and tested. A lean approach has been adopted also for understanding the weakness of traditional methods. The proposed methodology could be used by the technology transfer offices in their institutional activity of supporting ASOs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent electronic device (IED) utilized for automatic meter readings (AMR) scheme using “Open-Source” software. This IED is utilized to measure a low-voltage intelligent electronic device) system with a boundless number of sensors, and it is accessible on the Internet of Things (IoT). The utilized equipment for this task is Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and fringe sensors, which are used for measurement of the referenced information. The Arduino motherboard is used not only for sole tranquility of equipment but also for serving as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) switch for the sensors. The personal computer is utilized to gather information and perform client-side calculations. The server works based on an open-source program written in Java programming language. The underlying objective of the proposed scheme is to make the meter based on the “Do It Yourself” methodology which requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of measured information and convenience for the conclusive client. The information is measured in just about 1 ms which is superb for custom-designed IED. Furthermore, the measured qualities are calculated based on their RMS values to be used for analyzing and further presentation of data. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware–embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for Arduino™ and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino™ or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

AB  - Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the low-cost of high performance optoelectronic and robotics components has supported a resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. We describe a low cost (below $700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed ‘lab-on-a-comb’ to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of ~420 × 300mm, which allows 29 ‘lab-on-a-comb’ devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1μl samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes. © 2019 Needs et al.

AB  - Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and low signal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform (shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signals with better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule‐based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The retention model by Rao and Buri is often used to characterize microparticles and other drug delivery systems for their bio-adhesive properties. Currently, these experiments are performed on customized setups, reducing reproducibility of results obtained in different labs. As a solution, we propose a fully replicable retention model, which can be constructed by parts mostly made by 3D printing and laser cutting as well as a limited amount of other easy to source and commercially available parts. In addition of being fully replicable, the setup features integration of a climate-controlled chamber, a peristaltic pump and an autosampler, thereby enabling fully automated but customized control of the experiments. Using the presented retention model setup and an automated experimental sequence, the setup has been proven capable of investigating mucoadhesion of differently shaped particles to porcine intestinal tissue. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Syringe pumps are widely used in a multitude of tasks where precise volumes of an extrudate need to be delivered at a specific flow rate. In the past decade various open source syringe pump designs have accelerated scientific research and exploration by reducing costs and introducing new ideas. To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems. Here the dosing accuracy and repeatability of the Ystruder are quantified, and we demonstrate its functionality both as a syringe pump and a paste extruder for 3D printing. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person households, it is absolutely necessary to observe the indoor activities of marginalized people, such as the elderly or the disabled, to detect abnormal conditions. At this time, contact sensors are have limited applicability due to their continuous wear, so there is a need to develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing management prescription guidelines through risk detection. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Electromyography (sEMG) is the technique applied to measure the bio-potential signal produced by a contracting skeletal muscle. sEMG has been used for subject intention estimation, force estimation, limb angle estimation and determining muscle activation timing. Typically most sEMG devices on the market, and in literature, are not open source hardware. This results in a device that can be considered as a black box, as it is difficult to determine the applied signal processing. This paper presents an open source low-cost active sEMG circuit, allowing an understanding of sEMG and the challenges involved in designing a high quality device. An open source sEMG design reduces the time and cost associated with initial sEMG research, providing a larger number of researchers with the opportunity to utilise sEMG. The device has been tested on three subjects, resulting in a low baseline noise ⩽5.2μVrms and great line noise rejection, resulting in a sensitive device that can capture high quality bio-potential signals. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - The price of renewable energy is dropping rapidly. Energy storage will be needed to take full advantage of abundant but intermittent energy sources. Even with economies of scale, the price is prohibitively high for a lithium-ion battery pack capable of storing tens of kilowatts of energy for many consumers. A more abundant and less expensive material is necessary. All-iron chemistry presents a transformative opportunity for stationary energy storage: it is simple, cheap, abundant, and safe. All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode. The total cell is highly stable, efficient, non-toxic, and safe. The total cost of materials is $0.1 per watt-hour of capacity at wholesale prices. This battery may be a useful component of open source hardware projects that require a safe and ecologically friendly battery. This is also one of the few battery chemistries that can be built safely in a DIY setting. © 2019

AB  - Reliable, accurate, and affordable linear motion control systems for precision agriculture applications are currently not easily accessible due to their elevated cost. Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents an open-source and low-cost characterization device designed to investigate the behavior of active textiles, which are textiles having the ability to actuate (produce motion/force) and or act as a sensor. Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - We propose a new, fully open-source, low-cost, and small-sized Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) for measuring near-surface water quality in real time in various environments. Existing commercial USVs are expensive and not fully based on open-source hardware, making it difficult to purchase them and to modify their designs and programming to suit various environments. In contrast, the USV platform proposed in this paper is completely open-source, from hardware to software; most parts of the platform can be 3D-printed, and it can be easily modified and upgraded in terms of both design and programming. The platform is equipped with off-the-shelf water sensors for acquiring data like as pH, turbidity, and temperature to measure water quality in real water resources (such as ponds, reservoirs, and lakes). Furthermore, we provide an Android application through which users can easily control the USV via Bluetooth and display the sensor and GPS data the platform generates. We validated the performance of the platform in terms of usability, mobility, and stability through field experiments in various locations, including both the USA and Peru. Moreover, we present a potential application and approach in which this platform can navigate autonomously by utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Bluetooth protocols. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - In order to provide dynamic adaptation of the performance/energy tradeoff, systems today rely on heterogeneous multicore architectures (different micro-architectures on a chip). These systems are limited to single-ISA approaches to enable transparent migration between the different cores. To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software equivalent. The impact on the total execution time of applications and the quality of generated binaries are also measured. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Recent progress in neuro-prosthetic technology gives rise to the hope that in the future blind people might regain some degree of visual perception. It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to ±70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The majority of bird and bat species are incapable of carrying tags that transmit their position to satellites. Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3° and 6.8°, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Quality assurance detectors comprising cameras and a scintillator volume are of interest for use in spot scanning proton therapy due to its dynamic delivery. In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 ×20× 20 cm)were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV)with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1–1000 ms)using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% ± 0.4% for low SNR (∼20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms)to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future. © 2019

AB  - This work demonstrates an open-source hardware and software platform for monitoring the performance of buildings, called Elemental, that is designed to provide data on indoor environmental quality, energy usage, HVAC operation, and other factors to its users. It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Data collection by conservation biologists is undergoing radical change, with researchers collaborating across disciplines to create bespoke, low-cost monitoring equipment from open-source hardware (OSH). Compared to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs. Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3) lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Identifying the importance weights of engineering characteristics (ECs) is essential for allocating resources in product design. Quality function deployment (QFD) is widely used for rating ECs to satisfy consumer requirements (CRs). In existing approaches, ECs were rated by designers from CRs. With the development of the Internet, open design (OD) is exerting an increasing important effect, and consumers can freely express their requirements for the product. However, in OD environment there will be a large number of CRs expressed using the free text without the guide of purposive questions and the CRs are characterized by uncertainty and diversity of meaning, which makes it hard to rate ECs using the previous methods. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes an extended probabilistic language method based on fuzzy QFD to determine the importance weights of ECs according to the context of CRs in OD. The method focuses on considering the impact of the words in CRs to identify the relationships between CRs and ECs in OD. Meanwhile, a calculated model and a utility-based evaluation approach are suggested to rate ECs based on the fuzzy QFD. An example of the smartphone is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The housing crisis has received growing interest from academia, industry, and policymakers. Open construction systems have emerged as a promising solution to achieve long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In this paper, extensive fieldwork was conducted to investigate a case of an open construction system, namely, the WikiHouse Den Bosch. The research framework builds on a combined view of two main concepts: "conviviality" and "openness". The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two aspects and the literature regarding "Design Global Manufacture Local". The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and context-specific factors. The paper concludes by outlining the need for an "institutionalized conviviality" to open up new pathways for future practice to address sustainability issues. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The use of animal-borne devices in wildlife studies is increasing due to the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs. Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present ‘OpenDropOff’, an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala’s unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid/liquid separator constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The separator-whose performance is competitive with far costlier commercial systems-is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for its firmware. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In view of the future lack of human resources due to the aging of the population, the automatic, Intelligent Mechatronic Systems (IMSs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have broad application prospects. However, complex application scenarios and limited open design resources make designing highly efficient ITS systems still a challenging task. In this paper, the optimal load factor solving solution is established. By converting the three user requirements including working distance, time and load into load-related factors, the optimal result can be obtained among system complexity, efficiency and system energy consumption. A specialized visual navigation and motion control system has been proposed to simplify the path planning, navigation and motion control processes and to be accurately calculated in advance, thereby further improving the efficiency of the ITS system. The validity of the efficiency calculation formula and navigation control method proposed in this paper is verified. Under optimal conditions, the actual working mileage is expected to be 99.7%, and the energy consumption is 83.5% of the expected value, which provides sufficient redundancy for the system. In addition, the individual ITS reaches the rated operating efficiency of 95.86%; in other words, one ITS has twice the ability of a single worker. This proves the accuracy and efficiency of the designed ITS system. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Open-source technology for supporting the Industry 4.0 has become the target of academic research in many sectors. This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors. © 2019, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc.

AB  - At the lowest layer of today's communication networks is an optical line system (OLS), a physical network of equipment, which carries high-frequency analog light signals over thousands of kilometers. Traditionally, an OLS was delivered as a turn-key solution by a single vendor. Within an OLS, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) are active devices responsible for routing spectral chunks between input and output ports. ROADMs are arguably the most complex physical component of an OLS. In this paper, we describe an open design of a Czech Light ROADM, including the optical hardware, electronics, software, and the northbound communication interface. The performance of the ROADMs is evaluated in two test scenarios. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this article I provide an account of key tensions shaping the development of autonomous driving technologies, and explore how such tensions can open up avenues for counter-mapping the data spaces produced through these navigation technologies. The design and massive commercialization of autonomous vehicles implies the production of new models of space, generated through the integration of data collected through technologies such as lidar scanning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This production of space is bounded within the confines of the technological black boxes of the vehicles themselves, as well as the corporate black boxes of the companies that design and deploy them. However, there are key sources of tension surrounding the creation of these black boxes: those between market competitors; between the state and the private sector; and between civil society, the private sector, and the state. In this article I explore these tensions by focusing on the potential for counter-mapping as a means of critique, transparency, and political action across three separate aspects of the autonomous driving space-making process: (1) legislation, by examining the emergence of Right to Repair laws across the United States, beginning with the Automotive Right to Repair Law passed in Massachusetts in 2012; (2) design, through open source projects for building self-driving cars, exemplified by Udacity, a pioneer in this area; and (3) hacking, specifically interventions designed to open, critique, or disrupt autonomous driving technologies. These examinations are embedded in a political economic account that interrogates the ownership and control over the spaces produced through autonomous driving, as well as the economic value associated with such production of space. © by the author(s).

AB  - Digital holographic microscopy is an emerging, potentially low-cost alternative to conventional light microscopy for micro-object imaging on earth, underwater and in space. Immediate access to micron-scale objects however requires a well-balanced system design and sophisticated reconstruction algorithms, that are commercially available, however not accessible cost-efficiently. Here, we present an open-source implementation of a lens-less digital inline holographic microscope platform, based on off-the-shelf optical, electronic and mechanical components, costing less than $190. It employs a Blu-Ray semiconductor-laser-pickup or a light-emitting-diode, a pinhole, a 3D-printed housing consisting of 3 parts and a single-board portable computer and camera with an open-source implementation of the Fresnel-Kirchhoff routine. We demonstrate 1.55 μm spatial resolution by laser-pickup and 3.91 μm by the light-emitting-diode source. The housing and mechanical components are 3D printed. Both printer and reconstruction software source codes are open. The light-weight microscope allows to image label-free micro-spheres of 6.5 μm diameter, human red-blood-cells of about 8 μm diameter as well as fast-growing plant Nicotiana-tabacum-BY-2 suspension cells with 50 μm sizes. The imaging capability is validated by imaging-contrast quantification involving a standardized test target. The presented 3D-printable portable open-source platform represents a fully-open design, low-cost modular and versatile imaging-solution for use in high- and low-resource areas of the world.

AB  - In the era of technological advances and innovations in transportation technologies, application of driving simulators for the investigation and assessment of the driving process provides a safe and suitable testing environment. Although driving simulators are crucial for further improvements in transportation, it is important to resolve one of their main disadvantages–simulator sickness. Therefore, suitable methods for the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity–electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are growing simultaneously. These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO2 and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user’s state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via ‘HTTP requests’ for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO2 and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001% which proves its applicability in healthcare. © 2019 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.

AB  - Embedded system today are influencing every sphere of life and all application domains. These systems were initially designed according to the application requirement as special hardware. This approach of embedded system design was influenced by particular family of processor. The new approach of embedded system design envisages the use of general purpose on the shelf hardware modules to be incorporated. These on the shelf hardware modules are also referred open source hardware platforms as their entire hardware module design in available in public domain. Thus populating such hardware platforms by different individuals becomes easy. At instances these open source modules are not as good as the original ones. This is because calculating and predicting the successes achieved or failure caused by the copy is not tested. This can be verified by the performance of the module designed in terms of reliability. © BEIESP.

AB  - Optogenetic probes can be powerful tools for dissecting complexity in cell biology, but there is a lack of instrumentation to exploit their potential for automated, high-information-content experiments. This protocol describes the construction and use of the optoPlate-96, a platform for high-throughput three-color optogenetics experiments that allows simultaneous manipulation of common red- and blue-light-sensitive optogenetic probes. The optoPlate-96 enables illumination of individual wells in 96-well microwell plates or in groups of wells in 384-well plates. Its design ensures that there will be no cross-illumination between microwells in 96-well plates, and an active cooling system minimizes sample heating during light-intensive experiments. This protocol details the steps to assemble, test, and use the optoPlate-96. The device can be fully assembled without specialized equipment beyond a 3D printer and a laser cutter, starting from open-source design files and commercially available components. We then describe how to perform a typical optogenetics experiment using the optoPlate-96 to stimulate adherent mammalian cells. Although optoPlate-96 experiments are compatible with any plate-based readout, we describe analysis using quantitative single-cell immunofluorescence. This workflow thus allows complex optogenetics experiments (independent control of stimulation colors, intensity, dynamics, and time points) with high-dimensional outputs at single-cell resolution. Starting from 3D-printed and laser-cut components, assembly and testing of the optoPlate-96 can be accomplished in 3–4 h, at a cost of ~$600. A full optoPlate-96 experiment with immunofluorescence analysis can be performed within ~24 h, but this estimate is variable depending on the cell type and experimental parameters. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Background and Objective: Sodium divalproate is an effective neuromodulator for migraine prevention. Recommended doses vary from 1,000 to 1,500 mg/day, which may provoke unpleasant side effects as weight gain, tremor, and hair loss. Some patients do respond to lower doses even used once daily in ER presentations, but alternating low daily doses was never studied so far. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence, the tolerability, and the efficacy of sodium divalproate (SD) in low alternating daily doses for migraine prevention in patients of a tertiary center. Methods: Consecutive migraineurs from a tertiary center to whom SD was prescribed as monotherapy from January 2017 until September 2018 were studied retrospectively. The doses were 250 mg alternated with 500 mg and were used based on the treating physician expertise and previous experience with tolerability issues when using higher doses. Headache frequency compared to baseline, adherence expressed by returning to a visit after 2 and 4 months and side effects reported by the patients, were evaluated. Results: Sixty-eight patients (53 women and 15 men, aged 18-58) were included. The average headache frequency (HF) during baseline was decreased from 8.2 to 5.1 headache days/month among the 50 out of 68 patients returning at 2 months (adherence rate 73.5%). Weight gain was reported by 15 patients (30%, mean 2.1 kg). At 4 months, HF was reduced to 4.2 days/month (adherence rate 61.8%, n = 42) and weight gain reported by 18 patients (42.8%, mean 2.3 kg). Conclusions: Despite the retrospective open design, which cannot allow definitive conclusions, SD in low alternating daily doses seems to be effective as with higher doses, but still induce modest weight gain. Controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations. © 2019 American Headache Society

AB  - In Earth science, we must often collect data from sensors installed in remote locations. Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY’s Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries’ open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer. © 2019 DeBell, Goertzen, Larson, Selbie, Selker and Udell.

AB  - Mobile robots are playing a significant role in Higher Education science and engineering teaching, as they offer a flexible platform to explore and teach a wide-range of topics such as mechanics, electronics and software. Unfortunately the widespread adoption is limited by their high cost and the complexity of user interfaces and programming tools. To overcome these issues, a new affordable, adaptable and easy-to-use robotic platform is proposed. Mona is a low-cost, open-source and open-hardware mobile robot, which has been developed to be compatible with a number of standard programming environments. The robot has been successfully used for both education and research at The University of Manchester, UK. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - We present the developmental considerations, design, and deployment of an autonomous modular terrestrial rover for ice-sheet exploration that is inexpensive, easy to construct, and allows for instrumentation customization. The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD&thinsp;3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory platform that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs) have shown promising potential in mobile 3-dimensional grasping applications, but they still suffer from some difficulties impeding their board applications, such as target detection and indoor positioning. For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation tasks. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In recent years, frugal products of the grassroots and advanced types are being widely used due to their sustainable nature and also affordability. However, despite the origins of frugality at grassroots level, grassroots innovations continue to be fabricated in an ad hoc manner that precludes application of science and are thus susceptible to premature failure. This work advocates the use of scientific principles for developing frugal products in general with emphasis on classical and new design methodologies that are rooted in science to save resources, and hence lower costs, while aiming for robust product functionality. This paper sheds light on the importance of the safety factor in frugal designs and the need, from here onwards, of a factor of frugality for the systematic realization of both grassroots and advanced frugal products. In particular, adoption of the factor of frugality, that was developed recently, has been supported in this effort with a numerical example to display the effectiveness of applying science for designing from scratch frugal products that are both streamlined and robust in their functionality. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - After almost a century of use and development, operant chambers remain a significant financial investment for scientists. Small powerful single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi™ offer researchers a low-cost alternative to expensive operant chambers. In this paper, we describe two new operant chambers, one using nose-poke ports as operanda and another using a touchscreen. To validate the chamber designs, rats learned to perform both visual discrimination and delayed alternation tasks in each chamber. Designs and codes are open source and serve as a starting point for researchers to develop behavioral experiments or educational demonstrations. © 2019 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior

AB  - European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots is an outdoor robotics contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater, and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks ~83% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored with the Creativity Award “for building a land robot from scratch in less than 2 days when their ground platform broke.”. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Cognitive deficits (CDs) in schizophrenia affect poor outcome and real-world community functioning. Because redox imbalance has been implicated, among other factors, in the pathophysiology of CDs, antioxidant compounds may have a beneficial effect in their treatment. Red yeast rice (RYR), besides its lipid-lowering effect, exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Methods Thirty-five schizophrenia outpatients (age range, 18-60 years) on stable antipsychotic treatment and assessed by neuropsychological (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST], Verbal Fluency, and Stroop task) and psychodiagnostic instruments (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) received RYR at daily dosage of 200 mg/d (total monacolin K/capsule content, 11.88 mg) for 12 weeks. Results Red yeast rice supplementation significantly improved WCST "perseverative errors" (P = 0.015), "total errors" (P = 0.017, P = 0.001), and phonemic fluency test (P = 0.008); a trend for improvement on other WCST variables ("nonperseverative errors," "perseverative responses," and "categories") was observed. Effect sizes, according to Cohen's suggestions, were small in all explored cognitive dimensions. There were no significant change in clinical symptoms and no subject-reported adverse effects. Conclusions Despite several limitations (open design, lack of a control group, short period of observation, small sample size, mode of controlling patients' compliance, the lack of assessment of patients' functional improvement), results suggest that RYR supplementation may be a potentially promising strategy for addressing CDs in schizophrenia; further randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to better evaluate the potential role of RYR for the treatment of CDs in schizophrenia. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Droplet microfluidics generally employed syringe pumps to infuse fluids into microchannels that created unavoidable interface fluctuation during emulsification. They also caused droplet differentiation among different batches due to the reloading of syringes. We herein reported a new gravity-driven approach to supply a steady pressure input on the microchannels and continuous liquid supplement due to the semi-open design. This microfluidic system combined by several overflow units could effectively reduce the disturbance on the multiphase interface, and single emulsions with high monodispersity could be continuously generated. By changing the overflow height, different sizes of single emulsions could be obtained. In addition, double emulsions could also be realized by simply adding another unit without effecting further changes in the system. These features indicated that the gravity-driven overflow microfluidic system could infuse fluids steadily and continuously, and could widely contribute to fields requiring less manual power. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A low-cost open-source wideband current sensor, measuring currents in a frequency range from DC to 5 MHz, is proposed. The sensor provides galvanic isolation, low insertion impedance, and can be used together with an oscilloscope as replacement for an expensive current probe, or as circuit integrated sensor, to measure currents with peak values up to 20 A. The hardware of the sensor consists of standard parts soldered on a printed circuit board; no special custom parts and/or manufacturing steps are needed to build. Applications are general measurement and laboratory use, e.g. measuring current waveforms in lab experiments. But the sensor can also be integrated in control circuits requiring measurements of time varying currents, e.g. for high speed current mode control in power electronics. © 2019 The Author

AB  - Presented here is a new bench-top research device for the measurement of the optical turbidity of natural sediment-laden water samples. This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0–5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable. A new methodology, described here, facilitates the cross-comparability of turbidity measurements. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Understanding what drives user loyalty is a central theme in the research fields of open design community (ODC) and sustained innovation. Drawing on theories of network externalities and expectation disconfirmation, this paper develops a theoretical model reflecting the effect of determinants on user loyalty. The model is tested utilizing survey data amassed from 389 users of a typical ODC, Xiaomi Corporation's forum, in China. The major findings of our work as follows: First, satisfaction plays the most important role in explaining the user loyalty to ODCs, and disconfirmation of fan care is the most critical factor influencing user satisfaction. Second, the perceived network size exerts negative impact on user loyalty to an ODC. Third, impacts of different factors on user loyalty vary due to gender difference. This research advanced the knowledge in Open Design by demonstrating the antecedents of participant's loyalty towards ODC, and highlighting the motivations of individual's open design participation behavior. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents an open source framework called Creamino. It consists of an Arduino-based cost-effective quick-setup EEG platform built with off-the-shelf components and a set of software modules that easily allow users to connect this system to Simulink or BCI-oriented tools (such as BCI2000 or OpenViBE) and set up a wide number of neuroscientific experiments. Creamino is capable of processing multiple EEG channels in real-time and operates under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X in real-time on a standard PC. Its objective is to provide a system that can be readily fabricated and used for neurophysiological experiments and, at the same time, can serve as the basis for development of novel BCI platforms by accessing and modifying its open source hardware and software libraries. Schematics, gerber files, bill of materials, source code, software modules, demonstration videos, and instructions on how to use these modules are available free of charge for research and educational purposes online at https://github.com/ArcesUnibo/creamino. Application cases show how the system can be used for neuroscientific or BCI experiments. Thanks to its low production cost and its compatibility with open-source BCI tools, the system presented is particularly suitable for use in BCI research and educational applications. © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization is one of the most promising approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave’s DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Currently, intelligent solutions that integrate lighting systems, security and automated environments give rise to new ways to optimize resources; and in this way facilitate everyday tasks in order to improve the quality of life. This study is based on a technical analysis of automated lighting systems, where the programmable mechanisms for different fixed actions in a specific time or even react in a certain way to a stimulus or external signal, thanks to specific sensors. Said actions were embodied in the design and construction stage of a microelectronic control panel with human machine interface and equipped with wireless communication to a mobile application, all based on free hardware. It is important to mention that prior to the development of the application, a diagnostic analysis of the physical space situation to intervene, was carried out. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - In this work, a new approach for Sun tracking systems is presented. Due to the current system limitations regarding costs and operational problems, a new approach based on low cost, computer vision open hardware and deep learning has been developed. The preliminary tests carried out successfully in Plataforma solar de Almería (PSA), reveal the great potential and show the new approach as a good alternative to traditional systems. The proposed approach can provide key variables for the Sun tracking system control like cloud movements prediction, block and shadow detection, atmospheric attenuation or measures of concentrated solar radiation, which can improve the control strategies of the system and therefore the system performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Food production in conventional agriculture faces numerous challenges such as reducing waste, meeting demand, maintaining flavor, and providing nutrition. Contained environments under artificial climate control, or cyber-agriculture, could in principle be used to meet many of these challenges. Through such environments, phenotypic expression of the plant—mass, edible yield, flavor, and nutrients—can be actuated through a “climate recipe,” where light, water, nutrients, temperature, and other climate and ecological variables are optimized to achieve a desired result. This paper describes a method for doing this optimization for the desired result of flavor by combining cyber-agriculture, metabolomic phenotype (chemotype) measurements, and machine learning. In a pilot experiment, (1) environmental conditions, i.e. photoperiod and ultraviolet (UV) light (known to affect production of flavor-active molecules in edible plants) were applied under different regimes to basil plants (Ocimum basilicum) growing inside a hydroponic farm with an open-source design; (2) flavor-active volatile molecules were measured in each plant using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); and (3) symbolic regression was used to construct a surrogate model of this chemistry from the input environmental variables, and this model was used to discover new combinations of photoperiod and UV light to increase this chemistry. These new combinations, or climate recipes, were then implemented in the hydroponic farm, and several of them resulted in a marked increase in volatiles over control. The process also led to two important insights: it demonstrated a “dilution effect”, i.e. a negative correlation between weight and desirable chemical species, and it discovered the surprising effect that a 24-hour photoperiod of photosynthetic-active radiation, the equivalent of all-day light, induces the most flavor molecule production in basil. In this manner, surrogate optimization through machine learning can be used to discover effective recipes for cyber-agriculture that would be difficult and time-consuming to find using hand-designed experiments. © 2019 Johnson et al.

AB  - This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development. Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers’ community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce. Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for specific monitoring applications and working environments. © IWA Publishing 2019.

AB  - Operant conditioning is a crucial tool in neuroscience research for probing brain function. While molecular, anatomical and even physiological techniques have seen radical increases in throughput, efficiency, and reproducibility in recent years, behavioural tools have somewhat lagged behind. Here we present a fully automated, high-throughput system for self-initiated conditioning of up to 25 group-housed, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagged mice over periods of several months and &gt;10 6 trials. We validate this “AutonoMouse” system in a series of olfactory behavioural tasks and show that acquired data is comparable to previous semi-manual approaches. Furthermore, we use AutonoMouse to systematically probe the impact of graded olfactory bulb lesions on olfactory behaviour, demonstrating that while odour discrimination in general is robust to even most extensive disruptions, small olfactory bulb lesions already impair odour detection. Discrimination learning of similar mixtures as well as learning speed are in turn reliably impacted by medium lesion sizes. The modular nature and open-source design of AutonoMouse should allow for similar robust and systematic assessments across neuroscience research areas. © 2019 Erskine et al.

AB  - This text is an ethnographic account of a singular, Barcelona-based activist endeavour called En torno a la silla (ETS): a do-it-yourself and open design and making collective engaging in a very peculiar form of accessibility politics beyond a ‘disability rights’ framework. In it, I entangle intimately with ETS’s relational interventions, in the form of making and documentation processes. What animates me is a political engagement with the practice of ‘re-description’, paying attention to the singularity of what relational vocabularies and practices bring to the fore. In describing the context of its appearance, as well as several of the collective’s endeavours, I address ETS’s relational register. Rather than being a clear-cut activist group with the aim of materialising the ‘inclusion’ of ‘disabled people’ through ‘technical aids’, ETS engaged in producing what they called ‘technologies of friendship’: frail and careful material explorations opening up interstitial relational spaces of ‘mutual access’ between bodily diverse people. Through circulating tutorials, poetic accounts, digitally and in workshops and presentations, ETS’s technologies of friendship became also ways of addressing how relations can be materialised and reflexively described, making available in its wake ways to re-enact them. Thus it produced an inspiring ‘how to’ accessibility politics: a material-political concern with the speculative opening up and materialisation of conditions for the very happening of relations, relating at the hinges of unrelatability. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Soil columns have been utilized in hydrology to study vertical solute transfer through porous material for decades. Soil columns are typically designed as open tubes with soil held in place with meshing. While this open design is sufficient for non-hazardous particles, it is not ideal for hazardous biological contaminants that may be harmful to humans. The design of this study features a closed soil column system for use with potentially hazardous biological components. The apparatus is comprised of a mist nozzle, flow-reducing cap, and meshing to simulate rainfall on each soil column. After percolating through the soil, water and contaminants pass through a funnel coupling and discharge tube into a collection container. For additional safety, the soil column design fits within a standard biosafety cabinet for use with hazardous contaminants. Its modular design allows for simple maintenance, water flowrate adjustment, and versatility that encourages use in multiple applications. These soil columns were created to study the vertical flow of pathogens, pesticides, and other biological agents. Further experimentation with various hazardous components will develop a better understanding of their fate and transport in soil. This paper details the construction processes and testing methods to validate the system’s ability to replicate a desired flowrate, which is a precursor to studying the vertical transport of pathogens and other agents through soil. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article presents an innovative and low-cost solution for optimizing the acquisition of performance data of small-laboratory-scale photovoltaic devices. A novel measuring setup is proposed, designed based on an Arduino microcontroller and low-cost components, coupled with open source hardware and software. The manuscript describes in detail the instrument design, components and assembly enabling the reproduction and customization of the instrument for any reader. The setup is combined with an optional web-platform, which enables fast analysis and comparison of the collected data. For the demonstration of the instrument in operation, comparison of measurements of solar cell with the developed setup and commercial products has been conducted. It is shown that the presented prototype provides values of accuracy and precision during I-V curve recording, comparable with the values measured using a commercial source-meter (Keithley 2400). The study also discusses the unique advantages of easy transport and data collection by the setup and the drawbacks in the hardware, which have been observed during a round robin study. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss emerging practices in open evaluation, namely, the concept of co-evaluation and how research on evaluation developed within information science can contribute to enhance stakeholders and citizens’ involvement in open science. Design/methodology/approach: A meta-evaluative and transdisciplinary approach – directed toward the intersection between information science, evaluation, competences management, sustainability transitions management and participatory methodologies – provided the basis for the identification and subsequent reflection on the levels of stakeholder participation embedded into ISO 16439’s (2014) methods for assessing the impact of libraries and on the domains and competences to be mobilized for (co)evaluation. The contributions of Engaged 2020 Action Catalogue, as well as several taxonomies of evaluator competences and the Council of Europe’s (2016) conceptual model of competences for a democratic culture were particularly relevant for this (re)construction process. Findings: Two results of the line of research carried out since 2012 at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (Portugal) can significantly contribute to improve stakeholders’ participation in Open Science: ISO 16439’s systematization of methods and procedures for assessing the impact of libraries and the (co-)evaluation competency framework. Originality/value: This paper presents the transdisciplinary concept of co-evaluation and examines the current epistemological challenges to science by analyzing the general tendency to openness through the lens of research on evaluation and participatory methods developed within information science. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - An important challenge for our society is the transformation of traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - IoT is much more than a large number of objects or customer devices connected to the Internet. IoT offers organizations many more opportunities than they can imagine. According to this, sooner or later they will probably choose to build their own IoT network. In this article, we review the technologies of IoT LPWAN Sigfox and LoRa. It can be considered the most important at present due to its ability to make the smart city possible. We also propose the development, deployment and implementation of a mixed IoT architecture LoRa-Sigfox composed of components based on open hardware and software. The architecture is evaluated in a real environment focused on remote monitoring of water meter devices. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nowadays, global engineers need to be equipped with professional skills and knowledge to solve 21st century problems. The educational program, created in digital learning rooms of the Higher Engineering Education Alliance Program (HEEAP) program supported by Arizona State University, became a pioneer in teaching learners to work within the community. First, the combination of a novel instructional strategy and an integrated education in which project-based approach is employed to apply the technical knowledge. During this, students in mechatronics, computer science, and mechanics must collaborate with peers from industrial systems engineering. Second, in this paper, the design of an open structure connecting multi-disciplinary major is illustrated with a new teaching approach. It is proved to be better by combining specialized understandings of various types in a wide range of applications. From this basis support, participants could implement additional components quickly while keeping the cost low, making the products feasible and user-friendly. Last but not least, students are facilitated with a free library that helps to control simply despite lacking experience in robotics or automation. Several examples show that students are capable of developing things by themselves on open design. In brief, this platform might be an excellent tool to teach and visualize the practical scenario in a multi-disciplinary field. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microphysiological systems hold the promise to increase the predictive and translational power of in vitro substance testing owing to their faithful recapitulation of human physiology. However, the implementation of academic developments in industrial settings remains challenging. We present an injection-molded microfluidic microtissue (MT) culture chip that features two channels with 10 MT compartments each and that was designed in compliance with microtiter plate standard formats. Polystyrene as a chip material enables reliable, large-scale production and precise control over experimental conditions due to low adsorption or absorption of small, hydrophobic molecules at or into the plastic material in comparison with predecessor chips made of polydimethylsiloxane. The chip is operated by tilting, which actuates gravity-driven flow between reservoirs at both ends of every channel, so that the system does not require external tubing or pumps. The flow rate can be modulated by adjusting the tilting angle on demand. The top-open design of the MT compartment enables efficient MT loading using standard or advanced pipetting equipment, ensures oxygen availability in the chip, and allows for high-resolution imaging. Every channel can be loaded with up to 10 identical or different MTs, as demonstrated by culturing liver and tumor MTs in the same medium channel on the chip. © 2018 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - Background: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil. New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil. Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination. Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals. © 2018

AB  - Combining fluorescence and transmitted light sources for microscopy is an invaluable method in cellular neuroscience to probe the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cells. This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with µManager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca 2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take ∼1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed. © 2019 Battefeld, Popovic, van der Werf and Kole.

AB  - This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on ‘open design’ in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including ‘open hardware’): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself ‘making,’ manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software, and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces’ social media presence serve as the ‘front door’ for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different ‘front doors’ of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces’ social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and differences between makerspaces’ social media presences in the same geographical region have the strength of producing different identities across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential participation in Open Design. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - An automated method based on open-source hardware was created for the separation of porphyrins fractions from crude oil, an essential step for the quantification of V and Ni as metalloporphyrins. Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V). The overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults worldwide. Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost, among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes open-source hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator (PACoGen) for the recently developed universal number posit number system, along with a set of pipelined architectures. The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length 'regime-bit' and 'exponent-bit' (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Some people with severe disabilities are confined in a state in which communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts into words. The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Microplate (i.e. microwell plate) is a flat plate that has a specific number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies. In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Vector similarity searching consists of comparing a query vector against a high volume of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-norm, or Hamming distance. Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and research in this area. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In power generation systems the synchronization of an alternator with the electrical network are an important and critical task. This paper presents the design and building of an automatic three-phase alternator synchronizer based on a low-cost open-hardware Arduino platform. The synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive. The design and practical implementation of the system is proposed as a project-based learning (PBL) activity for undergraduate final year students at the University of Bío-Bío, Chile. A description of the constructed prototype and the results obtained are presented and discussed. © 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of an open hardware–software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also support the suitability of the proposed platform. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - What is ‘open design’ and who gets to say what it is? In the emerging body of literature on open design, there is a clear alignment to the values and practices of free culture and open source software and hardware. Yet this same literature includes multiple, sometimes even contradictory strands of technology practice and research. These different perspectives can be traced back to free culture advocates from the 1970s to the 1990s who formulated the ideal of the internet as inherently empowering, democratizing, and countercultural. However, more recent approaches include feminist and critical interventions into hacking and making as well as corporate strategies of “open innovation” that bring end-users and consumers into the design process. What remains today seems to fall into two schools of thought. On one hand, we have the celebratory endorsements of ‘openness’ as applied to technology and design. On the other hand, we have a continuous and expanding critique of these very ideals and questions, where that critique identifies persisting forms of racial, gender, age, and class-based exclusions, and questions about the relationship between open design, labor and power remain largely unanswered. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The study of two- dimensional (2D) materials is a rapidly growing area within nanomaterials research. However, the high equipment costs, which include the processing systems necessary for creating these materials, can be a barrier to entry for some researchers interested in studying these novel materials. Such process systems include those used for chemical vapor deposition, a preferred method for making these materials. To address this challenge, this article presents the first open-source design for an automated chemical vapor deposition system that can be built for less than a third of the cost for a comparable commercial system. The materials and directions for the system are divided by subsystems, which allows the system to be easily built, customized and upgraded, depending upon the needs of the user. We include the details for the specific hardware that will be needed, instructions for completing the build, and the software needed to automate the system. With a chemical vapor deposition system built as described, a variety of 2D nanomaterials and their heterostructures can be grown. Specifically, the experimental results clearly demonstrate the capability of this open-source design in producing high quality, 2D nanomaterials such as graphene and tungsten disulfide, which are at the forefront of research in emerging semiconductor devices, sensors, and energy storage applications. © 2019 Williams- Godwin et al.

AB  - Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled home automation and security systems. These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In this paper, we deal with the development of a high speed monitoring system using opensource hardware and MATLAB/Simulink. We use the Arduino Due as opensource hardware. The proposed high speed monitoring system has four features. First, it does not affect the operation of the user application running on a micro-controller. The proposed system performs realtime monitoring using an algorithm that minimizes the computational load. Second, data channels can have different data types and update periods. Consequently, flexible data monitoring is possible. Third, the proposed system uses MATLAB/Simulink for monitoring. As a result, users can utilize all the powerful functions supported by MATLAB to process the monitored data. Finally, the algorithm of the proposed high speed monitoring system can be applied to any micro-controller with serial communication peripheral. Through experiments, we verify the performance of the developed monitoring system. It is shown that the data loss does not happen through the basic experiment. Through realtime monitoring experiment for the sensorless drive system of the BLDC motor, it is illustrated that the proposed system has its strength in high speed monitoring of data changing very fast such as current or back EMF signals. © ICROS 2019.

AB  - In the product design, understanding consumer requirements (CRs) is essential due to the fact that it influences the success of the product. Currently, it has been recognized that consumer involvement in an open design (OD) environment is an effective way to reduce the gap between what is required by consumers and what companies can provide. In the process of OD, the initial CRs may shift as the consumers can influence each other, and it is a challenge to capture and evaluate dynamic CRs in OD. In this study, the dynamic relationship between consumers who participate in OD is discussed based on Nash equilibrium. Corresponding to the dynamic relationship, a novel approach is proposed to explore the crucial CRs from consumers’ perspective. Initially, the platform of OD is constructed on the Internet to collect the CRs and its evaluations. Thereafter, a similarity-based filtering method (SFM) is presented to filter out the most differentiated evaluations. Furthermore, to get the weight of the CR evaluated by consumers, an improved fuzzy Delphi method is introduced. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of excessive number of CRs, a dual-index evaluation method is put forward to control the opening degree of OD. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested approach, a product of smartphone is examined as a case study. The results confirm that the proposed approach is appropriate for capturing and evaluating dynamic CRs in OD. © 2018

AB  - Despite the fact that the open-source community around the RISC-V instruction set archi- tecture is growing rapidly, there is still no high-speed open-source hardware implementation of the IEEE 754-2008 oating-point standard available. We designed a Fused Multiply-Add Floating- Point Unit compatible with the RISC-V ISA in SystemVerilog, which enables us to conduct de- tailed optimizations where necessary. The design has been verified with the industry standard simulation-based Universal Verification Methodology using the Specman e Hardware Verification Language. The most challenging part of the verification is the reference model, for which we in- tegrated the Floating-Point Unit of an existing Intel processor using the Function Level Interface provided by Specman e. With the use of Intel's Floating-Point Unit we have a "known good" and fast reference model. The Back-End ow was done with Global Foundries' 22 nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (GF22FDX) process using Cadence tools. We reached 1.8 GHz over PVT corners with a 0.8 V forward body bias, but there is still a large potential for further RTL opti- mization. A power analysis was conducted with stimuli generated by the verification environment and resulted in 212 mW. © The Authors 2019.

AB  - The visualization toolkit (VTK) is a popular cross-platform, open source toolkit for scientific and medical data visualization, processing, and analysis. It supports a wide variety of data formats, algorithms, and rendering techniques for both polygonal and volumetric data. In particular, VTK's volume rendering module has long provided a comprehensive set of features such as plane clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting, and other controls needed for visualization. However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend and its reliance on a deprecated API, the system did not take advantage of the latest improvements in graphics hardware or the flexibility of a programmable pipeline. Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated pipeline posed restrictions when running on emerging computing platforms, thereby limiting its overall applicability. In response to these shortcomings, the VTK community developed a new and improved volume rendering module, which not only provides a modern graphics processing unit-based implementation, but also augments its capabilities with new features such as fast volume clipping, gradient-magnitude-based opacity modulation, render to texture, and hardware-based volume picking. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a power management framework for solar-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices to maximize the lifetime of the system by adaptively changing performance of the system. Our framework balances the energy consumption and the performance of the IoT system by monitoring energy accumulation and battery, and ensures the minimum level of service. The framework has been implemented in real hardware and software. Experiments with the implemented system shows that our framework can help increase the lifetime of the solar powered IoT system. The framework prevented the IoT device from power down due to the full discharge of the battery at night time, by changing the execution rate based on energy accumulation and battery status. The proposed framework has been implemented using open hardware compatible with Arduino, so it can be used for a wide range of IoT applications and services. © 2018, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

AB  - This paper aims to design a stable, reliable, energy-efficient yet low-cost structural health monitoring (SHM) system for bridges in remote regions. First, the integrated system design was adopted based on the Linux architecture, and the power-efficient opensource hardware was taken as the mini Linux PCs on the bridge site. Next, several sensor subsystems were integrated physically via the Ethernet, while nine core software modules were developed based on opensource software and integrated into a logical whole. The stability of the system was improved through dual PC redundancy and intelligent fault diagnosis. The data collected by sensors were analyzed in real time and only the valid data and alarms were transmitted to the remote monitoring center. In addition, the remote transmission and active control were completed, with the aid of 3G/4G router, VPN and reverse SSH tunneling. In this way, the author developed an easy-to-maintain and cost-efficient SHM system. Finally, the effectiveness of the system was verified through the application in a bridge on an expressway in Yunnan Province, China. The results fully demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and cost effectiveness of the proposed system. This research fills up the gap in Linux-based SHM system design for bridges in remote regions, providing a reliable and advanced reference for the construction of bridge SHM systems. © 2019 Lavoisier.

AB  - Background: Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a crucial life-saving procedure, where more than 2 failed attempts can lead to further complications or even death. Like all technical skills, ETI requires sufficient practice to perform adequately. Currently, the models used to practice ETI are expensive and, therefore, difficult to access, particularly in the developing world and in settings that lack a dedicated simulation center. Objective: This study aimed to improve access to ETI training by creating a comparable yet cost-effective simulation model producible by 3-dimensional (3D) printers. Methods: Open-source mesh files of relevant anatomy from BodyParts3D were modified through the 3D modeling programs Meshlab (ISTI-CNR) and Blender (Blender Foundation). Several prototypes with varying filaments were tried to optimize the ETI simulation. Results: We have created the novel 3D-printed pediatric ETI model for learners at all levels to practice this airway management skill at negligible costs compared with current simulation models. It is an open-source design available for all medical trainees. Conclusions: Revolutions in cost and ease of use have allowed home and even desktop 3D printers to become widespread. Therefore, open-source access to the ETI model will improve accessibility to medical training in the hopes of optimizing patient care. © Lily Park, Steven Price-Williams, Alireza Jalali, Kashif Pirzada.

AB  - Three-dimensional printing is widely celebrated as enabling open design and manufacturing practice. With easy-to-use techniques such as automated modeling, fabrication machines ostensibly help designers turn ideas into fully fledged objects. Prior HCI literature focuses on improving printing through optimization and by developing printer and material capabilities. This paper expands such considerations by asking, how do 3D printing practitioners understand and create “printability?” And how might HCI better support the work that holds together printing workflows and changing ecosystems of materials and techniques? We conducted studies in two sites of open design: a technology firm in Silicon Valley, California and a makerspace in Stockholm, Sweden. Deploying workshops and interviews, we examine how practitioners negotiate the print experience, revealing a contingent process held together by trial and error exploration and careful interventions. These insights point to the value of tools and processes to support articulation work, what Strauss and colleagues have called the acts of fitting together people, tasks, and their ordering to accomplish an overarching project. We show that despite the sought-after efficiencies of such manufacturing, 3D printing entails articulation work, particularly acts of alignment, exposing messy modes of production carried out by a varied cast of practitioners, machines, and materials. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Cars for disabled drivers consist of adapting their functionalities to be operated by hands, in a manner a paraplegic individual should rely only on their hands. This task can become difficult taking into account that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino® and, afterwards, sent to a Raspberry Pi®. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to control automotive functionalities. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of real-time car functionalities control using electromyography and efficient low-cost hardware. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - (Figure Presented) Measuring ingestive behavior of liquids in rodents is commonly used in studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-cage measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications. © 2019 Godynyuk et al.

AB  - More and more the discipline of Design is expected to assume a prominent role as an agent for social transformation in the transition towards a sustainable society. These demands that come from both the academic and the social spheres, and show the need to establish new working synergies with the resilient movements of local communities which pose a fertile scenario emerging from new challenges for the pedagogy of design. On the other hand, from a methodological point of view the fitting with these movements of social resilience requires an open and participatory design process, that must include communities in a horizontal decisionmaking system, and at the same time offer open design solutions that can grow and adapt following the evolution of the changing needs of these communities. Within these premises, the case of a communications design project carried out in collaboration between a group of design students of Escola Superior de Disseny i Arts Plàstiques and the self-managed collective that dynamizes the project of urban agriculture and organic community named Espai Quiró in the neighborhood of la Salut (Barcelona) will be studied. Both the work of the community managing the space and the intervention of the students participating in this pedagogical experience, responded to a model of design committed to citizenship and neighborhood associations, led by citizens themselves, that overcame the dominant models of behavior and participated in the idea of transition to a new alternative way of living in the cities: with a more unhurried and sustainable rhythm of life advocating collaborative work and empowerment of the associative network of the neighborhood and a re-appropriation of public space by local communities. © 2019 Universidad de Caldas.

AB  - Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing. © 2019, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

AB  - Optical imaging of wholemount tissue samples provides greater understanding of structure–function relationships as the architecture of these specimens is generally well preserved. However, difficulties arise when attempting to stitch together images of multiple regions of larger, oddly shaped specimens. These difficulties include (1) maintaining consistent signal-to-noise ratios when the overlying sample surface is uneven, (2) ensuring sample viability when live samples are required, and (3) stabilizing the specimen in a fixed position in a flowing medium without distorting the tissue sample. To address these problems, we designed a simple and cost-efficient device that can be 3D-printed and machined. The design for the device, named the Platform for Planar Imaging of Curved Surfaces (PICS), consists of a sample holder, or “cap” with gaps for fluid flow and a depression for securing the sample in a fixed position without glue or pins, a basket with two arms that move along an external radius to rotate the sample around a central axis, and a customizable platform designed to fit on a commercially available temperature control system for slice electrophysiology. We tested the system using wholemounts of the murine subventricular zone (SVZ), which has a high degree of curvature, to assess sample viability and image quality through cell movement for over an hour for each sample. Using the PICS system, tissues remained viable throughout the imaging sessions, there were no noticeable decreases in the image SNR across an imaging plane, and there was no noticeable displacement of the specimen due to fluid flow. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Words like palimpsest or heterotopia do not belong to the working vocabulary of materials or engineering sciences: they are used in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). A palimpsest is a manuscript written on an older document, the text of which has been erased. Heterotopia is a young word forged by Michel Foucault in 1967 to describe a closed space, the boundaries of which mark a discontinuity in terms of behavior: a jail or a monastery are thus a heterotopia. The Circular Economy (CE) is an essential concept in the framework of the ecological transition, pulled by a series of converging economic, ecological and political drivers. It is usually described as the adoption of a circular model of production to replace the “linear model”, but also as the new buzzword to describe material efficiency, the 3-R rule, the zero-waste ideal, the concepts of lean or frugal design or their reformulation by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation, as a societal challenge and an ethical necessity. Materials producers claim that they have been practicing the Circular Economy since long before the expression was ever invented, thus à la Monsieur Jourdain, etc. The point of this paper is to describe the Circular Economy as a palimpsest and as a heterotopia and to use the metaphors, if indeed they are only metaphors, to highlight some of the less obvious features of the CE. A palimpsest is a parchment or a papyrus, which is used several times to support a series of consecutive texts. Secondary raw materials are like a palimpsest, because there are retrieved from a previous life and used again in a second life: a new artefact made from that material is like a new text written on/with this material – a metaphor also used, mutatis mutandis, in expressions like 3-D printing or laser scribing. Some interesting features of the CE pointed out by the metaphor: a the palimpsest can be used several times, like a material can be recycled several times; the concept of the palimpsest posits that the parchment is somehow more important than the text that is written on it, therefore a material is more important than the goods that are made of it; the palimpsest was used before the invention of paper and, similarly, the Circular Economy was the standard model before mass production of cheap consumer goods imposed the so-called “linear model”; a palimpsest keeps a fragmented memory of the past, in the same way as recycled material maintains a link to its past lives, through its composition in tramp elements. Examples of heterotopia are a prison or a cemetery. The Circular Economy defines a space where a particular material/element exists in its various avatars, impersonations and reincarnations and this may tentatively be worked out as a heterotopia. This is a more complex endeavor than discussing the palimpsest metaphor, but a potentially more fruitful one. Foucault has provided criteria defining heterotopia which can help us explore the analogy: particularly the point that such a space is either a space of illusion or a space of perfection. This analysis is original because it hybridizes materials and SSH concepts and thus fits with the exploration of the frontier between materials and society that SAM conferences are concerned about. © SCF, 2020.

AB  - Soil displacement is the most important performance indicator for seed openers, as it affects the uniformity of seeding depth. In this study, a hoe opener was modeled using Particle Flow Code in 3 Dimensions (PFC3D), a discrete element modeling software program. The objective was to simulate soil displacement in terms of soil throws. To validate the model, an air drill with hoe openers was tested in a field with clay soil at a working depth of 38 mm and travel speed of 8 km h-1. Soil throw resulting from the hoe opener was measured. To calibrate the model, a virtual soil shear test was created within PFC3D, and the output soil shear torque was compared to the torque measured in the same field. The result showed that the calibrated effective modulus, a critical micro-parameter of model particles, was 5.692 × 107 Pa. With this calibrated value, the simulated soil throws agreed well with the measured throws, with a relative error of 15%. The model was used to compare different hoe opener designs: Single-shoot spread, double-shoot side-band, double-shoot paired-row, and tripleshoot openers. Among all these openers, the side-band opener resulted in the least lateral soil throw, and the paired-row opener resulted in the lowest vertical soil throw but the highest lateral throw. The developed model was effective for examining the effects of opener geometry on soil displacement. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose/Background Newer-generation antidepressants used in monotherapy or in combination with other newer-generation antidepressants or other psychotropic drugs are usually preferred as first-or second-step treatment options in resistant depression. According to our clinical experience, tricyclic antidepressants still are one of our preferred first choices in treatment-resistant moderate to severe unipolar major depressive episodes. Methods This 10-week open-design randomized study assessed the effectiveness of switching to imipramine (adjusted to plasma levels) compared with add-on mirtazapine (30 mg/d) for treatment of moderate to severe unipolar major depressive episodes after a 10-week unsuccessful venlafaxine regimen (225-300 mg/d). Efficacy analyses examined the change in depressive symptoms severity from baseline visit to endpoint and the comparative remission rate between treatment subgroups. Findings/Results The randomized sample consisted of 112 venlafaxine-resistant moderate to severe unipolar major depressed patients. Both the percentage of remitters (71.43% vs 39.28%) and the mean reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (76.94% vs 50.72%) were significantly larger in the imipramine subgroup. Implications/Conclusions Even though we should be cautious about generalizing these results to patients with a less severe unipolar major episodes, our study suggest that switching to imipramine is a very effective treatment option in unipolar major depressive episodes after an unsuccessful venlafaxine regimen. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - In general, warehouses are used to store goods or products. In the Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the products attached to the tags with product information and their respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow. The web page which is built in accordance to provide convenient and an interface to the user to track the products. The developed system results a very low cost system and works dynamically compared with the existing present warehouse inventory management systems. © 2018 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

AB  - Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827° repeatability of 1.585° backlash error of 1.237° maximum speed of 35.156° and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33°. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development. © 2018

AB  - The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today’s society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an "operational pragmatics." Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Opensource and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how "operational pragmatics" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This work describes the development of a peristaltic pump and a photometric detector, using “Arduino” and alternative and low-cost materials for flow analysis system. The analytical calibration curve of the acid-red-283 using the proposed system presents 0.9984 and 3.9% as the coefficients of determination and variation, and 1.1 and 3.8 mg L-1 as limits of detection and quantification, respectively. Three prepared samples of the acid-red-283 (25, 30 and 35 mg L-1) showed recovery between 99 to 104%. For construction of the peristaltic pump and the photometer using Light Emitting Diodes (LED), light-dependent resistor (LDR) were spent less than 10% of the cost was spent on a commercial system employing a peristaltic pump and a spectrophotometer. Furthermore, the peristaltic pump and the photometer developed in this work allow the implementation of practical disciplines, such as molecular absorption spectrophotometry and flow analysis system in undergraduate courses, making these instruments more accessible, especially for the chemistry students. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Agricultural research involves study of the complex soil–plant–atmosphere–water system, and data relating to this system must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts. © 2018 by the authors

AB  - Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an all-in-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 × 31 × 26 cm 3 ), light (&lt;3 kg), and affordable (€810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one open-source system were made freely available at https://github.com/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Despite a growing consensus that 3D printing technology has emerged as a revolutionary driver of innovation in society and has grown exponentially as an innovation ecosystem, our understanding of how the 3D printing ecosystem emerged and has grown is still limited. Based on the case study and the grounded theory approach, we found that four relevant platforms—open-source hardware platforms, online service platforms, free and low-cost 3D design software platforms, and crowdsourcing platforms—nurtured the innovation ecosystem. We also found that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently, we newly suggest “complementary multiplatforms,” a platform strategy that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. Our findings provide important theoretical grounds for the multiplatform strategy with complementary relationships aimed at facilitating the growth of an innovation ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To study the role of temperature in biological systems, diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (λ/4) stubs. Methods: The λ/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of −35.7dB/−41.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was −0.41dB/−0.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases.

AB  - The ability to measure partial pressures of oxygen below 100 microbars and nanomolar dissolved oxygen concentrations in in situ laboratory systems benefits many fields including microbiology, geobiology, oceanography, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present an easily constructible open-source design for a networked luminescence lifetime measurement system for in situ measurements in arbitrary laboratory containers. The system is well suited for measuring oxygen partial pressures in the 0-100 ubar range, with the maximum potentially usable upper range limit at around 10 mbar, depending on experimental conditions. The sensor has a limited drift and its detectability limit for oxygen is at 0.02 ubar for short timescale measurements. Each sensor can connect to a Wi-Fi network and send the logged data either over the Internet or to a local server, enabling a large number of parallel unattended experiments. Designs are also provided for attaching the sensor to various commercially available containers used in laboratories. The design files are released under an open source license, which enables other laboratories to build, customize, and use these sensors. © 2018 Pajusalu et al.

AB  - Design problems are often presented as structured briefs with detailed constraints and requirements, suggesting a fixed definition. However, past studies have identified the importance of exploring design problems for creative design outcomes. Previous protocol studies of designers has shown that problems can co-evolve with the development of solutions during the design process. But to date, little evidence has been provided about how designers systematically explore presented problems to create better solutions. In this study, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 252 design problems collected from publically available sources, including award-winning product designs and open-source design competitions. This database offers an independent sample of presented problems, designers' alternative problem descriptions, and innovative solutions. We report the results of this large-scale qualitative analysis aimed at characterizing changes to problems during the design process. Inductive coding was used to identify content patterns in discovered problem descriptions, with qualitative codes reliably scored by two independent coders. A total of 32 distinct patterns of problem exploration were identified across designers and presented problems. Each pattern is described in the form of a generalized strategy to guide designers as they explore problem spaces. The exploration patterns identified in this study are the first empirical evidence of problem exploration in independent design problems. Further, the presence of exploration patterns in discovered problems is associated with the selection of the corresponding solution as a challenge finalist. These empirically identified strategies for problem exploration may be useful for computational tools supporting designers.

AB  - The use of millirobots, particularly in swarm studies, would enable researchers to verify their proposed autonomous cooperative behavior algorithms under realistic conditions with a large number of agents. While multiple designs for such robots have been proposed, they, typically, require custom-made components, which make replication and manufacturing difficult, and, mostly, employ non-modular integral designs. Furthermore, these robots' proposed small sizes tend to limit sensory perception capabilities and operational time. Some have resolved few of the above issues through the use of extensions that, unfortunately, add to their size. In contribution to the pertinent field, thus, a novel millirobot with an open-source design, addressing the above concerns, is presented in this paper. Our proposed millirobot has a modular design and uses easy to source, off-the-shelf components. The milli-robot-Toronto (mROBerTO) also includes a variety of sensors and has a 16 × 16 mm2 footprint. mROBerTO's wireless communication capabilities include ANT™, Bluetooth Smart, or both simultaneously. Data-processing is handled by an ARM processor with 256 KB of flash memory. Additionally, the sensing modules allow for extending or changing the robot's perception capabilities without adding to the robot's size. For example, the swarm-sensing module, designed to facilitate swarm studies, allows for measuring proximity and bearing to neighboring robots and performing local communications. Extensive experiments, some of which are presented herein, have illustrated the capability of mROBerTO units for use in implementing a variety of commonly proposed swarm algorithms.

AB  - Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents will be available on www.BiosignalPI.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The solar energy conversion into electricity is a very promising technique, knowing that the source is free, clean and abundant in several countries. However, the effect of the solar cells temperature on the photovoltaic panel performance and lifespan remains one of the major disadvantages of this technology. In this work, we present an experimental study of a particular photovoltaic panel. It is self-cooled due to its open design which facilitates natural ventilation helping to improve its performance mainly in hot hours of the day and to avoid dust accumulation on its surface. This solar system is tested for two soil natures, white and gray, and for two inclination angles, 0∘ and 30°. Results show that the photovoltaic panel performs better when it is inclined and placed on a white soil. A 3D CFD model describing the performance of this solar system is then developed and a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data is found. Similarly, this CFD model was used to compare the thermal performance of this solar system to that of the flat PV system and to show that its lower temperature allows better electrical production. © 2018

AB  - Collectives gather online around challenges they face, but frequently fail to envision shared outcomes to act on together. Prior work has developed systems for improving collective ideation and design by exposing people to each others’ ideas and encouraging them to intermix those ideas. However, organizational behavior research has demonstrated that intermixing ideas does not result in meaningful engagement with those ideas. In this paper, we introduce a new class of collective design system that intermixes people instead of ideas: instead of receiving mere exposure to others’ ideas, participants engage deeply with other members of the collective who represent those ideas, increasing engagement and influence. We thus present Hive: a system that organizes a collective into small teams, then intermixes people by rotating team membership over time. At a technical level, Hive must balance two competing forces: (1) networks are better at connecting diverse perspectives when network efficiency is high, but (2) moving people diminishes tie strength within teams. Hive balances these two needs through network rotation: an optimization algorithm that computes who should move where, and when. A controlled study compared network rotation to alternative rotation systems which maximize only tie strength or network efficiency, finding that network rotation produced higher-rated proposals. Hive has been deployed by Mozilla for a real-world open design drive to improve Firefox accessibility. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Background: Guided implant surgery appears to have several benefits, such as the possibility of inserting flapless implants in a prosthetically driven manner, avoiding dangerous anatomical structures. However, to date, only a few surgeons routinely use guided surgery in partially edentulous patients. Aim: To present the results obtained with tooth-supported surgical templates characterized by an innovative open design with selective support, and manufactured via a full in-office procedure with a low-cost desktop 3D printer. Methods: Over a two-year period (2016–2018), all partially edentulous patients with one to three missing teeth (in maxilla and/or mandible), referred to a private dental practice for restoration with dental implants, were considered for inclusion in this prospective clinical study. An intraoral scanner (CS 3600®, Carestream Dental) and cone beam computed tomography (CS 9300®, Carestream Dental) were used to acquire the 3D information on the patients. Guided surgery software (SMOP®, Swissmeda) was used to plan the surgeries and to design open, selective, tooth-supported templates that were fabricated with a stereolithographic (SLA) desktop 3D printer (XFAB2000®, DWS). Guided implant surgeries were performed and patients were followed for a period of one year. The study outcomes were fit and stability of surgical templates, duration (time) of surgery, intra and post-operative complications, and implant stability and survival. Results: Twenty (20) partially edentulous patients (9 males, 11 females; mean age 54.4 ± 9.4 years) were included in the study; 28 open, selective, tooth-supported templates were designed with the aim of inserting 38 implants. Among the surgical templates, 24 had optimal fit and stability, three had optimal fit and sufficient stability, and only one had inadequate fit and unsatisfactory stability and was therefore not suitable for clinical use. The average time of the intervention was 15.7 ± 5.2 min per template. No intra-operative complications were reported, but one implant was not stable at placement and had to be removed. In total, 36 implants were restored with 10 two-unit fixed partial prostheses and 16 single crowns. All implants were successfully functioning at one year, even if, in two single crowns, minor prosthetic complications (abutment screw loosening) occurred. Conclusions: Full in-office guided surgery with open, selective, tooth-supported templates seem to represent a clinically predictable surgical procedure to restore partially edentulous patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these positive outcomes. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Children with a variety of diagnoses have impairments that limit their arm function. Despite the fact that arm function is important for early learning and activities of daily living, there are few tools to assist movement for these children, and existing devices have challenges related to cost, accessibility, comfort, and aesthetics. In this article, we describe the design process and development of the first garment-based exoskeleton to assist arm movement in young children with movement impairments: the Playskin LiftTM. We outline our design process, which contrasts with the traditional medical model in that it is interdisciplinary, user-centered, and addresses the broad needs of users, rather than device function alone. Then we report the results of field-testing with the initial prototype with respect to our design metrics on a toddler with significant bilateral arm movement impairments. Finally, we summarize our ongoing development aimed at increasing comfort, aesthetics, and accessibility of the garment. The interdisciplinary, user-centered approach to assistive technology design presented here can result in innovative and impactful design solutions that translate to the real world. © 2018, © 2018 RESNA.

AB  - An important goal of structured parallel programming has been to provide a design framework that balances between the extent of abstraction built over the hardware and the amount of control given to the programmer to leverage the hardware resource features. Towards this goal, NVIDIA has released an open-source design framework called Thrust based on C++ STL, where the developers can express the functionality in STL style, without having to know the architectural details of the underlying parallel infrastructure. While the framework is generic and portable, it does not support the right abstraction for two-dimensional data, which is heavily used in most of the popular parallel algorithms. In this paper, we proposed Thrust2D, an extension of Thrust to support the abstraction for two-dimensional data, targeted towards structured grid class of applications. We took several structured grid examples from Rodinia benchmark, OpenCV framework, and NVIDIA samples and rewrote them using Thrust2D. We demonstrated that, in some cases, we get nearly 80% reduction in code complexity, and for 12 out of 17 applications we have tested, the kernel performance of Thrust2D versions are well within 85% of the native CUDA versions. When we consider the total execution time, 14 out of 17 Thrust2D versions performance are within 85% of the native CUDA versions. In some cases, the performance of the Thrust2D versions has outperformed the native versions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Many initiatives exist to increase the adoption of open educational practices (OEP) within universities, but few initiatives start by exploring the capacity of educators to adopt open approaches. This paper addresses this challenge, suggesting that in order to build OEP capacity, universities should build on the existing skills of local champions who are familiar with open approaches. The paper builds on the Open Educators’ Factory methodology to map the capacities of university teachers across four areas: open design, open content, open teaching and open assessment and presents the results of its application to a case study within an Italian university. The pilot demonstrates that by using this approach, it is possible to map universities’ existing OEP and connect them with the capability of local educators. This enables university managers to build on the expertise of open education practitioners to raise the overall capacity of their staff to adopt open approaches. © 2018, © 2018 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc.

AB  - In order to assist researchers explore the full potential of distributed recycling of post-consumer polymer waste, this article describes a recyclebot, which is a waste plastic extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing filament. The device design takes advantage of both the open source hardware methodology and the paradigm developed by the open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer community. Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot's ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than $700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24 h. Filament is produced at 0.4 kg/h using 0.24 kWh/kg with a diameter ±4.6%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250 °C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Three types of highly-customizable open source probe positioning systems are evaluated: (a) mostly 3-D printed, (b) partially printed using OpenBeam kinematic constraints, and (c) a 3-level stack of low-cost commercial single axis micropositioners and some printed parts. All systems use digital distributed manufacturing to enable bespoke features, which can be fabricated with RepRap-class 3-D printer and easily accessible components. They are all flexible in material choice for custom components. The micropositioners can be set up for left-right use and flat or recessed configurations using either mechanical or magnetic mounting. All systems use a manual probe holder that can be customized and enable a quick swap probe system. System (a) is purchased for $100 or fabricated for <$5, (b) fabricated for $25, and (c) fabricated for $145. Each full turn of a knob moves an axis 0.8 mm for (a) and 0.5 mm for (b, c) providing externally measured positional control of 10 µm for the latter. All three designs can utilize a customizable probe holder and tungsten carbide needle for $56. The designs are validated using microchips with known feature sizes and underwent mechanical stress tests. The maximal deflection of (a) was >200 µm, (b) 40 µm and (c) 10 µm. A tradeoff is observed for 3-D printed percent between cost and accuracy. All systems provided substantial cost savings over proprietary products with similar functionality. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Locomotor activity in rodents is routinely assessed in the evaluation of drugs and other behavioural studies. Several proprietary lab equipment are available to measure locomotion, however their prohibitive cost may pose a challenge to newly-established and poorly funded labs. To overcome this challenge we present Actifield, an open source hardware setup to measure locomotor activity in rodents. The design consists of 3D printed and laser-cut parts as well as “off-the-shelf” electronic components. Here we demonstrate that rodent locomotor activity can be recorded using the IR motion detection system employed in Actifield. Moreover, we show in validation experiments that this hardware system is comparable to commercial and open source video tracking systems. Actifield would be particularly useful to labs in need of a reliable and inexpensive equipment that can be easily built. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents an easy-to-use, easy-to-customize, and low cost device for remote monitoring of Cultural Heritage environments such as museums, art galleries, and historical archives. The prototype allows measurements of temperature, relative humidity, and dew point. The chip used is an ESP8266 characterized by on-board Wi-Fi. The hardware design is flexible in order to host extra sensors via I2C bus and easy replacement of microcontroller and sensors in the event of either malfunctions or substitution with newer versions. The device is programmable using the Arduino IDE. The data are sent to an IoT platform that allows real-time visualization, analyses, and download. Tests were performed in laboratory and at the Casa de Convalescencia in Vic (Spain), by monitoring the microenvironment of an exhibition cabinet hosting 18th century ceramics. The results achieved are promising: the open hardware and software approach allows plan further implementations and provides a solid base for device customizations; in terms of technology applied to Cultural Heritage, the implementation of open hardware does not only can lower significantly the costs, but also provides scientifically reliable alternatives to off the shelf technology, as well as enhances end-users capability to develop customized devices that can better address specific needs. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Laboratory automation improves test reproducibility, which is vital to patient care in clinical laboratories. Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path length compensations. © 2018 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus is on the “design global, manufacture local” model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a “design global, manufacture local” model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. “Design global, manufacture local” may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents an entirely open-source, low-cost power monitoring system capable of many types of measurements including both loads and supplies such as solar photovoltaic systems. In addition, the system can be fabricated using only open source software and hardware. The design revolves around the Digital Universal Energy Logger (DUEL) Node, which is responsible for reading and properly scaling the voltage and current of a particular load, and then serializing it via an on-board ATTiny85 chip. The configuration of the DUEL node allows for custom sensitivity ranges, and can handle up to 50 A and 300 V. Up to 127 DUEL nodes communicate via Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) on a bus, which can be monitored and logged through an Arduino UNO, or other compatible microcontroller. Using accessible equipment, the DUEL node can be calibrated to a desirable accuracy and error. The DUEL nodes are also completely customizable, making them fit for any input range, where all commercially-available products are fixed range. The open source solution out performs commercial solutions as the price per measurement ($18.25) is significantly smaller, while the number of serviceable channels (1 2 7) is significantly higher. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The expected abolishment of SF6-gas in medium-voltage switchgear has prompted a search for replacements for the switch types that depend on SF6 to obtain the required capability, reliability, compactness, and cost. Ablation of polymers can enhance the arc-quenching capabilities in certain electrical switch designs. Several aspects, like electric arc plasma composition, gas flow, and wall stabilization, must play together to obtain successful interruption. In this paper, open and closed switch geometries and two nozzle materials [polypropylene (PP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)] are studied in medium-voltage interruption experiments. Fundamental differences in the arc-quenching process for PP and PTFE are shown. In the case of PTFE, the current interruption performance depends on gas flow resulting from the pressure built up under the high-current period. In the case of PP, the gas flow plays a lesser role for the arc-quenching capability as the interruption capability is large even in an open design with no forced gas flow around current zero. Current chopping happens a few tens of microseconds before voltage zero crossing; thereafter, a remnant conductance in the contact gap is observed, lasting for up to several milliseconds. This can be explained by an arc-to-glow transition in the presence of hydrogen. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: Isolated communities face a variety of inconveniences including severe remoteness, poor roads and extreme climate conditions, resulting in the lack of security of supply chains and exorbitant prices for cargo delivery. This paper aims to investigate the present advantages and prospects of applying 3-D printing to improve economics and everyday life of remote communities, reindeer herder case taken as an example. Design/methodology/approach: This study covers the use of a low-cost open-source 3-D printer (RepRap) capable of fused filament fabrication to reduce operating costs for nomadic reindeer herder groups. Three case studies are provided for reindeer-specific applications to probe economic and technical viability of the technology, namely, ear-tags, electric fence components and lasso accessories. Findings: 3-D printed objects feature technical characteristics similar to those of analogues available on the market while reducing the price by 63 per cent. Distributed 3-D printing reduces the cost of raw materials by 68 per cent and shipping costs by 50 because of lower trip frequency. If all reindeer herders globally were to adopt distributed manufacturing of the three aforementioned sample items only, their annual savings from such solution would amount to US$2m. The paper discovers other economic, entrepreneurial, technical and environmental opportunities offered by 3-D printing put to service the needs of remote communities. Research limitations: As the paper is the first-ever study of 3-D printing potential applied to the reindeer husbandry case, it is based on a more thorough analysis of the techno-economic feasibility of the technology, while cultural and entrepreneurial factors have been discussed as preconditions only. Practical implications: The paper might serve as a valuable source of information for entrepreneurs, as well as for students and academics for further case studies in this area. Originality/value: In remote conditions, 3-D printing offers a more sustainable way of good manufacturing. Numerous open source designs already available for specialists, financial effectiveness, environmental benefits and vast opportunities for entrepreneurs are among the most promising advantages of the technology. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - As a growing number of companies reject intellectual property (IP) monopoly-based business models to embrace libre product development of free and open source hardware and software, there is an urgent need to refurbish the instruments of university-corporate research partnerships. These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research. Under the SLRA, university researchers can spend more time innovating for the same investment. © 2018 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research. This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many efforts are making science more open and accessible; they are mostly concentrated on issues that appear before and after experiments are performed: open access journals, open databases, and many other tools to increase reproducibility of science and access to information. However, these initiatives do not promote access to scientific equipment necessary for experiments. Mostly due to monetary constraints, equipment availability has always been uneven around the globe, affecting predominantly low-income countries and institutions. Here, a case is made for the use of free open source hardware in research and education, including countries and institutions where funds were never the biggest problem.

AB  - Barriers to inventing electronic devices involve challenges of iterating electronic designs due to long lead times for professional circuit board milling or high costs of commercial milling machines. To overcome these barriers, this study provides open source (OS) designs for a low-cost circuit milling machine. First, design modifications for mechanical and electrical subsystems of the OS Distributed 3-D (D3D) Robotics prototyping system are provided. Next, Copper Carve, an OS custom graphical user interface, is developed to enable circuit board milling by implementing backlash and substrate distortion compensation. The performance of the OS D3D circuit mill is then quantified and validated for: positional accuracy, cut quality, feature accuracy, and distortion compensation. Finally, the return on investment is calculated for inventors using it. The results show by properly compensating for motion inaccuracies with Copper Carve, the machine achieves a motion resolution of 10 microns, which is more than adequate for most circuit designs. The mill is at least five times less expensive than all commercial alternatives and the material costs of the D3D mill are repaid from fabricating 20–43 boards. The results show that the OS circuit mill is of high-enough quality to enable rapid invention and distributed manufacturing of complex products containing custom electronics. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Desktop 3D printers have revolutionized how designers and makers prototype and manufacture certain products. Highly popular fuse deposition modeling (FDM) desktop printers have enabled a shift to low-cost consumer goods markets, through reduced capital equipment investment and consumable material costs. However, with this drive to reduce costs, the computer numerical control (CNC) systems implemented in FDM printers are often compromised by poor accuracy and contouring errors. This condition is most critical as users begin to use 3D-printed components in load-bearing applications or to perform mechanical functions. Improved methods of low-cost 3D printer calibration are needed before their open-design potential can be realized in applications, including 3D-printed orthotics and prosthetics. This paper applies methodologies associated with high-precision CNC machining systems, namely, kinematic error modeling and compensation coupled with standardized test methods from ISO230-4, such as the ballbar for kinematic and dynamic error measurements, to examine the influence and feasibility for use on low-cost CNC/3D printing platforms. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's “Technical considerations for additive manufactured medical devices” highlighted the need to develop standards specific to additive manufacturing in regulated manufacturing environments. This paper shows the benefits of the methods described within ISO230-4 for error assessment, alongside applying kinematic error modeling and compensation to the popular kinematic configuration of an Ultimaker 3D printer. A Renishaw ballbar QC10 is used to quantify the Ultimaker's errors and thereby populate the error model. This method quantifies machine errors and populates these in a mathematical model of the CNC system. Then, a post-processor can be used to compensate the printing code. Subsequently, the ballbar is used to demonstrate the dramatic impact of the error compensation model on the accuracy and contouring of the Ultimaker printer with 58% reduction in overall circularity error and 90% reduction in squareness error. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much as possible on open hardware. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Advances in scientific knowledge are increasingly supported by a growing community of developers freely sharing new hardware and software tools. In this spirit we have developed a free Android app, ABE-VIEW, that provides a flexible graphical user interface (GUI) populated entirely from a remote instrument by ascii-coded instructions communicated wirelessly over Bluetooth. Options include an interactive chart for plotting data in real time, up to 16 data fields, and virtual controls including buttons, numerical controls with user-defined range and resolution, and radio buttons which the user can use to send coded instructions back to the instrument. Data can be recorded into comma delimited files interactively at the user’s discretion. Our original objective of the project was to make data acquisition and control for undergraduate engineering labs more modular and affordable, but we have also found that the tool is highly useful for rapidly testing novel sensor systems for iterative improvement. Here we document the operation of the app and syntax for communicating with it. We also illustrate its application in undergraduate engineering labs on dynamic systems modeling, as well as for identifying the source of harmonic distortion affecting electrochemical impedance measurements at certain frequencies in a novel wireless potentiostat. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - We propose a new signature-based, on-demand anti-virus solution using in-storage processing (ISP) to inspect the inside of a storage device. In-storage anti-virus systems are able to isolate malicious effects from main computing platforms, and they reduce the system overhead for virus detection. We implement our in-storage anti-virus platform using cost-effective, open-source hardware, and we verify that is practically applicable to storage devices.

AB  - The design and construction of a low-cost and compact USB photometer based on open source hardware and software is described. The device, featuring a 1 ms sample acquisition time, utilizes a single interchangeable light emitting diode (LED) as a light source in combination with photodiode detectors and a Texas Instruments LaunchPad as the main control unit. An appropriately constructed flow cell can be connected to a flow reactor made out of transparent polymeric material such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing. The flow cell can be moved to different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine the residence time distribution (RTD) of various microreactors/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition time of the novel device the lengths of individual segments can be measured in real time. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - We introduce Dimitri, an open-software & open-hardware humanoid robot with 31 DOFs, fitted with cost-effective modular compliant joints and parallel link legs, designed for advanced human-robot interaction research, force-informed object handling and intelligent environment discovery. Our main innovation is in the design of a robust full-body biped humanoid robot equipped with very low-cost polyurethane torsional spring fixed to traditional servo motors and a circuit to measure angular displacement, transforming the system into a series elastic actuator (SEA). In order to illustrate the robot’s qualities in the field of machine learning applied to robotics and manipulation, a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN) is implemented, allowing the robot to replicate combined movement sequences earlier taught via interactive demonstration. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts’ behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital “Raymundo Abarca Alarcón,” constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Many aspects of the fundamental spatiotemporal organization of cells are governed by reaction-diffusion type systems. In vitro reconstitution of such systems allows for detailed studies of their underlying mechanisms which would not be feasible in vivo. Here, we provide a protocol for the in vitro reconstitution of the MinCDE system of Escherichia coli, which positions the cell division septum in the cell middle. The assay is designed to supply only the components necessary for self-organization, namely a membrane, the two proteins MinD and MinE and energy in the form of ATP. We therefore fabricate an open reaction chamber on a coverslip, on which a supported lipid bilayer is formed. The open design of the chamber allows for optimal preparation of the lipid bilayer and controlled manipulation of the bulk content. The two proteins, MinD and MinE, as well as ATP, are then added into the bulk volume above the membrane. Imaging is possible by many optical microscopies, as the design supports confocal, wide-field and TIRF microscopy alike. In a variation of the protocol, the lipid bilayer is formed on a patterned support, on cell-shaped PDMS microstructures, instead of glass. Lowering the bulk solution to the rim of these compartments encloses the reaction in a smaller compartment and provides boundaries that allow mimicking of in vivo oscillatory behavior. Taken together, we describe protocols to reconstitute the MinCDE system both with and without spatial confinement, allowing researchers to precisely control all aspects influencing pattern formation, such as concentration ranges and addition of other factors or proteins, and to systematically increase system complexity in a relatively simple experimental setup. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

AB  - As a result of the globalisation of the semiconductor design and fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, a general architecture for the implementation of software-defined optoelectronic systems is described. This concept harnesses the flexibility of software-defined hardware to implement optoelectronic systems which can be configured to adapt to multiple high speed optical engineering applications. As an application example, a software-defined optical interferometer using a commercial software-defined radio platform is built. The system is tested by performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic signals in a concentrated dye solution. Using software modifications only, conventional single carrier and also multicarrier heterodyne techniques with space and frequency diversity are performed. The latter technique shows a noticeable performance improvement in single-shot interferometric measurements. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - “Smart” water systems are transforming the field of stormwater management by enabling real-time monitoring and control of previously static infrastructure. While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream—such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system’s control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Current debates on knowledge-based and creative locational development have come to deal with small urban places of novelty that formerly remained unnoticed. A plethora of new forms of producing and working recently emerged in unplanned and uncoordinated ways, bearing odd names such as FabLabs, Open Worklabs, RealLabs, Open Design Cities, Techshops, Repair Cafés, and more (Smith, A., M. Fressoli, D. Abrol, E. Arond, and A. Ely. 2017. Grassroots Innovation Movements. London: Routledge). Political initiatives have been taken by surprise; at the same time, standard epistemic tools of the social sciences and economics have been rendered unfit. More concise analytical reconstructions are needed to adequately capture the variety and complexity of these “labs”, their heterogeneous causation, their contingent proceedings, their surplus of latency, their peculiar power relations and their local embeddings. Urban social contexts have a strong triggering function as they help to re-configure older, and create new, combinations of heterogeneous social and economic agency. Meanwhile strong elements of grassroots innovation (Smith et al. 2017) have informed the formation of various models of alternative work and production. Taking the phenotype of open workshops as a revealing example, we take assemblage theory to describe the constitutive features of these new types of self-organised work, and the associated places of innovation. A fresh gaze on the complexity and open-endedness of socio-material formations may help to better understand the nature of emerging post-growth economies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have the potential to assist in real-life tasks involving grasping and transportation, but not before solving several difficult research challenges. In this work, we address the design, control, estimation, and planning problems for cooperative localization, grasping, and transportation of objects in challenging outdoor scenarios. We demonstrate an autonomous team of MAVs able to plan safe trajectories for manipulation of ferrous objects, while guaranteeing interrobot collision avoidance and automatically creating a map of the objects in the environment. Our solution is predominantly distributed, allowing the team to pick and transport ferrous disks to a final destination without collisions. This result is achieved using a new magnetic gripper with a novel feedback approach, enabling the detection of successful grasping. The gripper design and all the components to build a platform are clearly provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the proposed solution is validated through experimental results, where difficulties include inconsistent wind, uneven terrain, and sandy conditions. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Many organizations are resorting to open prize-based challenges and competitions to identify the best possible designs for their future products or services. As an example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hosted an open challenge for designing the drivetrain and mobility subsystem of a Fast Adaptable Next-Generation Ground Vehicle (FANG-1) in early 2013. A $1 million prize was awarded to the team with the highest concept score and the design was subsequently physically implemented and tested. The competition was the first attempt by DARPA to utilize crowdsourcing for the design of complex military systems, which is in contrast with contracting directly with a small number of incumbent firms within the defense industry. The competition attracted over 200 participating teams and the winning team was announced in April 2013. In this paper, inspired by the FANG-1 challenge, a generalizable simulation model for predicting the dynamics of open prize-based design challenges and competitions is developed using a combination of several modeling methods. The model is then applied to simulate the dynamics of the FANG-1 challenge ex post facto, including an approximation of the distribution of team scores as well as the interteam motivational interactions. Using the simulation model, various sensitivity analyses were then performed to identify factors that could enhance future design challenges and competitions in terms of resulting innovation and productivity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Millimeter-wave (mmWave) with large spectrum available is considered as the most promising frequency band for future wireless communications. The IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ay operating on 60 GHz mmWave are the two most expected wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies for ultra-high-speed communications. For the IEEE 802.11ay standard still under development, there are plenty of proposals from companies and researchers who are involved with the IEEE 802.11ay task group. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on the medium access control layer (MAC) related issues for the IEEE 802.11ay, some cross-layer between physical layer and MAC technologies are also included. We start with MAC related technologies in the IEEE 802.11ad and discuss design challenges on mmWave communications, leading to some MAC related technologies for the IEEE 802.11ay. We then elaborate on important design issues for IEEE 802.11ay. Specifically, we review the channel bonding and aggregation for the IEEE 802.11ay, and point out the major differences between the two technologies. Then, we describe channel access and channel allocation in the IEEE 802.11ay, including spatial sharing and interference mitigation technologies. After that, we present an in-depth survey on beamforming training, beam tracking, single-user multiple-input-multiple-output beamforming, and multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output beamforming. Finally, we discuss some open design issues and future research directions for mmWave WLANs. We hope that this paper provides a good introduction to this exciting research area for future wireless systems. © 1998-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the relationship of wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) on heat-related incidents and alterations in matchplay and behavioural characteristics in women's tennis at the Australian Open. Design: From 360 main draw Australian Open women's matches (2014-2016), data describing on-court calls for trainers, doctors, cooling devices and water, post match medical consults and matchplay characteristics were collated. Methods: Data were referenced against estimated WBGT and categorised into standard zones (zone 5: >32.3 °C, zone 4: 30.1–32.2 °C, zone 3: 27.9–30 °C, zone 2: 22.3–27.9 °C, zone 1: <22.2 °C). Generalized linear models assessed the association of WBGT zone on heat-related medical incidences, court call-outs and match characteristics. Results: With an increased estimated WBGT zone, there was an increase in total trainer calls (+19.5%/zone; p = 0.019), total doctor calls (+54.1%; p < 0.001), total calls for heat related incidents (+55.9%; p < 0.001), and cooling devices (+31.4%; p < 0.001) calculated from the regression slope. When match characteristics were adjusted for match quality, significant decreases (p < 0.001) in the number of winners and net approaches and increase in double faults were associated with increased estimated WBGT zone. Conclusions: An association between higher estimated WBGT and medical callouts (heat and non-heat related) was evident, with an increased call rate >32 °C WBGT, despite no heat-related retirements. As estimated WBGT increased, the number of winners and net approaches were reduced, while double faults increased, particularly >30 °C WBGT. Accordingly, the manner in which female players manage and play in the heat during women's Grand Slam tennis appears to change at ≈30 °C WBGT. © 2018 Sports Medicine Australia

AB  - Conventional passive air samplers (PAS) and passive dry deposition samplers (PAS-DD) were deployed along a 90ĝ€km south-north transect at five sites in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) during October to November 2015. The purpose was to compare and characterize the performance of the two passive sampling methods for targeted compounds across a range of site types. Samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), and oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs). ΣPAC and ΣNPAH concentrations were highest in PAS and PAS-DD samplers at site AMS5, which is the closest sampling site to surface mining and upgrading facilities. The OPAHs were elevated at site AMS6, which is located in the town of Fort McMurray, approximately 30ĝ€km south of the main mining area. PAS-DD was enriched relative to PAS in particle-associated target chemicals, which is consistent with the relatively more open design of PAS-DD intended to capture particle-phase (and gas-phase) deposition. Petroleum coke (petcoke) (i.e., the carbonaceous byproduct of bitumen upgrading) and oil sands ore (i.e., the material mined in open-pit mines from which bitumen is extracted) were assessed for their potential to be a source of PACs to air in the oil sands region. The ore samples contained ~8 times and ~40 times higher ΣPACs concentrations (dry weight basis) than delayed and fluid petcoke, respectively. The residue analysis of ore and petcoke samples also revealed that the chemical 4-nitrobiphenyl (4-NBP) can be used to track gas-phase emissions to air. A comparison of chemical residues in ore, petcoke, and air samples revealed that the ore is likely a major contributor to volatile PACs present in air and that both ore and petcoke are contributing to the particle-associated PACs in air near open-pit mining areas. The contribution of petcoke particles in passive air samples was also confirmed qualitatively using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Fog computing is gaining attention due to the potential of aggregating and processing time-sensitive data at the nearby intelligent gateways. It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM/GPRS technology and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog Gateways scheme in real-time application. © 2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work describes the first imaging studies on a 1.0 Tesla inline MRI-Linac using a dedicated transmit/receive RF body coil that has been designed to be completely radio transparent and provide optimum imaging performance over a large patient opening. A series of experiments was performed on the MRI-Linac to investigate the performance and imaging characteristics of a new dedicated volumetric RF coil: (1) numerical electromagnetic simulations were used to measure transmit efficiency in two patient positions; (2) image quality metrics of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ghosting and uniformity were assessed in a large diameter phantom with no radiation beam; (3) radiation induced effects were investigated in both the raw data (k-space) and image sequences acquired with simultaneous irradiation; (4) radiation dose was measured with and without image acquisition; (5) RF heating was studied using an MR-compatible fluoroptic thermometer and; (6) the in vivo image quality and versatility of the coil was demonstrated in normal healthy subjects for both supine and standing positions. Daily phantom measurements demonstrated excellent imaging performance with stable SNR over a period of 3 months (42.6 ± 0.9). Simultaneous irradiation produced no statistical change in image quality (p > 0.74) and no interference in raw data for a 20 × 20 cm radiation field. The coil was found to be efficient over large volumes and negligible RF heating was observed. Volunteer scans acquired in both supine and standing positions provided artefact free images with good anatomical visualisation. The first completely radio transparent RF coil for use on a 1.0 Tesla MRI-Linac has been described. There is no impact on either the imaging or dosimetry performance with a simultaneous radiation beam. The open design enables imaging and radiotherapy guidance in a variety of positons. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - Supported by easier and cheaper access to tools and expanding communities, maker cultures are pointing towards the ideas of (almost) everyone designing, creating, producing and distributing renewed, new and improved products, machines, things or artefacts. A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: The principal motivation for regulating medical devices is to protect patients and users. Complying with regulations may result in an increase in development, manufacturing and service costs for medical companies and ultimately for healthcare providers and patients, limiting the access to adequate medical equipment. On the other hand, poor regulatory control has resulted in the use of substandard devices. This study aims at comparing the certification route that manufactures have to respect for marketing a medical device in some African Countries and in European Union. Methods: We examined and compared the current and future regulations on medical devices in the European Union and in some countries in Africa. Contextually we proposed future approaches to open design strategies supported by emerging technologies as a means to enhance economically sustainable healthcare system driven by innovation. Results: African medical device regulations have an affinity to European directives, despite the fact that the latter are particularly strict. Several states have also implemented or harmonized directives to medical device regulation, or have expressed interest in establishing them in their legislation. Open Source Medical Devices hold a great promise to reduce costs but do need a high level of supervision, to control their quality and to guarantee their respect for safety standards. Conclusion: Harmonization across the two continents could be leveraged to optimize the costs of device manufacture and sale. Regulated open design strategies can enhance economically sustainable innovation. © 2018 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine

AB  - A promising approach to reducing the >870, 000 deaths/year globally from unsafe water is flow-through solar water pasteurization systems (SWPs). Unfortunately, demonstrated systems have high capital costs, which limits access for the poor. The most expensive component of such systems is the heat exchanger (HX). Thus, this study focuses on cost optimization of HX designs for flow-through SWPs using high-effectiveness polymer microchannel HXs. The theoretical foundation for the cost optimization of a polymer microchannel HX is provided, and outputs are plotted in order to provide guidelines for designers to perform HX optimizations. These plots are used in two case studies: (1) substitution of a coiled copper HX with polymer microchannel HX, and (2) design of a polymer microchannel HX for a 3-D printed collector that can fit in an arbitrary build volume. The results show that substitution of the polymer expanded HX reduced the overall expenditure for the system by a factor 50, which aids in making the system more economical. For the second case study, the results show how future system designers can optimize an HX for an arbitrary SWP geometry. The approach of distributed manufacturing using laser welding appears promising for HX for SWP. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab’s approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen/civic veillance, or “sousveillance”, by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential–drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manufacturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable. This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them. Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (Turtle-Bot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future. © 2018 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a very popular tool for diagnostic applications and research studies. Low-field MR scanners, usually with an open design, are suitable for claustrophobic and obese patients, as well as for children, who may be fearful in closed MR scanners. However, these types of scanners provide lower spatial resolution and a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) if compared with the same examination performed at the same time at high field scanners. It is dominantly caused by the low field strength and other factors, such as radiofrequency noise. Therefore, a long measurement time is usually necessary. This research paper is focused on the development of novel probes and preamplifiers for low-field MR scanners to improve SNR, and thus, shorten the measurement time. In this study, we describe the design of a high impedance preamplifier and a high temperature superconductor (HTS) coil. This novel instrumentation was compared with uncooled and cooled copper coils. Improvement in SNR in the case of an HTS coil is reported. © 2018 Daniel Gogola, published by Sciendo.

AB  - Low productivity of microalgal cultures leads to a high cost of the fuel feedstock. Turbidostat operation, which automatically monitors and controls biomass density, is a mean to manage biomass density and internal light intensity, so that biomass productivity can be maximized. Available versions of turbidostat control are expensive and not amenable to large-scale operation. We designed a system that costs less than $250 and that can be used for any type of microbiological system. It includes an in-line, infrared turbidity sensor connected to an Arduino ATmega microcontroller and auxiliary power replays. The target biomass density is adjustable, and key operating data – such as time stamps, pump status, and set and measured values of biomass density – are available in real time and logged continuously. The sensor's output was linear for OD730 from 0.5 to 4.5, which brackets the realistic ranges for microalgae culturing. We tested the turbidostat with step-down and step-up experiments with Synechocystis cultures. The turbidostat maintained stable biomass concentrations for all steps. The results of the turbidostat experiments demonstrated how turbidity control leads to systematic management of average internal light intensity, specific growth rate, and biomass production rate. This open-design, low-cost system should promote higher productivity and help make microalgae biomass an affordable fuel feedstock. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Companies selling dental implant guided systems mostly offer similar surgical guides. The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative-guided surgery system which originality lies in its guidance device, and to report the author's experience in using this system for dental implant surgery. Technical protocol: Two parallel tubes on either side of the drilling axis guide the successive drills and the implant placement. As a result of the lateral guidance, there is no friction of the drills on the surgical guide, which would damage it or contaminate the drilling hole with particles torn out from the guide. No radiological guide is needed during the radiographic examination stage. No successive diameter reduction tubes are requested. This guide can be used for all brands of implants. Discussion: In our experience, 67 implants (31 titanium and 36 zircon implants) were placed in 35 patients with guided surgery system. Multiple clinical cases were treated with this system: ‘one-stage’ or a ‘two-stage’ surgical protocol, with flap and flapless surgical techniques, and with delayed or immediate loading. Clinical cases treated revealed good implant placement with planning. The widely open design of this guide allows irrigation and practitioner's sight control under conditions comparable to those of operations performed without surgical guide. Conclusion: This dental implant guided system appears to be a significant advance in the field of implant surgical guides. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Purpose To retrospectively assess lurasidone effectiveness/efficacy/tolerability in bipolar disorder (BD) patients. Methods Outpatients assessed with Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD Affective Disorders Evaluation received naturalistically administered (primarily adjunctive) open lurasidone while monitored at visits with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD Clinical Monitoring Form. Results Sixty-one patients (32 type I, 26 type II, 3 type not otherwise specified; mean ± SD age, 45.1 ± 14.0 years; 63.9% were female) received lurasidone with 3.1 ± 1.4 (≥2 in 88.5%, monotherapy in only 3.3%) other nonanxiolytic/hypnotic prescription psychotropics, started during syndromal depression in 57.4%, subsyndromal depression in 23.0%, and euthymia in 19.7%. Lurasidone was taken for median 126 days, with final dose 55.6 ± 30.8 mg/d. By final visit taking lurasidone, syndromal depression rate decreased by nearly one-half to 31.1%, and euthymia rate more than doubled to 42.6%, whereas subsyndromal depression rate was unchanged at 23.0%. Clinical Global Impressions-BD-Overall Severity improved significantly only in patients with baseline syndromal depression. Seventy-seven percent of patients discontinued lurasidone after median 103 days, because of adverse events in 54.1% (most often akathisia, sedation/somnolence, nausea, and weight gain), inefficacy in 16.4%, and other reasons in 6.6%; 12.1% had equal to or greater than 7% weight gain, and 3.3% developed hypomania. Limitations to this study were the open design and demographically homogeneous (relatively affluent, predominantly white female) small sample taking complex pharmacotherapy. Conclusions In American specialty clinic BD outpatients, adjunctive longer-Term lurasidone commonly relieved syndromal depression and maintained euthymia, suggesting possible effectiveness/efficacy. However, lurasidone was discontinued in 54.1% because of adverse events, suggesting tolerability limitations in these challenging patients, nearly 90% of whom were already taking at least 2 other nonanxiolytic/hypnotic prescription psychotropics. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a cost-effective implementation method of a ball and plate system as an educational kit and present the application of sliding mode control to achieve better control performance. We choose a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance, and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system can be efficiently used as an educational tool. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of >99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions. © 2018 Nandy et al.

AB  - The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: “AudioMoth.” The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of ∼US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Bringing a new product to market involves both a creative ideation stage and an execution stage. When time-to-market constraints are binding, important questions are how to divide limited time between the two stages and who should make this decision. We introduce a laboratory experiment that closely resembles this setting: it features a product development task with an open design space, a downstream cost increase, and two development stages.We show that performance is significantly worse when designers choose for themselves when to transition from ideation to execution and that decision control explains a large share of performance variation even after controlling for individual differences. How the time is allocated between ideation and execution does not affect mean performance, but later transition increases risk. One driver of poor design outcomes in the designer-initiated transition regime are delays in physical construction and testing of designs. We show that such delays can be prevented by "nudging" designers toward early prototyping. However, the most important performance driver is the lack of task structure in endogenous regimes, which can be remedied by demanding a concrete, performance-oriented deliverable prior to a transition. © 2017 INFORMS.

AB  - Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:- accounts currently for one of the most common serotypes observed worldwide. These isolates do not express the FljB flagellin and mostly derive from Salmonella Typhimurium. They are therefore termed Salmonella Typhimurium monophasic variants (STMV) and are considered of comparable public health risk. Since serological identification of the somatic and flagellar antigens of STMV is not sufficient to demonstrate relatedness with Salmonella Typhimurium, additional assays detecting genetic markers unique to Salmonella Typhimurium are required. In addition, identification of the mutations affecting expression of the flagellar gene fljB can be useful to support the monophasic character observed phenotypically. Finally, genetic subtyping of the various mono- and biphasic Salmonella Typhimurium clonal groups can facilitate their epidemiological follow-up. Here, we present a home-made liquid bead array able to fulfill these requirements. This array confirmed the monophasic character of 240 STMV isolates collected in Belgium during 2014–2015 and identified 10 genetic subtypes. Microevolution in and around the fljB locus linked to IS26 insertions is probably one of the driven force accounting for STMV population diversity. Thanks to its open design, other genetic signatures could later be merged to the assay to subtype additional STMV clonal groups and to detect rare mutations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Scientific communities are drawn to the open source model as an increasingly utilitarian method to produce and share work. Initially used as a means to develop freely-available software, open source projects have been applied to hardware including scientific tools. Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments are usually carried out at very high and homogenous magnetic fields. However, portable systems have emerged in recent years at low fields, offering many advantages like easier maintenance and open design that permit us to imagine a variety of coil configurations in order to maximize the homogeneity of the static field <i>B</i>0 and the radio-frequency field <i>B</i>1. The wire winding distribution based on space harmonics suppression (SHS) of the cosine current density distribution offers new possibilities of producing homogenous static fields <i>B</i>0. In this work, an extension of the SHS method, allowing homogeneity enhancement and flexibility of the coil design, is presented. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated through the construction of homogenous magnetic field coils dedicated to a very low magnetic field (8ĝ€mT) 1<i>H</i> NMR spectrometer. The performance of these coils in terms of magnetic field intensity and homogeneity as well as self-heating behavior is compliant with <i>in planta</i> experiments for agronomic studies. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry technology has been a boon to animal spatial ecology studies. Oftentimes, the main limitation to widespread application of this technology is the cost, which can dictate the number of individuals outfitted with GPS technology, thereby limiting sample sizes. Here, we discuss the development of a low-cost, customizable, open-source hardware GPS logger for use in animal movement studies. We also present results from field tests with Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) in northwestern Ohio. These GPS loggers have the potential to augment existing projects and facilitate studies that would be otherwise cost-prohibitive. © 2018

AB  - Applications involving data acquisition from sensors need samples at a preset frequency rate, the filtering out of noise and/or analysis of certain frequency components. We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and intuitive. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microfluidic devices with integrated valves provide precise, programmable fluid handling platforms for high-throughput biological or chemical assays. However, setting up the infrastructure to control such platforms often requires specific engineering expertise or expensive commercial solutions. To address these obstacles, we present a Kit for Arduino-based Transistor Array Actuation (KATARA), an open-source and low-cost Arduino-based controller that can drive 70 solenoid valves to pneumatically actuate integrated microfluidic valves. We include a python package with a GUI to control the KATARA from a personal computer. No programming experience is required. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Syringe pump extruders are required for a wide range of 3D printing applications, including bioprinting, embedded printing, and food printing. However, the mass of the syringe becomes a major challenge for most printing platforms, requiring compromises in speed, resolution and/or volume. To address these issues, we have designed a syringe pump large volume extruder (LVE) that is compatible with low-cost, open source 3D printers, and herein demonstrate its performance on a PrintrBot Simple Metal. Key aspects of the LVE include: (1) it is open source and compatible with open source hardware and software, making it inexpensive and widely accessible to the 3D printing community, (2) it utilizes a standard 60 mL syringe as its ink reservoir, effectively increasing print volume of the average bioprinter, (3) it is capable of retraction and high speed movements, and (4) it can print fluids using nozzle diameters as small as 100 μm, enabling the printing of complex shapes/objects when used in conjunction with the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) 3D printing method. Printing performance of the LVE is demonstrated by utilizing alginate as a model biomaterial ink to fabricate parametric CAD models and standard calibration objects. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - BACKGROUND: In our large community hospital, we observed that traditional oxygen masks were sometimes set at an inappropriately low flow. We hoped to eliminate this safety concern through adoption of an open-design oxygen mask. We also hoped that more immediate flow changes would lead to a decrease in medical gas consumption. Finally, by standardizing to one mask, goals were to reduce the cost of oxygen delivery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis, 12 months before and 12 months after implementation of the open-design oxygen mask. Unusual occurrence reports related to supplemental oxygen delivery were reviewed. Oxygen device use and bulk oxygen consumption were recorded. The total number of patient days was obtained from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: There were no unusual occurrence reports or concerns involving an oxygen device in those areas that converted to the open-design oxygen mask. In fiscal year 2014, bulk oxygen use was 13,036,686 cubic feet, and there were 74,734 patient days. In fiscal year 2016, bulk oxygen use was 12,072,610 cubic feet and there were 99,428 patient days. The reduction in oxygen consumption was $3,670 despite the increase in patient days. In fiscal year 2014, 3,848 oxygen devices were used for a cost of $3,411, and in fiscal year 2016, 5,512 devices were used for a cost of $12,963. The net savings from open-design oxygen mask conversion was $23,487 annual and corrected for increased patient population. Oxygen consumption and supply cost per patient day resulted in $1.19 per patient day pre-implementation and $0.95 after implementation of the open-design oxygen mask (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: The open-design oxygen mask may be a safe and less costly alternative to traditional oxygen delivery devices.

AB  - Purpose The Italian Network of Longitudinal Metropolitan Studies (IN-LiMeS) is a system of integrated data on health outcomes, demographic and socioeconomic information, and represents a powerful tool to study health inequalities. Participants IN-LiMeS is a multicentre and multipurpose pool of metropolitan population cohorts enrolled in nine Italian cities: Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Florence, Leghorn, Prato and Rome. Data come from record linkage of municipal population registries, the 2001 population census, mortality registers and hospital discharge archives. Depending on the source of enrolment, cohorts can be closed or open. The census-based closed cohort design includes subjects resident in any of the nine cities at the 2001 census day; 4 466 655 individuals were enrolled in 2001 in the nine closed cohorts. The open cohort design includes subjects resident in 2001 or subsequently registered by birth or immigration until the latest available follow-up (currently 31 December 2013). The open cohort design is available for Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Prato and Rome. Detailed socioeconomic data are available for subjects enrolled in the census-based cohorts; information on demographic characteristics, education and citizenship is available from population registries. Findings to date The first IN-LiMeS application was the study of differentials in mortality between immigrants and Italians. Either using a closed cohort design (nine cities) or an open one (Turin and Reggio Emilia), individuals from high migration pressure countries generally showed a lower mortality risk. However, a certain heterogeneity between the nine cities was noted, especially among men, and an excess mortality risk was reported for some macroareas of origin and specific causes of death. Future plans We are currently working on the linkage of the 2011 population census data, the expansion of geographical coverage and the implementation of the open design in all the participating cohorts. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB  - Highly developed drone technology enables the use of drones in a wide variety of areas. However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big research topic and find a market in the near future. We developed an underwater drone with a 360° panoramic camera acting as the 'eye' of the drone. The designs are based on the open-source hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360° panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment. Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic in the artificial intelligence research field today. Experimental results show that the function of the underwater drone achieved at diving in the leak automatically. The 360° panoramic images were generated correctly. Fish recognition achieved 87% accuracy by deep learning. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Accelerometer-based technologies could be useful in providing objective measures of canine ambulation, but most are either not tailored to the idiosyncrasies of canine gait, or, use un-validated or closed source approaches. The aim of this paper was to validate algorithms which could be applied to accelerometer data for i) counting the number of steps and ii) distance travelled by a dog. To count steps, an approach based on partitioning acceleration was used. This was applied to accelerometer data from 13 dogs which were walked a set distance and filmed. Each footfall captured on video was annotated. In a second experiment, an approach based on signal features was used to estimate distance travelled. This was applied to accelerometer data from 10 dogs with osteoarthritis during normal walks with their owners where GPS (Global Positioning System) was also captured. Pearson's correlations and Bland Altman statistics were used to compare i) the number of steps measured on video footage and predicted by the algorithm and ii) the distance travelled estimated by GPS and predicted by the algorithm. Results: Both step count and distance travelled could be estimated accurately by the algorithms presented in this paper: 4695 steps were annotated from the video and the pedometer was able to detect 91%. GPS logged a total of 20,184 m meters across all dogs; the mean difference between the predicted and GPS estimated walk length was 211 m and the mean similarity was 79%. Conclusions: The algorithms described show promise in detecting number of steps and distance travelled from an accelerometer. The approach for detecting steps might be advantageous to methods which estimate gross activity because these include energy output from stationary activities. The approach for estimating distance might be suited to replacing GPS in indoor environments or others with limited satellite signal. The algorithms also allow for temporal and spatial components of ambulation to be calculated. Temporal and spatial aspects of dog ambulation are clinical indicators which could be used for diagnosis or monitoring of certain diseases, or used to provide information in support of canine weight-loss programmes. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Distributed digital manufacturing of free and open-source scientific hardware (FOSH) used for scientific experiments has been shown to in general reduce the costs of scientific hardware by 90–99%. In part due to these cost savings, the manufacturing of scientific equipment is beginning to move away from a central paradigm of purchasing proprietary equipment to one in which scientists themselves download open-source designs, fabricate components with digital manufacturing technology, and then assemble the equipment themselves. This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under $20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications. By designing using open-source principles and the proposed procedures, the outcome will be customizable, under control of the researcher, less expensive than commercial options, more maintainable, and will have many applications that benefit the user since the design documentation is open and freely accessible. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO 2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17–49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in many areas, such as intelligent transportation, smart city, hospital, games, education. Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the students’ answer to teachers’ managerment system, where there exists high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students’ identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms, such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students’ behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen the motivation of students’ learning. This IoT system can improve the attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students’ learning process for higher education. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literature without specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We will present the development of NDA free VLSI design flow for 0.6µm commercial fabrication. Our design flow will help users to democratize VLSI design. The flow consists of two parts. One is the layout design with a scalable open design rule. The other is to translate the scalable design rule to the specific rules provided by fabrication company under NDA. Ordinary user does not have to care on the second flow but stay at the first flow which will be enough to fabricate their VLSI chip. The chip with this method was fabricated in success. © 2018, ICIC International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neural network formation is a complex process involving axon outgrowth and guidance. Axon guidance is facilitated by structural and molecular cues from the surrounding microenvironment. Micro-fabrication techniques can be employed to produce microfluidic chips with a highly controlled microenvironment for neural cells enabling longitudinal studies of complex processes associated with network formation. In this work, we demonstrate a novel open microfluidic chip design that encompasses a freely variable number of nodes interconnected by axon-permissible tunnels, enabling structuring of multi-nodal neural networks in vitro. The chip employs a partially open design to allow high level of control and reproducibility of cell seeding, while reducing shear stress on the cells. We show that by culturing dorsal root ganglion cells (DRGs) in our microfluidic chip, we were able to structure a neural network in vitro. These neurons were compartmentalized within six nodes interconnected through axon growth tunnels. Furthermore, we demonstrate the additional benefit of open top design by establishing a 3D neural culture in matrigel and a neuronal aggregate 3D culture within the chips. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel microfluidic chip design applicable to structuring complex neural networks in vitro, thus providing a versatile, highly relevant platform for the study of neural network dynamics applicable to developmental and regenerative neuroscience. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are increasingly being deployed for surveillance and monitoring applications. WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Research Findings: Digital play is now commonplace in many young children’s lives, but not in preschool settings. This situation is likely due to the fact that the existent literature seldom highlights what digital play looks like, the various ways it can be situated, and what young children do when they play together with digital devices in the preschool setting. The present study addresses this limitation by providing a close examination of the social interactions of young children as they engage with different types of iPad apps and each other. Observational data of 20 dyads of children during digital play analyzed qualitatively revealed that children exhibited a range of social behaviors from competitive to collaborative as they engaged in 4 types of digital play: practice/task, exploratory, construction, and pretense. Forms of play and exhibited behaviors were shaped by interrelated factors of children’s individual characteristics and relationships, classroom culture and routines, adult views and actions, as well as aspects of the digital device itself. Practice or Policy: Selecting open-design apps, attending to digital play structures, and monitoring peer play more closely may lessen competition, enhance collaboration, and lead to more complex digital play. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware codesign leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem. © Copyright 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - In this study, the effect of web based power electronics courses on the success of electrical engineering candidates was examined. The participants are consisted of daytime education (30) and evening education (42) students who attended the “Power Electronics” course. First, groups were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups and experimental group and control group were examined according to the students’ GPAs, university entrance exam results, academic grades depending on 8 different lectures related with power electronics. According to the results obtained from validity and reliability of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test, the total correlation values and the standard deviation values of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test were between.301–,.598 and between.304–,.506, respectively. In addition, KR20 coefficient was found as 0.844. Before application of the “Power Electronics Course Achievement Test” there was not a significant difference in total scores of both daytime and evening education students. Although students received Web-Based Education and Web Aided Education were selected as experimental group, the students received “Traditional Education” were selected as control group. After the application, significant differences between the total grade points of both experimental and control groups of daytime education and evening education students were detected. © 2018

AB  - This paper presents an adjacent feeders search based method for service restoration of distribution systems after single faults. The developed algorithm makes a search for sections that belong to adjacent feeders and comply with two conditions: have normally open equipment installed or have a three or more derivations. As soon as the sections are selected, an exhaustive search is executed to achieve the restoration plan. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, service restoration on a typical distribution system of Taiwan Power Company is applied. The results are compared with others approaches and show that the proposed method can provide a restoration plan very efficiently even under different load levels. © 2003-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We report the development of a multichannel microscopy for whole-slide multiplane, multispectral and phase imaging. We use trinocular heads to split the beam path into 6 independent channels and employ a camera array for parallel data acquisition, achieving a maximum data throughput of approximately 1 gigapixel per second. To perform single-frame rapid autofocusing, we place 2 near-infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at the back focal plane of the condenser lens to illuminate the sample from 2 different incident angles. A hot mirror is used to direct the near-infrared light to an autofocusing camera. For multiplane whole-slide imaging (WSI), we acquire 6 different focal planes of a thick specimen simultaneously. For multispectral WSI, we relay the 6 independent image planes to the same focal position and simultaneously acquire information at 6 spectral bands. For whole-slide phase imaging, we acquire images at 3 focal positions simultaneously and use the transport-of-intensity equation to recover the phase information. We also provide an open-source design to further increase the number of channels from 6 to 15. The reported platform provides a simple solution for multiplexed fluorescence imaging and multimodal WSI. Acquiring an instant focal stack without z-scanning may also enable fast 3-dimensional dynamic tracking of various biological samples. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - We propose a new application of inexpensive light-emitting diode (LED)-based Sun photometers, consisting of measuring the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with high resolution within metropolitan scales. Previously, these instruments have been used at continental scales by the GLOBE program, but this extension is already covered by more expensive and higher-precision instruments of the AERONET global network. For this we built an open source two-channeled LED-based Sun photometer based on previous developments, with improvements in the hardware, software, and modifications on the calibration procedure. Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564 nm and 0.009 at the 408 nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15 km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others. ©2017.

AB  - In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This article illustrates how to evaluate platform design for an open source hardware development project. First, we will look at the open source hardware development as a methodology that fulfills demands for mass customization. In the open source hardware development, project owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources. Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs. Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers' participation is one of the key factors in successful project management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation. © 2018 International Journal of Industrial Engineering.

AB  - The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of makers that actively share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and re-distributed. Numerous authors have proposed distinct ways to seize this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: enabling scholars to explore scientific concepts, promoting students' creativity, helping them to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, and so on. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the literature on open-source hardware in education by analyzing and classifying 676 publications. The results of our work provide: 1) guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant papers, publication sources, institutions, and countries); 2) information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing its main educational goals, stages, and topics where it is principally applied); and 3) directions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.

AB  - A program library for use on open-source hardware was developed in order to construct a low-cost environmental control system for greenhouses. The library facilitated the development of environmental sensing and control devices that conform to the protocols of the Ubiquitous Environment Control System (UECS). The open-source hardware used was the “Arduino Ethernet” and the “Arduino Mega 2560 with Ethernet Shield” microcontroller boards. UECS is a system for controlling greenhouse environments that communicates information via a local area network, and devices utilizing the library that we developed can perform the UECS defined communication tasks automatically. With the help of this library, device developers no longer need to program the communications aspects of the device and can concentrate on programming setting and control logic of the device. The library occupies about 29 kilobytes of the read only memory area of the target board. The library and associated open-source microcontroller boards are powerful tools for developing low-cost environmental control systems. © 2018 Biotron Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper discusses how emerging issues in housing construction could revolutionise the building industry. It focuses on commons-based networks of organisations, technologies and users that form a niche practice on the margins of the dominant paradigm. This practice can be understood as "Design Global, Manufacture Local" and is exemplified by the Hexayurt, the Open Source Ecology Microhouse and the WikiHouse. Using these descriptive case studies, light is shed on the challenges and opportunities of open construction systems with regard to technological, institutional and social perspectives. Notwithstanding the positive dynamics, certain issues need to be addressed, so that a sustainable built environment could flourish. © 2018, Tamkang University.

AB  - Open-source hardware (OSHW), as low-cost and easy-to-use instrumentations, are particularly suited to the needs of the conservation field. This paper presents two OSHWs developed for the diagnosis of heritage metal artefacts. The DiscoveryMat application allows the qualitative analysis of slightly oxidised metals such as copper and aluminium-based alloys, through the standardized monitoring of the variation of their corrosion potential (Ecorr) with time. The Pleco allows the local identification of corrosion products through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots and this contributes to a better adjustment of conservation treatments on metal artefacts covered with heterogeneous corrosion layers through the selective intervention on some corrosion products and the preservation of others. If the Pleco can already be found in the toolbox of some conservation professionals, the DiscoveryMat application is still in its infancy and needs to be developed in the future as a participatory tool. © 2018, Research Trend.

AB  - Open source design (OSD) is an emerging cluster design mode based on Internet, and it takes full advantage of knowledge, technology, and resources among designers to promote product development. In this mode, designers' behaviors of collaboration have important influence on product development process. In this paper, firstly collaboration flow including two types of collaboration relations between designers in open source design is depicted. Secondly, two-phase collaborative behavior model including partner selection and response is built by means of utility functions. At last, simulation experiment including 4 scenarios is designed based on open source project of mobile phone and conducted by multiagent simulation, and contrastive analysis is carried out to study collaboration behaviors' impact on open source design process. The results show that the two-phase collaborative behavior model elaborately describes structure evolution of Open Source Community (OSC) as well as designers' collaboration behaviors and that different ways of partner selection behaviors have significant impact on the evolution of OSD process as well as OSC structure. Furthermore, the results suggest that designers should better consider more the factor of matching degree between designers but less collaboration record. © 2018 Shuo Zhang and Yingzi Li.

AB  - A humanoid head robot system with some specific expression was comprehensively modelled in this paper by interactive visual expression analysis between the operator and the robot. Firstly, based on the open source hardware of Fritz humanoid head robot, an integrated emotional expression mapping model was proposed by extending the functional module of voice, vision and so on. Secondly, to achieve a natural interaction between the expression robot and the operator, the integrated visual analysis is mainly utilised for emotion calculation. Haar-like featured cascade classified algorithm is utilised for automatic face location. Gabor feature is filtered and down-sampled as the emotional expression feature. To deal with unreasonable samples distribution in traditional eigenface, an optimised eigenvectors’s selection is built by comparing projection reconstructed images with original image. Finally, the classification of with-in class PCA with energy dimension is served as expression recognition. The experimental results on JAFFE database and real-time video image demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modelling scheme. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Water removal is an essential step during crude oil production due to several problems such as increased transportation costs and high corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm−2), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm−2). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsification in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an implementation method for a 2-DOF pendulum control system that is robust against actuator uncertainties. In order to guarantee the robustness against the uncertainty of the actuator, we derive a model in which the robot body’s acceleration is the system’s control input. We then verify its validity by implementing a 2-DOF pendulum system using an omni-directional robot(ODR). The 2-DOF pendulum system can be stabilized without a mathematical model of the actuator in the proposed method. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate uncertainty in the actuator parameters. Furthermore, the method provides the advantages of flexible selection of motors used as actuators. First, we design a mechanical part to measure the angular velocity of the motor and to measure the inclination of an inverted pendulum. Second, we derive a mathematical model of a 2-DOF pendulum system for acceleration which the control input. The controller adopts the Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) to obtain the acceleration required for stabilization. The determined acceleration is converted to the velocity references of wheels through integration and transformation. The velocity references are followed through PI-velocity controllers. Third, the control system is implemented using the open source hardware Nucleo-32 F303K8 board. We illustrate the proposed control system’s effectiveness through stabilization experiments.

AB  - The aging level of labor force in Korea is evaluated based on the percentage of workers above the age of 50 in the economically active population. While the percentage of elderly population was 25% in 2000 it is projected that it will reach 40% in 2020 and exceed 50% in 2050. The rapid increase of elderly population is leading to the decrease of productive population. It will also cause an aggravation of domestic productivity. Productivity decline due to the increase of elderly population can become visible within a few years. Information communication technology is finding ways to respond to this problem. Smart technology can enhance productivity through automation and intellectualization in a simple and repetitive labor field. Among smart technologies, the development of IoT technology has been carried out actively. Many examples that can increase productivity using IoT have been suggested widely. This study will describe the development of IoT using open source software and hardware that can minimize the development time of IoT technology. With examples of applying IoT technology to home automation for the development of a similar system in the future, this study seeks to suggest that productivity improvement using IoT communication to solve the problems of the decrease in productive population and productivity decline. In order to show that the issue of productivity decline due to aging can be solved using open source technology, this study suggested a direction by developing home automation using open source hardware and software. © 2018, Medwell Journals.

AB  - The 'open approach' is rooted in the open-source and free-software movements. Its application has spread to more fields than computer engineering. Product design is impacted as well: we observe new stakeholders and practices challenging current structured design processes and leading to industrial successes. Open-design appears to be promising yet disruptive. Moreover, its distinctive features remain unclear. This paper aims to popularize this new concept, as well as to give both researchers and practitioners an overview of current research on open-design, and its consequences on design. For this, we conducted a systematic quantitative bibliometric analysis of 624 entries corresponding to the keyword 'open-design' in the Scopus database. This supports a qualitative synthesis of scientific literature, enabling us to summarize practices falling under the umbrella term 'open-design'. As such, this paper traces the evolution of product design and the open approach. It also analyzes the impact of open-design on the design process as presented in the scientific literature. Finally, this paper develops a typology of open-design of tangible artifacts that distinguishes among three currently reported varieties of practice: do-it-yourself, meta-design, and industrial ecosystems. As the major contribution of this paper, this typology is developed as a final discussion. © The Author(s) 2018 Distributed as Open Access under a CC-BY 4.0 license.

AB  - The development and deployment of a complete photogate system (hardware + software) to be used in physics learning laboratories is described. Different approaches found in the literature are conjugated in a configuration that offers good time resolution (≈ 1 ms), high number of independent optical gates (up to six channels), high sensibility (digital-analog conversion up to 10 bits), low cost (open or free hardware and software) and easy assembly. The system was probed for three classic physics learning experiments: (i) inclined plane, (ii) viscosimeter and (iii) simple pendulum. We believe that the described tools can help to improve the learning physics laboratories autonomy and infrastructure, engaging stronger project designs with quality and versatility as good as the commercial options.

AB  - The rapid development of Arduino open-source hardware platform-based projects has been reported for STEM education. However, it is rare to see this kind of very low-cost data acquisition (DAQ) system in science education, where it might replace expensive commercial devices. These modular, constructed DAQs can be highly customisable to meet teacher needs. In a pilot project, such devices were introduced to university students learning to become elementary school science teachers. The potential for such devices to replace currently used commercial DAQs was examined, as well as the attitude of the students to this equipment. Focus was on the Arduino-based platform, which can operate in two different modes as a standalone data-logger device or as a DAQ connected to a computer with full data visualisation. All items of equipment developed were Arduino do it yourself (DIY) devices published on the GitHub portal, where they are freely available with support and examples. © 2018 WIETE.

AB  - Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios—low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)—demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Radar is an electronic device which utilizes electromagnetic waves to determine the altitude, range, direction, or speed of both moving and immovable objects. In contrast, ultrasonic waves are used instead of electromagnetic waves in ultrasonic radar. The low power consumption, low cost and ease of implementation are considered the main features of the ultrasonic radar to be devoted in several applications such as security purposes, object detection and avoidance systems in robotics. This work presents a design and implementation of ultrasonic radar for distance measurements. The design consists of an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino board as a controller, a servo motor and a java application. The detection range of the proposed system is tested up to 500 cm with the angle of rotation from (0 to +180) and (180 to 0) degrees for different types of obstacles or objects (sponge, wood an aluminum). The design is built using open source hardware (Arduino Uno 328) which is coded via Micro C environment as a software entity. The effectiveness of the proposed design is measured using a statistical analysis of the distance error between the radar and the obstacles. The results obtained for all types of obstacles are tabled and graphed to prove that a very small error can be achieved using the proposed design. © 2018 Haraa Raheem Hatem et. al.

AB  - The ever-increasing flood of information, especially in the medical-clinical field, inter alia due to the increase of data-intensive mobile/wearable devices, is one of the biggest challenges of medical informatics. In this work different possibilities of the integration of wearable devices on the example of the development of a fall prevention system are presented and classified. We started with a commercial off-the-shelf one-on-one system (Shimmer/Arduino) using a Bluetooth connection, integrated via nurse call system as Human-Machine-Interface. During the evaluation of the system we mentioned several new requirements and optimization possibilities. Thus, we adjusted the hardware-software-system; the near-field communication was realized by IEEE802.15.4, we replaced commercial off-the-shelf devices with highly-specialized open hardware in-house developments and we transferred the nurse call integration by setting up our own network and integrating this into an existing (wireless) local area network. With this development, the energy-efficient, simple and intuitive mechanisms of proximity communication via IEEE802.15.4 can be combined with the benefits broadband functionalities, e.g. of Wi-Fi, with both worlds benefits and the compensation of some disadvantages. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8WPV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W/m2. An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices. © 2018 International Journal of Thermodynamics.

AB  - Modern ultrasonic phased-array controllers are electronic systems capable of delaying the transmitted or received signals of multiple transducers. Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However, emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and π/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17–0.63% (0.05–0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65–9.38% (2.15–3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes’ jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population. © 2018, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

AB  - Earthquake effects are strongly related with the properties of the local geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - About 90.3% of nurses reported to have experienced with sharp injuries and about 37.6% of nurses occurred more than one time of sharp injuries by opening the glass ampoules during recent 6 months. The sharp, jagged edges formed when the ampoule neck breaks incompletely pose a serious danger to medical professionals. Literatures reviewing showed that situation of sharps injuries by opening ampoule wasn't improved yet. Further, it needed to research and solve the problem. Thus, present study developed the new ampoule opener by systematic innovation of user-centered design to avoid painful and dangerous sharps injuries. User needs analysis have been conducted from district hospital, regional hospital and medical center medical center. A questionnaire was used to survey the behaviors (tasks of opening ampoule, types of ampoules, user requirements etc.) and sharp injuries while opening glass ampoules. After analyzing patents search, user needs analysis and results of questionnaire survey, present study designed and built the prototype of ampoule opener. Results of ergonomic evaluation showed that applied the ampoule opener had lower EMG activity of forearm and lower ulnar deviation on wrist. This easy-to-use multi-use ampoule opener avoids the unacceptable sharps injury rates seen when ampoules are opened by hand. The findings of this study could provide references to medical personnel in order to prevent and decrease sharp injuries as much as possible. In clinical effectiveness will be further assessed. © 2018 Society of Sytematic Innovation.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to answer the following two questions: What are the influences of the top managers’ different leadership styles on organizational innovation? What is the mechanism by which the different leaderships exert different effects on organizational innovation? Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypothesized model, a data set based on 133 MBA part-time students from Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University in China was built, after interviewing several top managers as a pilot study. With the help of SPSS macro, hierarchical regression and bootstrapping analysis, the paper analyzes the effects of two leadership styles on innovation performance, through the mediation mechanism of openness involving open breadth and open depth. Findings: The results indicate that transformational leadership enhances, while transactional leadership reduces, the organizational innovation performance. The openness breadth and openness depth not only mediate the beneficial effect of transformational leadership on innovation, but also mediate the deleterious effect of transactional leadership on innovation. Originality/value: This study empirically explores the different functions of transformational leadership and transactional leadership for leading organizational innovation performance. Furthermore, a new form of organization is an open design or strategy that allows more external knowledge and resources to be absorbed, which is claimed as a new paradigm for organization innovation. This study integrates the concepts of breadth of openness and depth of openness on the basis of open innovation literature, as an intermediate mechanism to explain the different effects of the two forms of top managers’ leadership. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background In patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) two open pilot studies about the effects of 35% carbon dioxide (CO2) exist. One shows an augmented panicogenic and anxiogenic response (Muhtz et al., 2011), the other does not (Talesnik et al. 2007). We further characterized the CO2 reactivity in PTSD using for the first time placebo-controlled and double-blind conditions. Methods In 20 patients with PTSD we assessed panic, anxiety, dissociative and PTSD symptoms after a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO2 compared to a placebo gas condition in a within-participant cross-over, placebo-controlled, double-blind and randomized design. Results Inhalation of 35% CO2 versus placebo provoked significantly increased panic, anxiety, dissociative and PTSD symptoms. The reaction to placebo gas was minimal. Order of inhalation, patients' sex or age did not influence the results. The panic and anxiety response under CO2 was considerably higher in the PTSD patients than in healthy controls from our previous open study. Conclusions The results corroborate that our preceding findings of an increased CO2 reactivity in patients with PTSD are not false positive due to the open design or the lack of placebo control. Replication in a larger number of PTSD patients and matched control subjects is needed. The potential role of childhood traumatisation, psychiatric comorbidity, psychotropic medication and trait dissociation in prior contradictory reports should be clarified. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The COPD Patient Management European Trial (COMET) investigated the efficacy and safety of a home-based COPD disease management intervention for severe COPD patients. The study was an international open-design clinical trial in COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s <50% of predicted value) randomised 1:1 to the disease management intervention or to the usual management practices at the study centre. The disease management intervention included a self-management programme, home telemonitoring, care coordination and medical management. The primary end-point was the number of unplanned all-cause hospitalisation days in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary end-points included acute care hospitalisation days, BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise) index and exacerbations. Safety end-points included adverse events and deaths. For the 157 (disease management) and 162 (usual management) patients eligible for ITT analyses, all-cause hospitalisation days per year (mean±SD) were 17.4±35.4 and 22.6±41.8, respectively (mean difference −5.3, 95% CI −13.7 to −3.1; p=0.16). The disease management group had fewer per-protocol acute care hospitalisation days per year (p=0.047), a lower BODE index (p=0.01) and a lower mortality rate (1.9% versus 14.2%; p<0.001), with no difference in exacerbation frequency. Patient profiles and hospitalisation practices varied substantially across countries. The COMET disease management intervention did not significantly reduce unplanned all-cause hospitalisation days, but reduced acute care hospitalisation days and mortality in severe COPD patients.

AB  - The importance of quality of the measured values is very dependent on the device that measures these values: the size of the sample, the time of measurement, periods of measurement, the mobility and the robustness of the device, etc. Contemporary devices intended for the measurement of physical quantities that are on the market vary in price, as well as and the quality of the measured values. The rule "the more expensive the better" is not necessarily always a rule that is valid because it all depends on the characteristics and capabilities of the device, and the customer's needs. In this paper, a device based on "Open Source" components of hardware and software will be presented. Device was used to measure voltages and currents on low voltage networks, on which a virtually unlimited number of sensors can be added, and the device is assembled of components available on electronic components Internet.

AB  - Excluding the ion source, an ion mobility spectrometer is fundamentally comprised of drift chamber, ion gate, pulsing electronics, and a mechanism for amplifying and recording ion signals. Historically, the solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled, MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output of this circuit follows a TTL signal with ~20 ns rise and fall times, pulses up to +/− 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental efforts for future comparison. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems have improved aesthetics but generally cost far more than conventional PV systems because of small manufacturing scale. Thus, in the short and medium term, there is a need for a BIPV mounting system that utilizes conventional modules. Such a design is provided here with a novel modification of conventional photovoltaic (PV) modules to allow them to act as BIPV roofing slates. The open-source designs for the mechanical components necessary to provide the post-consumer conversion for a conventional PV module are provided, and prototypes are fabricated and installed on a mock roof system along with control modules mounted conventionally. The approximately U.S.$22/module BIPV roof-mounted system is direct mounted on the roof to eliminate the need for roofing shingles or other coverings, which effectively provides a 20% total cost reduction from conventional racking systems that demand a roof to mount upon without considering the savings from the rack itself. The results of the outdoor system testing found no water leaks. An increased operating temperature was observed, which would reduce the output from a silicon-based PV module by less than 10%. The results found significant potential for this design to further reduce total PV systems costs. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper draws on a strategy-as-practice perspective to examine the articulation of agenda setting, a key activity important for both strategy meetings and open strategy. Our research target is the 9th National Science and Technology Conference held by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan in 2012. The conference is nationwide, regularly organized, and has an open design, highlighting the importance of setting agendas skillfully to build consensus and guide action. Using qualitative-based action research procedures, we develop three strategy tools for the design and delivery of agenda setting. These include problematizing, futurizing, and corresponding. We also point out moralizing as a moderator for such a strategic and creative process. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for strategy workshops, strategy practices, and open strategy. © 2017, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

AB  - We have conceived, built, and operated a cryogenic Penning trap with an electrically conducting yet optically transparent solid electrode. The trap, dedicated to spectroscopy and imaging of confined particles under large solid angles, is of "half-open" design with one open endcap and one closed endcap that mainly consists of a glass window coated with a highly transparent conductive layer. This arrangement allows for the trapping of externally or internally produced particles and yields flexible access for optical excitation and efficient light collection from the trapping region. At the same time, it is electrically closed and ensures long-term ion confinement under well-defined conditions. With its superior surface quality and its high as well as homogeneous optical transmission, the window electrode is an excellent replacement for partially transmissive electrodes that use holes, slits, metallic meshes, and the like. © 2017 Author(s).

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does an increased FSH dose result in higher cumulative live birth rates in women with a predicted poor ovarian response, apparent from a low antral follicle count (AFC), scheduled for IVF or ICSI? SUMMARY ANSWER: In women with a predicted poor ovarian response (AFC < 11) undergoing IVF/ICSI, an increased FSH dose (225/ 450 IU/day) does not improve cumulative live birth rates as compared to a standard dose (150 IU/day). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In women scheduled for IVF/ICSI, an ovarian reserve test (ORT) can predict ovarian response to stimulation. The FSH starting dose is often adjusted based on the ORT from the belief that it will improve live birth rates. However, the existing RCTs on this topic, most of which show no benefit, are underpowered. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between May 2011 and May 2014, we performed an open-label multicentre RCT in women with an AFC < 11 (Dutch Trial Register NTR2657). The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy achieved within 18 months after randomization and resulting in a live birth. We needed 300 women to assess whether an increased dose strategy would increase the cumulative live birth rate from 25 to 40% (two-sided alpha-error 0.05, power 80%). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with an AFC ≤ 7 were randomized to an FSH dose of 450 IU/day or 150 IU/day, and women with an AFC 8–10 were randomized to 225 IU or 150 IU/day. In the standard group, dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles based on pre-specified criteria. Both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the strategies were evaluated from an intention-to-treat perspective. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 511 women were randomized, 234 with an AFC ≤ 7 and 277 with an AFC 8–10. The cumulative live birth rate for increased versus standard dosing was 42.4% (106/250) versus 44.8% (117/261), respectively [relative risk (RR): 0.95 (95%CI, 0.78–1.15), P = 0.58]. As an increased dose strategy was more expensive [delta costs/woman: €1099 (95%CI, 562–1591)], standard FSH dosing was the dominant strategy in our economic analysis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite our training programme, the AFC might have suffered from inter-observer variation. As this open study permitted small dose adjustments between cycles, potential selective cancelling of cycles in women treated with 150 IU could have influenced the cumulative results. However, since first cycle live birth rates point in the same direction we consider it unlikely that the open design masked a potential benefit for the individualized strategy. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Since an increased dose in women scheduled for IVF/ICSI with a predicted poor response (AFC < 11) does not improve live birth rates and is more expensive, we recommend using a standard dose of 150 IU/day in these women.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Is there a difference in live birth rate and/or cost-effectiveness between antral follicle count (AFC)-based individualized FSH dosing or standard FSH dosing in women starting IVF or ICSI treatment? SUMMARY ANSWER: In women initiating IVF/ICSI, AFC-based individualized FSH dosing does not improve live birth rates or reduce costs as compared to a standard FSH dose. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In IVF or ICSI, ovarian reserve testing is often used to adjust the FSH dose in order to normalize ovarian response and optimize live birth rates. However, no robust evidence for the (cost-)effectiveness of this practice exists. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between May 2011 and May 2014 we performed a multicentre prospective cohort study with two embedded RCTs in women scheduled for IVF/ICSI. Based on the AFC, women entered into one of the two RCTs (RCT1: AFC < 11; RCT2: AFC > 15) or the cohort (AFC 11-15). The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy achieved within 18 months after randomization. resulting in a live birth (delivery of at least one live foetus after 24 weeks of gestation). Data from the cohort with weight 0.5 were combined with both RCTs in order to conduct a strategy analysis. Potential half-integer numbers were rounded up. Differences in costs and effects between the two treatment strategies were compared by bootstrapping. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In both RCTs women were randomized to an individualized (RCT1:450/ 225 IU, RCT2:100 IU) or standard FSH dose (150 IU). Women in the cohort all received the standard dose (150 IU). Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) was measured to assess AMH post-hoc as a biomarker to individualize treatment. For RCT1 dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles based on pre-specified criteria in the standard group only. For RCT2 dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles in both groups. Both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the strategies were evaluated from an intention-to-treat perspective. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We included 1515 women, of whom 483 (31.9%) entered the cohort, 511 (33.7%) RCT1 and 521 (34.4%) RCT2. Live births occurred in 420/747 (56.3%) women in the individualized strategy and 447/769 (58.2%) women in the standard strategy (risk difference -0.019 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02), P = 0.39; a total of 1516 women due to rounding up the half integer numbers). The individualized strategy was more expensive (delta costs/woman = €275 (95% CI, 40 to 499)). Individualized dosing reduced the occurrence of mild and moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and subsequently the costs for management of these OHSS categories (costs saved/woman were €35). The analysis based on AMH as a tool for dose individualization suggested comparable results. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite a training programme, the AFC might have suffered from inter-observer variation. In addition, although strict cancel criteria were provided, selective cancelling in the individualized dose group (for poor response in particular) cannot be excluded as observers were not blinded for the FSH dose and small dose adjustments were allowed in subsequent cycles. However, as both first cycle live birth rates and cumulative live birth rates show no difference between strategies, the open design probably did not mask a potential benefit for the individualized group. Despite increasing consensus on using GnRH antagonist co-treatment in women predicted for a hyper response in particular, GnRH agonists were used in almost 80% of the women in this study. Hence, in those women, the AFC and bloodsampling for the post-hoc AMH analysis were performed during pituitary suppression. As the correlation between AFC and ovarian response is not compromised during GnRH agonist use, this will probably not have influenced classification of response. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Individualized FSH dosing for the IVF/ICSI population as a whole should not be pursued as it does not improve live birth rates and it increases costs. Women scheduled for IVF/ICSI with a regular menstrual cycle are therefore recommended a standard FSH starting dose of 150 IU per day. Still, safety management by individualized dosing in predicted hyper responders is open for further research. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Study Question: Does a reduced FSH dose in women with a predicted hyper response, apparent from a high antral follicle count (AFC), who are scheduled for IVF/ICSI lead to a different outcome with respect to cumulative live birth rate and safety? Summary Answer: Although in women with a predicted hyper response (AFC > 15) undergoing IVF/ICSI a reduced FSH dose (100 IU per day) results in similar cumulative live birth rates and a lower occurrence of any grade of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as compared to a standard dose (150 IU/day), a higher first cycle cancellation rate and similar severe OHSS rate were observed. What is Known Already: Excessive ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for IVF/ICSI may result in increased rates of cycle cancellation, the occurrence of OHSS and suboptimal live birth rates. In women scheduled for IVF/ICSI, an ovarian reserve test (ORT) can be used to predict response to COS. No consensus has been reached on whether ORT-based FSH dosing improves effectiveness and safety in women with a predicted hyper response. Study Design Size, Duration: Between May 2011 and May 2014, we performed an open-label, multicentre RCT in women with regular menstrual cycles and an AFC > 15. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (Rotterdam criteria) were excluded. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy achieved within 18 months after randomization and resulting in a live birth. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of OHSS and cost-effectiveness. Since this RCT was embedded in a cohort study assessing over 1500 women, we expected to randomize 300 predicted hyper responders. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: Women with an AFC > 15 were randomized to an FSH dose of 100 IU or 150 IU/day. In both groups, dose adjustment was allowed in subsequent cycles (maximum 25 IU in the reduced and 50 IU in the standard group) based on pre-specified criteria. Both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were evaluated from an intention-to-treat perspective. Main Results and the Role of Chance: We randomized 255 women to a daily FSH dose of 100 IU and 266 women to a daily FSH dose of 150 IU. The cumulative live birth rate was 66.3% (169/255) in the reduced versus 69.5% (185/266) in the standard group (relative risk (RR) 0.95 [95%CI, 0.85-1.07], P = 0.423). The occurrence of any grade of OHSS was lower after a lower FSH dose (5.2% versus 11.8%, RR 0.44 [95%CI, 0.28-0.71], P = 0.001), but the occurrence of severe OHSS did not differ (1.3% versus 1.1%, RR 1.25 [95%CI, 0.38-4.07], P = 0.728). As dose reduction was not less expensive (£4.622 versus £4.714, delta costs/woman £92 [95%CI, -479-325]), there was no dominant strategy in the economic analysis. Limitations, Reasons for Caution: Despite our training programme, the AFC might have suffered from inter-observer variation. Although strict cancellation criteria were provided, selective cancelling in the reduced dose group (for poor response in particular) cannot be excluded as observers were not blinded for the FSH dose and small dose adjustments were allowed in subsequent cycles. However, as first cycle live birth rates did not differ from the cumulative results, the open design probably did not mask a potential benefit for the reduced dosing group. As this RCT was embedded in a larger cohort study, the power in this study was unavoidably lower than it should be. Participants had a relatively low BMI from an international perspective, which may limit generalization of the findings. Wider Implications of the Findings: In women with a predicted hyper response scheduled for IVF/ICSI, a reduced FSH dose does not affect live birth rates. A lower FSH dose did reduce the incidence of mild and moderate OHSS, but had no impact on severe OHSS. Future research into ORT-based dosing in women with a predicted hyper response should compare various safety management strategies and should be powered on a clinically relevant safety outcome while assessing non-inferiority towards live birth rates.

AB  - Active chlorophyll a fluorescence is an essential tool for understanding photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses. Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (σPSII or σPSII'). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 μmol photons m-2s-1) and high (200 μmol photons m-2 s-1) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell-1 decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research. © © 2017 Hoadley and Warner.

AB  - Background: The ability to make objective measurements of physical activity in dogs has both clinical and research applications. Accelerometers offer a non-intrusive and convenient solution. Of the commercialy available sensors, measurements are commonly given in manufacturer bespoke units and calculated with closed source approaches. Furthermore, the validation studies that exist for such devices are mounting location dependant, not transferable between brands or not suitable for handling modern raw accelerometry type data. Methods: This paper describes a validation study of n = 5 where 4 sensors were placed on each dog; 2 on a harness and 2 on a collar. Each position held two sensors from different manufacturers; Actigraph (which has previously been validated for use on the collar) and VetSens (which provides un-filtered accelerometry data). The aims of the study was to firstly evaluate the performance of an open-design method of converting raw accelerometry data into units that have previously been validated. Secondly, comparison was made between sensors mounted at each location for determining physical activity state. Results: Once the raw actigraphy data had been processed with the open-design method, results from a 7 day measurement revealed no significant difference in physical activity estimates via a cutpoint approach between the sensor manufacturers. A second finding was a low inter-site variability between the ventral collar and dorsal harness locations (Pearsons r2 = 0.96). Conclusions: Using the open-design methodology, raw, un-filtered data from the VetSens sensors can be compared or pooled with data gathered from Actigraph sensors. The results also provide strong evidence that ventral collar and dorsal harness sites may be used interchangeably. This enables studies to be designed with a larger inclusion criteria (encompassing dogs that are not well suited for wearing an instrumented collar) and ensures high levels of welfare while maintaining measurement validity. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The business models of digital maker-entrepreneurs in open design are inextricably linked to the broader open design community. Digital makers share designs on online platforms such as Thingiverse and use digital manufacturing technology such as 3-D printing as a generative mechanism for their entrepreneurial activities. There is a general understanding of how sharing works in that community and the basic design parameters that determine the business models of these digital maker-entrepreneurs, which are based on a portfolio of activities. This study is based on in-depth interviews with 11 digital maker-entrepreneurs from the open design community. We investigate the activities that constitute their business models using activity theory as a lens with which better to understand them. This study provides a perspective on the complexity of the relationships in which these activities are embedded and analyzes the activities related to the production, distribution, and consumption of value. Finally, we examine the exchanges between digital maker-entrepreneurs in the community, shedding light on how digital maker-entrepreneurs share and exchange goods, services, and knowledge as peers. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

AB  - The advent of easy-to-use open source microcontrollers, off-the-shelf electronics and customizable manufacturing technologies has facilitated the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory equipment. In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering.

AB  - The race to achieve smart cities is producing a continuous effort to adapt new developments and knowledge, for administrations and citizens. Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite its long history of technological development, much charcoal production still relies on polluting and inefficient technologies utilizing traditional kiln designs. In addition to the need for improved charcoal production systems, the growing interest globally in pyrolysis of biomass to generate biochar as a soil fertility improver and for climate change mitigation may drive an increasing demand for such technologies. Accordingly, there is a clear need in developing countries for access to safe, affordable, and efficient open-source designs and technology that can be fabricated locally. The design described here includes computational fluid dynamics modeling which demonstrated that the design exhibits a stable flow and combustion pattern. A hazard and operability (HAZOP) study, mass and energy modeling, and costing of all components and fabrication were also conducted for a prototype kiln that will accept up to 250 kg biomass h-1. Fabrication and installation costs were estimated using actual commercial quotations based on detailed engineering drawings and design, and were found to be $580 000 for a 250 kg h-1 unit. We therefore find that this pyrolysis system promises to be economical on a small scale. It can utilize waste lignocellulosic materials for feedstock, thus alleviating demand pressure on woodlands to provide feedstocks. It was, therefore, concluded that the pyrolysis unit described here promises to provide an affordable and efficient open-source design that can be fabricated locally in developing countries without licensing restrictions or royalties. © 2017 The Authors Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining published by Society of Industrial Chemistry and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. © 2017 The Authors Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining published by Society of Industrial Chemistry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This article describes a complete characterization system for photovoltaic devices designed to acquire the current-voltage curve and to process the obtained data. The proposed system can be replicated for educational or research purposes without having wide knowledge about electronic engineering. Using standard calibrated instrumentation, commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing the results obtained from some commercial photovoltaic modules to the measurements given by an independently accredited laboratory. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - A laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was used as a complimentary detection system for time-of-flight ion mobility spectrometry (TOF-IMS). A LIF detection system is potentially faster than a conventional electrometer detector and can provide additional (to usual for IMS drift time) analytical information, namely wavelength of fluorescence maxima and fluorescence lifetime. Therefore, better discrimination ability can be expected. Additionally, the combination of IMS and LIF operates at atmospheric pressure. This allows fluorescence measurements of specified ions and ion clusters, which would not survive in a mass spectrometer. An IMS drift cell of open design with both the electrometer and LIF detectors was designed. The feasibility of IMS-LIF was demonstrated on the example of the Xanthene dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G). Electrospray was used as an ionization source. The release and desolvation of R6G ions from the electrospray with following IMS-LIF analysis were demonstrated. The effects of experimental parameters (e.g., ion gate and drift voltages, distance to ESI emitter) are demonstrated and discussed. The obtained results are promising enough to ensure the potential of LIF as a complimentary/alternative detection system for time-of-flight ion mobility spectrometry. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Arduino boards, a current trending open-source platform technology, are being used by museums and other institutions to create interactive exhibits for their patrons. Academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of finding new inspirations to educate and engage patrons. The Illuminated Lifestyles exhibit at Binghamton University was an attempt to teach library users about the sensory experiences of medieval manuscripts using touch technology. Relatively inexpensive, these boards can be incorporated in various ways to make an exhibit interactive. In this case, the boards were used in conjunction with large-scale frames covered with digitized replicas of manuscript leaves that spoke to the viewer as they touched the images. This case study explains the technology and platforms used within the exhibit and what the long-term impacts and benefits, if any, the library experienced. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Kristen Gallant and Juan Denzer.

AB  - This letter presents the depth control of an autonomous micro diving agent called autonomous diving agent (ADA). ADA consists of off-The-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware. It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks.We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This article describes the design of a low-cost USB-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat which can measure or apply potentials in the range of ±8 V, and measure or apply currents ranging from nanoamps to max. ±25 mA. Precision is excellent thanks to the on-board 20-bit D/A-convertor and 22-bit A/D-convertors. The dual control modes and its wide potential range make it especially suitable for battery characterization. As an example use case, measurements are presented on a lithium-ion test cell using thin-film anatase TiO2 as the working electrode. A cross-platform Python program may be used to run electrochemical experiments within an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Designed with an open hardware philosophy and using open-source tools, all the details of the project (including the schematic, PCB design, microcontroller firmware, and host computer software) are freely available, making custom modifications of the design straightforward. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - A programmable optical stimulator for Drosophila eyes is presented. The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 °C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The research was conducted at ICAR-Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow, India, to study the effect of different types of furrow opener at different depth and speed of operation on soil penetration resistance, ridge height, specific draft, soil disturbance and germination percentage and to select the best furrow opener for establishment of sugarcane crop. The field experiment was conducted on a silt loam textured soil for three furrow openers viz. IISR furrower, IISR deep furrower and conventional type ridger operated at three average forward speed 0.26, 0.40 and 1.02 m s−1 and three average depths of 100, 150 and 250 mm. The parameters such as draft force, specific draft, soil penetration resistance, ridge height, soil disturbed and germination percentage were determined. Soil penetration resistance decreased significantly with increasing operational speeds of each furrow openers and increased significantly with depth of furrows. Soil disturbed and draft force requirements increased significantly with the increase in operation speed and depth of furrow in all the furrow openers. The significantly higher germination percentage after 30 and 45 DAP was observed with IISR deep furrow opener at 250 mm depth. The lowest soil penetration resistance, minimum specific draft and better germination were found with IISR deep furrow opener. © 2016, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

AB  - Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors’ response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the open source development of additive manufacturing has led to low-cost desktop three-dimensional (3-D) printing, a number of scientists throughout the world have begun to share digital designs of free and open source scientific hardware. Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20° platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US $ 37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities. The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In pursuit of coping mechanisms for the challenges of sustainable manufacturing, systematic methods have been developed to allow engineers to improve the ratio between products’ utility and environmental impact. These necessary efforts remain however limited if the surrounding production and consumption practices are not called into question at the same time. This article introduces open source product development as a potential approach for unlocking the limits of existing sustainable product design practices and to lead towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption practices termed as participative production. First, it discusses the potential advantages of this emerging practice in terms of environmental sustainability. Second, it provides a screened qualitative environmental analysis of 18 exemplary open source hardware products. Specific sustainable design principles implemented by these products are highlighted and discussed in order to identify challenges for further common research in the field of open source and sustainable product development. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - 3-D printing has entered the consumer market because of recent radical price declines. Consumers can save substantial money by offsetting purchases with DIY pre-designed 3-D printed products. However, even more value can be obtained with distributed manufacturing using mass customization. Unfortunately, the average consumer is not technically sophisticated enough to easily design their own products. One solution to this is the use of an overlay on OpenSCAD parametric code, although current solutions force users to relinquish all rights to their own designs. There is thus a substantial need in the open source design community for a libre 3-D model customizer, which can be used in any design repository to democratize design. This study reports on the design, function, and validation of such software: the Free Open Source 3-D Customizer. It is demonstrated with a case study of the customization of 3-D printable external breast prosthetics. The results showed that novice users can adjust the available parameters according to their needs and save these to a new file on a website. This PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) library is free and open source and has potential for increasing the usefulness of online repositories to enable distributed manufacturing using consumer customized 3-D printable products. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a data acquisition unit which synchronously samples multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i.e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated. Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid integration with popular numerical simulation environments. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This study analyzes a low-cost reliable real-time optical monitoring platform for fused filament fabrication-based open source 3D printing. An algorithm for reconstructing 3D images from overlapping 2D intensity measurements with relaxed camera positioning requirements is compared with a single-camera solution for single-side 3D printing monitoring. The algorithms are tested for different 3D object geometries and filament colors. The results showed that both of the algorithms with a single- and double-camera system were effective at detecting a clogged nozzle, incomplete project, or loss of filament for a wide range of 3D object geometries and filament colors. The combined approach was the most effective and achieves 100% detection rate for failures. The combined method analyzed here has a better detection rate and a lower cost compared to previous methods. In addition, this method is generalizable to a wide range of 3D printer geometries, which enables further deployment of desktop 3D printing as wasted print time and filament are reduced, thereby improving the economic advantages of distributed manufacturing. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Zebrafish is a vertebrate animal model. Their maintenance in large number under laboratory conditions is a daunting task. Commercially available recirculating zebrafish maintenance systems are used to efficiently handle the tasks of automatic sediment cleaning from zebrafish tanks with minimal waste of water. Due to their compact nature, they also ensure the maximal use of available lab space. However, the high costs of commercial systems present a limitation to researchers with limited funds. A cost-effective zebrafish maintenance system with major features offered by commercially available systems is highly desirable. Here, we describe a compact and recirculating zebrafish maintenance system. Our system is composed of cost-effective components, which are available in local markets and/or can be procured via online vendors. Depending on the expertise of end users, the system can be assembled in 2 days. The system is completely customizable as it offers geometry independent zebrafish tanks that are capable of auto-cleaning the sediments. Due to these features, we called our setup as Open-RAC (Open-design, Recirculating and Auto-Cleaning zebrafish maintenance system). Open-RAC is a cost-effective and viable alternative to the currently available zebrafish maintenance systems. Thus, we believe that the use of Open-RAC could promote the zebrafish research by removing the cost barrier for researchers. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The development and adoption of digital technologies in the past decades has modified existing working conditions and introduced new ones in many fields and disciplines. This process has also influenced the field of Design especially with the Open Design and the Maker movements. The article proposes a software library for analysing networks of social interactions over time on Git projects hosted on GitHub. Such software may be useful for understanding social interactions over time on GitHub, enabling thus an overview of participation in collaborative processes and therefore advance our understanding of how platforms connects and influence makers and designers in their collaborative work on Open Design. The article show its application to three cases of (a) discussing the nature and concepts of Open Design, (b) teaching Open Design to interaction design students, (c) the development of a platform for Maker laboratories and Open Design projects. © 2017 IAAC.

AB  - This paper explores the concept of the circular economy within the context of fashion and textile design in the UK, and does so from the textile and fashion perspectives to explore how this might be achieved. Within the UK alone, we dispose of approximately 10,000 garments every ten minutes (Kerr & Foster, 2011). This project focuses specifically on the practice of textile and fashion design in the UK to consider a more holistic approach for designing and manufacturing within these sectors. Our research aims are to explore the contribution open design can make in implementing the circular economy and thus a more sustainable material future. We ask what are the new models and systems of production that will support a circular economy in textiles? In this work we propose a vision for circular economic models of production in fashion and textiles that adopt open design approaches. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Online platforms (i.e. Instructables) often provide design solutions developed locally for one specific person’s needs. The goal of the research is to understand how existing specific projects, created to be for one person, can be translated into open design solutions that facilitate spontaneous re-appropriation in a variety of new contexts. By observing and interviewing 36 teams of students within a living lab project where occupational therapists and designers co-design personal assistive devices with and for disabled clients, we explored how the relevant design information can be meaningfully reorganized to create open design. We focused on the designers’ choices of concrete attributes with a high impact on the end-result. We suggest a model wherein these attributes are listed and categorized as: Undefined, Defined-Fixed, Contextual, balancing openness and over-design. The research led to a new definition that distinguishes "Open-ended Design" from "Open Design". © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Built upon the definition of social innovation, the umbrella expression “digital social innovation” was introduced to describe a wide range of projects that use digital technologies, community engagement and collaboration, co-creation strategies and bottom-up approaches to solve societal needs, in opposition to the centralized proprietary solutions owned by a few companies. Assessing how digital social innovation projects can scale in order to have a better impact, is crucial to provide a concrete European model to innovation creation that considers values beyond economic factors. This paper presents the results of a one-year training program aimed at supporting the scalability of digital social innovation projects in order to have a better impact. In particular, it describes the application of an open design approach to the design of a P2P mentoring model, and a sustainability toolkit that faces the issue of generating capacity building in emerging community of tech social innovators. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Design Education is changing. Setting out from the awareness that “the profile of design professions need not–and should not–remain what it is today” (Findeli, 2001, p.17) and from insight suggesting that the “experimental approach will become the “normal” approach in our future” (Manzini, 2015, p.54), the authors worked on an articulated programme of collective open design activities reflecting these changes. The activities focus on concrete experimentation on the paradigm of distributed production, which modifies the articulation of known roles and the traditional design education approaches. Therefore, the initiative aims at involving important international design schools in a concrete design exploration of this key issue for society and the design discipline itself. Manzini (2015) urged to “look at the whole of society as a huge laboratory of sociotechnical experimentation”: this practice is a remarkable example which may be used as a model in the future on a larger scale. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Openness is a common feature in the contemporary design field. It may be found in both production and design processes, and enables the ability to spread information, create networks and connect people, skills or companies. In the last few year many new web platforms have based their business model on crowdsourcing, networking and on collective intelligence, envisioning new relations between the customer, the designer and the production system. Today not all of them are still on the market, and others have taken new directions. This paper presents a comparison of the path of three design companies: Opendesk, Quirky and Formabilio. The first company is still flourishing, the second changed its intent in part and the third closed after three years of activity. All these platforms have some points in common: they are design companies, they produce objects, their work is based on using internet and they create networks. The paper seeks to analyze these similarities, as well as the differences between these companies, by focusing the role of design, the methods of production and distribution, and the degree of openness in each of them. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila, or Caenorhabditis elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called ‘FlyPi’. Our design is based on a 3D-printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under €100 and features optional modules for light-emitting diode (LED)-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately €200 or substantially less if the user is prepared to ‘shop around’. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPi’s capabilities, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPi’s utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and research labs. © 2017 Maia Chagas et al.

AB  - As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - We demonstrate continuous high-throughput selective capture of circulating tumor cells by dielectrophoresis at arrays of wireless electrodes (bipolar electrodes, BPEs). The use of BPEs removes the requirement of ohmic contact to individual array elements, thus enabling otherwise unattainable device formats. Capacitive charging of the electrical double layer at opposing ends of each BPE allows an AC electric field to be transmitted across the entire device. Here, two such designs are described and evaluated. In the first design, BPEs interconnect parallel microchannels. Pockets extruding from either side of the microchannels volumetrically control the number of cells captured at each BPE tip and enhance trapping. High-fidelity single-cell capture was achieved when the pocket dimensions were matched to those of the cells. A second, open design allows many non-targeted cells to pass through. These devices enable high-throughput capture of rare cells and single-cell analysis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Most initiatives about embedded sensing capabilities in computational systems lead to devise an ad hoc sensor platform, usually poorly reusable, as a first stage to prepare a data corpus or production prototype. In this paper, an open source hardware platform for sensing is described. This platform was intended to be used in data acquisition for gait identification, and is designed in a way general enough so many other projects could reuse the design to accelerate prototyping. The platform is based on popular open source hardware and software like Arduino and Raspberry Pi using well known languages and libraries. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We describe the implementation of an OPT plate to perform optical projection tomography (OPT) on a commercial wide-field inverted microscope, using our open-source hardware and software. The OPT plate includes a tilt adjustment for alignment and a stepper motor for sample rotation as required by standard projection tomography. Depending on magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed at magnifications ≥4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to ∼1.6 μm). All three methods use the microscope's existing incoherent light source (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for day-to-day use. OPT acquisitions are performed on in vivo zebrafish embryos to demonstrate the implementations' viability. © 2017 Watson et al.

AB  - In this paper, we present a low-cost approach to upgrade an outdated PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) 560 robot in order to widen the number and type of possible hands-on experiments in control and instrumentation education. Another aim of the upgrade is to enable its future connection to a remote laboratory. We propose a scalable structure to control and monitoring PUMA560 motors. This approach combines several different technologies: A Raspberry Pi for control and monitoring, Python to control the system and chart data, as well as converters and drivers with serial I2C bus interface connectivity to read/write data from/to Puma560 robot. The ideas here explained could be applicable to other physical systems with similar characteristics and number of variables. © 2017

AB  - In engineering, traditional approaches aimed at teaching concepts of dynamics to engineering students include the study of a dense yet sequential theoretical development of proofs and exercises. Structural dynamics are seldom taught experimentally in laboratories since these facilities should be provided with expensive equipment such as wave generators, data-acquisition systems, and heavily wired deployments with sensors. In this paper, the design of an experimental experience in the classroom based upon digital fabrication and modeling tools related to structural dynamics is presented. In particular, all experimental deployments are conceived with low-cost, open-source equipment. The hardware includes Arduino-based open-source electronics whereas the software is based upon object-oriented open-source codes for the development of physical simulations. The set of experiments and the physical simulations are reproducible and scalable in classroom-based environments. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Currently, more and more organizations are aware of the increasing potential of nanoscience and nanotechnology, due to the wide field of innovative applications they address from biomedical and molecular technology to semiconductor and material sciences. Nanotechnology is an area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones, cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanœye project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics, software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first functional structure of Nanœye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic Control Demonstrators. © 2017

AB  - Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is increasingly being the choice to strengthen health information systems (HIS) in Low and Middle Income Country (LMIC) contexts. FOSS is becoming a commercially viable option in today's software industry. In LMIC context, bridging the gap between generic open source design and specific local contexts calls for the participation of multi-sector stakeholders to realise FOSS implementations. This multi-sector stakeholder network, together with the FOSS platform can be theorised to form a software ecosystem (SE) around FOSS implementations in a resource constrained setting. In this new paradigm, governing the open source acquisition and implementation process becomes a central challenge, which is distinct from the governance of open source developer communities. This paper attempts to identify the essential stakeholder categories involved in FOSS HIS implementations in a LMIC context and to understand the stakeholder interactions in this SE at different stages. The analysis is based on a longitudinal case study of two open source HIS implementations and an attempt to establish a FOSS governance body in the State health sector of Sri Lanka during the period 2011-2014. The paper contributes by suggesting a model to understand the essential stakeholder categories and their interactions in FOSS implementation SE in resource constrained settings.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the development of a modular open source platform for experimental control setups. This platform emerged from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the form of a modular platform for real-time control. The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing, observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost hardware and free software especially suited for flight control experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware developers and control engineers. © 2017

AB  - Since 2001, the departments of Electrical and Electronics and Information and Communication Electronics Engineering of Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) have jointly given a lecture on autonomous electronic information devices for undergraduate students. According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called 'the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an 'input', 'output', and some 'information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their 'methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking introduced by René Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement, open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future directions.

AB  - Fluidized bed thermochemical conversion of biomass (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis) displays a long record of successes, spanning from lab- to industrial scales, and stems out as the most viable pathway for the exploitation of biogenic fuels, either alone or in combination with fossil fuels. In spite of its diffusion, there are still open design and operational issues that are largely related to segregation and mixing of solid and gas phases in fluidized beds and effectiveness of multiphase contacting patterns. The common claim of fluidized beds being well stirred/well controlled environments for heterogeneous and gas-phase reactions falls short when applied to processing of biomass fuels. This study aims at providing a comprehensive framework of fundamental phenomena affecting mixing/segregation of phases during thermochemical processing of biomass and of their interlinks. The basic processes include patterns and kinetics of biomass devolatilization, particle and volatile matter (VM) segregation along and across the reaction chamber, particle attrition/fragmentation and generation of fine particulates, the diversity of gasification patterns and rates, as related to chemical composition and morphology of the parent biogenic fuels. Segregation brings about important consequences in terms of temperature uniformity, of proper control of heterogeneous and gas-phase reaction pathways, of ash behaviour, of pollutant emissions, of plant operability and dependability. Measures to counteract segregation, including pre-processing of biomass and/or appropriate control of bed hydrodynamics, will also be surveyed from the fundamental and applied standpoints. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a light-weight rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on off-the-shelf open source hardware to achieve high performance computing, cost effectiveness, portability, and easy accessiblity. The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are increasingly gaining interest as a source of renewable energy. These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We are developing room temperature electronics based upon the ROACH platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in the FPGA by storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Biochips, or digital labs-on-chip, are developed with the purpose of being used by laboratory technicians or biologists in laboratories or clinics. In this article, we expand this vision with the goal of enabling everyone, regardless of their expertise, to use biochips for their own personal purposes. We developed OPENDROP, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OPENDROP consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OPENDROP, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47% of attempts to replicate OPENDROP were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications. Our work provides a step towards a future in which everyone will be able to create microfluidic devices for their personal applications, thereby democratizing parts of health care. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)–a common model species in ecotoxicology—to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water. © 2017 Steffens et al.

AB  - Experts play an important role in foresight. However, their expertise can also limit their view on potential new developments and thereby reduce the predictive as well as the explorative quality of foresight. This is why involving citizens or laypeople is potentially a welcome addition when studying the future. In this paper, we present the results of a study in the Netherlands about how Dutch citizens think about the future in general, and about the future course of specific technologies in particular. The survey shows that Dutch citizens tend to display a form of social pessimism for the long-term future, although they are optimistic about their own futures. In terms of technology outlooks, people are optimistic about the development and impact of technology on society as well as on their personal lives in general terms, although they are anxious about specific developments in the fields of robotics, digitization, biotechnology and energy technology. The paper argues that taking the opinions of a broad group of citizens in the development of technology and policies related to technology is key to a better future for all.

AB  - Eclosion in flies and other insects is a circadian-gated behaviour under control of a central and a peripheral clock. It is not influenced by the motivational state of an animal, and thus presents an ideal paradigm to study the relation and signalling pathways between central and peripheral clocks, and downstream peptidergic regulatory systems. Little is known, however, about eclosion rhythmicity under natural conditions, and research into this direction is hampered by the physically closed design of current eclosion monitoring systems. We describe a novel open eclosion monitoring system (WEclMon) that allows the puparia to come into direct contact with light, temperature and humidity. We demonstrate that the system can be used both in the laboratory and outdoors, and shows a performance similar to commercial closed funnel-type monitors. Data analysis is semi-automated based on a macro toolset for the open imaging software Fiji. Due to its open design, the WEclMon is also well suited for optogenetic experiments. A small screen to identify putative neuroendocrine signals mediating time from the central clock to initiate eclosion showed that optogenetic activation of ETH-, EH and myosuppressin neurons can induce precocious eclosion. Genetic ablation of myosuppressin-expressing neurons did, however, not affect eclosion rhythmicity. © 2017 Ruf et al.

AB  - Objective. Fluorescence imaging through head-mounted microscopes in freely behaving animals is becoming a standard method to study neural circuit function. Flexible, open-source designs are needed to spur evolution of the method. Approach. We describe a miniature microscope for single-photon fluorescence imaging in freely behaving animals. The device is made from 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components. These microscopes weigh less than 1.8 g, can be configured to image a variety of fluorophores, and can be used wirelessly or in conjunction with active commutators. Microscope control software, based in Swift for macOS, provides low-latency image processing capabilities for closed-loop, or BMI, experiments. Main results. Miniature microscopes were deployed in the songbird premotor region HVC (used as a proper name), in singing zebra finches. Individual neurons yield temporally precise patterns of calcium activity that are consistent over repeated renditions of song. Several cells were tracked over timescales of weeks and months, providing an opportunity to study learning related changes in HVC. Significance. 3D printed miniature microscopes, composed completely of consumer grade components, are a cost-effective, modular option for head-mounting imaging. These easily constructed and customizable tools provide access to cell-type specific neural ensembles over timescales of weeks. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Fab Labs, fabrication laboratories, are shared workshops where citizens can access digital fabrication equipment to design and make their own objects. They are proliferating rapidly and represent an alternative to mass production and consumption, an ideology whose environmental and social benefits their “makers” like to espouse. A longitudinal ethnographic study in a Fab Lab in a European design school examined the Lab’s ideology building, how ideals were enacted and where compromises were visible. Environmental issues were intertwined with other ideological concerns, but they were rarely promoted in their own right. Engagement with sustainability-oriented makers and stakeholders is recommended. © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that has been accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware. © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - Objective To determine the effectiveness of a parent health report on fruit and vegetable consumption among preschoolers and kindergarteners. Design Pre-post open design trial and a randomized controlled trial. Setting A university-sponsored preschool and kindergarten. Participants A total of 63 parents of preschool and kindergarten students participated in the pre-post open design trial and 65 parents participated in the randomized controlled trial. Intervention Parents in intervention groups were given a parent health report providing information about their child's fruit and vegetable intake as well as recommendations for how to increase their child's fruit and vegetable consumption. Main Outcome Measure Change in fruit and vegetable consumption. Analysis Latent growth curve modeling with Bayesian estimation. Results Vegetable consumption increased by 0.3 servings/d in the open trial and 0.65 servings/d in the randomized trial. Fruit consumption did not increase significantly in either study. Conclusions and Implications Results from both an open trial and a randomized controlled trial suggested that the parent health report may be a beneficial tool to increase vegetable consumption in preschoolers and kindergarteners. Increases in vegetable consumption can lead to the establishment of lifelong habits of healthy vegetable intake and decrease risk for chronic diseases. © 2017 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior

AB  - Isaac Newton famously observed that "if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." We propose that this sentiment is a powerful motivation for the "open-source" movement in scientific research, in which creators provide everything needed to replicate a given project online, as well as providing explicit permission for users to use, improve, and share it with others. Here, we write to introduce analytical chemists who are new to the open-source movement to best practices and concepts in this area and to survey the state of open-source research in analytical chemistry. We conclude by considering two examples of open-source projects from our own research group, with the hope that a description of the process, motivations, and results will provide a convincing argument about the benefits that this movement brings to both creators and users. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - One oft-cited strategy towards sustainability is improving energy efficiency inside public buildings. In this context, the educational buildings sector presents a very interesting and important case for the monitoring and management of buildings, since it addresses both energy and educational issues. In this work, we present and discuss the hardware IoT infrastructure substrate that provides real-time monitoring in multiple school buildings. We believe that such a system needs to follow an open design approach: rely on hardware-agnostic components that communicate over well-defined open interfaces. We present in detail the design of our hardware components, while also providing insights to the overall system design and a first set of results on their operation. The presented hardware components are utilized as the core hardware devices for GAIA, an EU research project aimed at the educational community. As our system has been deployed and tested in several public school buildings in Greece, we also report on its validation. © 2017

AB  - An open-source 3-D printable laboratory sample rotator mixer is developed here in two variants that allow users to opt for the level of functionality, cost saving and associated complexity needed in their laboratories. First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Automatic feeders are widely used in animal experiments to dispense an accurate amount of food reward for each trial. Several commercial automatic feeders for animal experiments are available which are specific to certain species and food types. However, it would be beneficial for researchers if they could easily build their own experimental feeders customized for their study species, food types, and other experimental considerations. In this paper, we describe an open source experimental feeder using an Arduino microcontroller. The design of the feeder is focused on simplicity to provide a straight-forward building process and allow custom modifications for various requirements. The cost for building this feeder is less than €200 and we have successfully tested our design with three different food types for pigeons, cats, and marmoset monkeys. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is considered to be a major driving innovation in tissue engineering, since a custom-made manufacturing for patients is essential for tissue and organ generation. Depending on the bio-materials and the applications, various 3D bio-printing technologies are used. A system capable of printing a variety of bio-materials through various methods is required for fabrication of hybrid scaffolds for tissue engineering research. This paper describes the design and integration of a multi-channel 3D bio-printing system at an affordable price based on open source hardware and software. The hardware and software components of the 3D bio-printing system and the process of finding optimal printing conditions are described in the paper. Fabrication of the hybrid scaffold of synthetic polymer and cell loaded hydrogel are presented to validate the performance of the system. © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We present the design, modelling and characterization in the 2.4 GHz band of a B-shaped antenna consisting of a dual circular loop over a conductor plane. The proposed design is intrinsically unbalanced and features a very good match to a 50 Ω line at resonance, which makes our device essentially plug'n'play for a coaxial cable feed. Another interesting property of the proposed antenna is its simplicity of construction. The antenna has been modelled using the moment method. A prototype resonant at 2.4 GHz has been built and we have measured its impedance in this spectral region. The radiation pattern and the gain at resonance have also been characterized and the device has been shown to provide 6.31 dBi gain. The overall properties of the device make it an excellent option to provide WiFi connectivity when required in open hardware implementations. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents a new wireless platform designed for an integrated traffic/flash flood monitoring system. The sensor platform is built around a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller and a 2.4 GHz 802.15.4 ISM compliant radio module. It can be interfaced with fixed traffic sensors, or receive data from vehicle transponders. This platform is specifically designed for solar-powered, low bandwidth, high computational performance wireless sensor network applications. A self-recovering unit is designed to increase reliability and allow periodic hard resets, an essential requirement for sensor networks. A radio monitoring circuitry is proposed to monitor incoming and outgoing transmissions, simplifying software debugging. We illustrate the performance of this wireless sensor platform on complex problems arising in smart cities, such as traffic flow monitoring, machine-learning-based flash flood monitoring or Kalman-filter based vehicle trajectory estimation. All design files have been uploaded and shared in an open science framework, and can be accessed from https://osf.io/fuyqd/. The hardware design is under CERN Open Hardware License v1.2. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet our understanding and attachment to themis rather limited. One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Much is made of the diversity for MOOCs learners—with their varied motivations and interests; yet MOOCs are often run and judged on the assumption that learners would progress through the course in its entirety, to completion. This paper presents an analysis of three recently delivered MOOCs that were designed to support a broader set of learner goals. A modular design was used, where each part included well defined learning outcomes and assessment criteria, and where completion was rewarded with digital badges. The paper proposes a new categorisation of learner achievement and methods of visualising learner behaviour that compliment this more open design. Results show that this approach recognises micro-learning that is missed if only completion rates are considered. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mobile robots are valuable tools for education because of both the enthusiasm they raise and the multidisciplinary nature of robotics technology. Mobile robots give access to a wide range of fields, such as complex mechanics, sensors, wireless transmission, mathematics, and computer science. However, despite their potential as educational tools, robots are still not as widespread in schools as they could be. In this article, we identify five key reasons: lack of diversity, high cost, noninclusive design, lack of educational material, and lack of stability over time. Then, we describe our answers to these problems, as we implemented them in the Thymio project: a mature mass-produced open-hardware robot, at a low price, with a multiage and gender-neutral feature set, and with a design promoting creativity, facilitating learning, and providing a wide range of interaction possibilities from built-in behaviors to text programming, passing through different visual programming environments. We highlight some neglected key issues that differentiate open-source hardware from open-source software, for instance the legal uncertainty of designing open hardware using professional computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the difficulty to distribute the development. Our solution to these being to increase the awareness of CAD editors to open-source hardware and to provide a two-layer development model for hardware. © 1994-2011 IEEE.

AB  - This article discusses an open-hardware robotics kit approach for designing spatial haptic interfaces. Our development of an open-source haptic device kit called WoodenHaptics, for which blueprints have been made available online for free download, enables interaction designers with little electromechanical experience to modify, manufacture, and assemble fully working haptic devices. This article addresses the processes of open-sourcing spatial haptic devices by covering the key mechanical and electrical principles needed for high-fidelity haptic rendering, the mathematical foundations for spatial haptics, the challenges to open-sourcing software and hardware and teaching it to different communities, and the history of the WoodenHaptics project itself. © 1994-2011 IEEE.

AB  - One of the chief obstacles in achieving wider acceptance of robotics is that only experienced roboticists can develop robotics applications. If we want robots in our homes and offices, we need more tools and platforms that reduce the costs in time and money of prototyping robots. The open-source paradigm offers a potential solution to these key factors. However, creating open-source robotics hardware does not mean just making the design files available online. It is essential to design the hardware in such a way that it can be built and modified by nonexpert users. © 1994-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Theories of knowledge reuse posit two distinct processes: reuse for replication and reuse for innovation. We identify another distinct process, reuse for customization. Reuse for customization is a process in which designers manipulate the parameters of metamodels to produce models that fulfill their personal needs. We test hypotheses about reuse for customization in Thingiverse, a community of designers that shares files for three-dimensional printing. 3D metamodels are reused more often than the 3D models they generate. The reuse of metamodels is amplified when the metamodels are created by designers with greater community experience. Metamodels make the community's design knowledge available for reuse for customization- or further extension of the metamodels, a kind of reuse for innovation.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a modulation strategy for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) by using a simple and consumable-free modulator. This “Do-It-Yourself” interface comprised a 1.0 m×0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GC×GC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GC×GC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GC×GC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A method for directly measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using a mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed and tested. First, a compact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on vehicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1×12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100×100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio measurements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of -12 to 226CO2 ha-1 h-1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 25.9 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 28.76 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R2 = 0:53 in summer and R2 = 0:47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within ±1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerodynamic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance. © Author(s) 2017.

AB  - In order to reduce working resistance of seeding opener and soil disturbance, the opener based on bionic sailfish head curve was designed. The two-dimensional (2D) drafting software of CATIA (computer aided three-dimensional interactive application) is used for getting the sailfish head profile curve. The head profile curve segments of sailfish is obtained based on the relative positional coordinates of points. Using the agronomic requirements and the parameters of the head profile curve segments of sailfish determine the structural parameters of opener. The main structure parameters of the opener are penetration angle of 30° and penetration clearance angle of 6°. Due to the interaction of the soil and the opener during movement is a complex process, the discrete element simulation from microscopic point of view is performed to study the interaction between the opener and the soil. The discrete element model of soil is established. In order to ensure the accuracy of test data, the related parameters are calibrated. Soil resistance is influenced by working depth and soil moisture content. At the same time, the relationship between working depth and soil disturbance is obtained. The software of EDEM (enhanced discrete element method) is used for the simulation analysis of working resistance and soil disturbance of the opener. Soil moisture content is 12%±1%, 16%±1%, and 20%±1%, working depth is 30, 60, and 90 mm, respectively, and forward speed of the opener is 0.5 m/s. Under these working conditions, the working resistance of the opener and its disturbance to soil are studied. Simulation results show that the working resistance of the opener increases with the increasing of soil moisture content, and also increases with the increasing of ditching depth, the horizontal resistance is between 19.70 and 74.60 N, the vertical resistance is between 9.37 and 26.90 N, the width of the disturbance in the opener is between 140 and 200 mm, and the soil returning depth is between 19 and 80 mm. In order to prove the credibility of the simulation results of the EDEM and the rationality of the opener, the experiments are carried out in the agricultural soil test laboratory of the northeast agricultural university. Simulation of work resistance and test results showed that the trend of change in work resistance was roughly the same, the relative error were between 5.04% and 27.08%. Compared with the experimental results, the simulation results were almost the same as the experimental results, and the difference of the ditching depth was between -2.5 and 0.67 mm, but the simulation results of the disturbance width were between 106.7 and 140 mm, smaller than the experimental results, which may be related to the larger particle size of the simulated particles. The trend was basically the same. The opener based on bionic sailfish head curve and the arc-type opener were selected for contrast experiment. The results showed that the performance of the opener based on bionic sailfish head curve was better than the arc-type opener. The research shows the feasibility of using the discrete element method to simulate opener's working resistance and soil disturbance, and provides a convenient method for the opener design. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - A portable probe based on open hardware architecture for the assessment of soil thermal properties and water content using the DPHP method is presented. The mean percentage errors for assessment of volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity were 4.6% and 8.9% respectively, computed after sensor spacing calibration in agar stabilized water. The DPHP probe has been tested for soil thermal properties assessment and compared to TDR probe for the water content estimation in four different soils. The DPHP probe showed an accuracy comparable to TDR in estimating water content, with DPHP showing lower values of error index in 3 samples out of 4. The DPHP can be used to investigate smaller volume of soil than TDR probe can do however, TDR is much faster than DPHP in measure acquisition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system, nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The system allows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recorded with a 24-bit EEG system with minimum bandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided - Wearing the Web - in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - KdUINO buoy, a moored citizen science system with low-cost sensors is based on the open hardware platform Arduino and quasi digital optical light sensors that measure a parameter related to water transparency, the diffuse attenuation coefficient. The buoy also has a real-time clock and an SD memory card to save data and the time of the measurements. Volunteers tested KdUINOs in Canada and Antarctica. They did some preliminary tests with KdUINOs where they compared light diffuse attenuation coefficient between Ramsey Lake and Lake Laurentian. Ramsey Lake has depths up to 100 m, a diverse population of fish and normal pH for the boreal region of Canada. KdUINO was deployed through fall freeze and left in place until spring melt through winter 2015, with atmospheric temperatures down to -20° C during the winter, and it worked properly under these freezing weather conditions. The preliminary tests concluded that Ramsey Lake was found to have a Kd about six times lower than Lake Laurentian, indicating, as expected, that Ramsey Lake is much more transparent than Lake Laurentian. In Antarctica, taking advantage of the annual research campaigns of the Hesperides vessel, a volunteer, who was a technician of the ship, made measurements using the KdUINO at 60° S and 61° S. The temperature of the water/air of the sampling points was 1.5° C and -2° C. light diffuse attenuation coefficient values obtained are within the expected values in this region.

AB  - Type D flip-flop cell and its scannable version called Muxed-D are the most used sequential components in cell-based synchronous designs because it simplifies timing analysis and it is less susceptible to race problems. However, as technology nodes shrink, it becomes more difficult, especially for high-performance designs, to cope with a hard global timing boundary. The use of latches emerges as a possible solution to the contemporary design challenges such as clock skew/jitter, PVT variation, and low-power and high-performance designs. Moreover, latches are also gaining popularity among asynchronous and timing resilient circuits. One of the available scannable cells for latches is called level sensitivity scan-based design (LSSD). The goal of this brief is to present an open design of an optimized single-latch LSSD cell, which has better tradeoffs between propagation delay, power, energy, and silicon area than the original LSSD design, thus reducing the cost for testing latch-based designs. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Due to the complex process of designing and manufacturing new plant tissue culture vessels through conventional means there have been limited efforts to innovate improved designs. Further, development and availability of low cost, energy efficient LEDs of various spectra has made it a promising light source for plant growth in controlled environments. However, direct replacement of conventional lighting sources with LEDs does not address problems with uniformity, spectral control, or the challenges in conducting statistically valid experiments to assess the effects of light. Prototyping using 3D printing and LED based light sources could help overcome these limitations and lead to improved culture systems. Results: A modular culture vessel design in which the fluence rate and spectrum of light are independently controlled was designed, prototyped using 3D printing, and evaluated for plant growth. This design is compatible with semi-solid and liquid based culture systems. Observations on morphology, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence based stress parameters from in vitro plants cultured under different light spectra with similar overall fluence rate indicated different responses in Nicotiana tabacum and Artemisia annua plantlets. This experiment validates the utility of 3D printing to design and test functional vessels and demonstrated that optimal light spectra for in vitro plant growth is species-specific. Conclusions: 3D printing was successfully used to prototype novel culture vessels with independently controlled variable fluence rate/spectra LED lighting. This system addresses several limitations associated with current lighting systems, providing more uniform lighting and allowing proper replication/randomization for experimental plant biology while increasing energy efficiency. A complete procedure including the design and prototyping of a culture vessel using 3D printing, commercial scale injection molding of the prototype, and conducting a properly replicated experiment are discussed. This open source design has the scope for further improvement and adaptation and demonstrates the power of 3D printing to improve the design of culture systems. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)—this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS—located on the user’s computer. The proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an implementation method of the real-time tracking control system for a two-wheeled mobile robot. The proposed tracking control system is structured so that the target velocities are generated using the reference generated by the realtime path generator and current posture information of the robot. Two PI controllers are used to track he target velocities. The proposed realtime path generator generates SPP (single polar polynomial) curves for the curved path and can handle the speed and acceleration constraints of the actuators of the mobile robot. The proposed path generator does not need to store the entire path information over time. It computes and saves the minimum information required to generate the path offline and generates all path references in real-time. The proposed method is implemented in Arduino Due, which is an open source hardware, and applied to a lab-built mobile to demonstrate that the proposed tracking control system can be implemented on a small scale system such as a microcontroller. © ICROS 2017.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an implementation method for a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator for an inverted pendulum system using low cost open-source hardware. We adopted the Arch Max (ARM Cortex-M4-based open-source hardware) as an HIL simulator platform. Using the nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) mechanism of the Cortex-M4 core, we assigned three interrupts with different priorities to handle three parts of the HIL simulator. The model equation of the inverted pendulum system was solved in real-time using the Runge-Kutta method in a timer interrupt service routine. An input capture interrupt-based method was used to simulate the motor drive by converting the duty ratio of pulse width modulation (PWM) signals into the voltage level applied to a DC motor. To simulate incremental rotary encoders, which are two sensors for the inverted pendulum system, a timer interrupt-based quadrature pulse generation algorithm was presented and to generate the quadrature pulse more accurately, an error compensation method was also provided. Finally, animation functionality to give a visual indication of how the controller is progressing was implemented through Vpython. Through experiments, we illustrated that the proposed HIL simulator successfully simulates the real inverted pendulum and is useful for teaching students about designing a working controller through programming embedded devices. © ICROS 2017.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a remote control and monitoring system using the Raspberry Pi as an IoT device. The proposed system has the following features. First, various sensor information can be acquired through Arduino Due's rich peripherals. Second, the acquired information is delivered to a PC through Ethernet communication of Raspberry Pi, which is an IoT device. Third, easy use is supported through a lab-built user interface. In the proposed system, the acquisition of sensor information and processing of control commands are performed on Arduino Due, and the measured information is designed to be transmitted to Raspberry Pi through SPI communication. A lab-built GUI program is introduced to efficiently display the received the sensor information on a PC efficiently. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed system, an HILS (hardware-inthe- loop simulator), which simulates the greenhouse phenomenon, is implemented using Arduino Nano. The entire proposed system is implemented using open-source hardware and can be easily deployed at low cost.

AB  - In recent years, many internet of things (IoT) platforms based on cloud computing have been proposed for general purpose applications. Though many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source hardware devices.

AB  - Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a promising technology for the implementing of high-performance and power-efficient cloud computing by serving dedicated hardware as co-processor to accelerate loads on CPUs. However, developing an FPGA-based system is challenging because the complexity of the hardware and software co-design. In this paper, we propose a platform named hCODE to simplify the design, share, and deployment of FPGA accelerators. First, we adopt a shell-and-IP design pattern to improve the reusability and the portability of accelerator designs. Second, we implement an open accelerator repository to bridge hardware development and software development on one platform. On the hCODE platform, hardware developers can provide designs that follow hCODE specifications, which allowing software engineers to easily search, download, and integrate accelerators in their applications without caring about the hardware details. © 2017 Information Processing Society of Japan

AB  - Open hardware platforms are gaining wide popularity in various fields of technology for their accessibility and inexpensiveness. Although availability of these platforms is undeniable, the performance of these machines in handling tasks which require execution within critical time constraints is still in question. Moreover, technical documentation and support for open hardware are scarce in comparison to expensive commercially distributed platforms. In this paper, we present a detailed process to implement embedded Linux and the real-time extension of Xenomai to two popular open embedded hardware, BeagleBone Black and i. MX6Q SABRELite. Also, we analyze the response time of real-time mechanisms and its performance for inter-task communication (ITC) between real-time tasks. Response time of real-time mechanisms is an important measure to predict the realtime performance of each platform. The performance evaluation is performed both in kernel space and user space using the metrics of jitter, to estimate the periodicity of the cyclic task, and execution time of three real-time mechanisms including semaphore, message queue, and message pipe. The results of this study would serve as a guideline in developing real-time systems on low cost open embedded hardware platforms using the real-time Linux extension of Xenomai.

AB  - Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 MΩ show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The bending stiffness of the wind turbine blades has decreased due to the trend of wind turbine upsizing. Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Open source design (OSD) is an emerging mode of product design. In OSD process, how to select right tasks directly influences the efficiency and quality of task completion, hence impacting the whole evolution process of OSD. In this paper, designer's bidirectional behavior of task selection integrating passive selection based on website recommendation and autonomous selection is modeled. First, the model of passive selection behavior by website recommendation is proposed with application of collaborative filtering algorithm, based on a three-dimensional matrix including information of design agents, tasks, and skills; second, the model of autonomous selection behavior is described in consideration of factors such as skill and incentive; third, the model of bidirectional selection behavior is described integrating the aforementioned two selection algorithms. At last, contrast simulation analysis of bidirectional selection, passive selection based on website recommendation, and autonomous selection is proposed with ANOVA, and results show that task selection behavior has significant effect on OSD evolution process and that bidirectional selection behavior is more effective to shorten evolution cycle according to the experiment settings. In addition, the simulation study testifies the model of bidirectional selection by describing the task selection process of OSD in microperspective. © 2017 Shuo Zhang and Yingzi Li.

AB  - Due to proliferation in the metropolitan areas there existing problem of poor traffic congestion has grown at alarming event and it is not easy to find the stolen vehicles. So here we use Theft vehicle detection system for finding the theft vehicles using open source hardware of RASPBERRY PI.This system make use of RFID and embedded technology. Here each vehicle is placed with RFID tag. Whenever the RFID reader reads the RFID tag in the stolen vehicle it alert the traffic police and the signal will be automatically changed into red light until the vehicle is recovered from the stolen person. This is achieved by connecting cloud technology with server which is handle by the traffic police. When the traffic controller ensures that the particular vehicle is missed then, whenever that particular vehicle crossed by the any signal red light blinks automatically then cloud displays the message with vehicle number.By using this system, we can alert the signal and can easily find the stolen vehicle by tracking the RFID tag. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB  - Sustainable development necessitates the management of progress in science and technology for society's betterment while preserving Earth's resources. In this regard, the appearance in recent years of low-cost sophisticated products consuming resources economically is a force for good. This effort terms each of these products as an advanced frugal innovation to highlight the frugality in resource consumption during the realization of these innovations through advances in various scientific disciplines. Other than 25 examples of advanced frugal innovations in a wide range of sectors from rural electrification to particle physics, a framework for the systematic realization of such innovations for sustainable development has also been described. The innovations showcased bring out the use of advances in science and technology or cutting edge knowledge for creating these low-cost sophisticated products. Moreover, the need for innovators typically with training in advanced knowledge areas to handle the sophistication in technology for the successful fruition of these innovations is also discussed. This effort supports the frugal design and frugal engineering of innovations, whether grassroots or the advanced type, through sound scientific principles for the creation of robust products, especially where the human life is at stake, in various sectors for all-round sustainable development. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The number of disposable molecular diagnostics tests in the IVD market has been growing rapidly and is bound to continue to grow in the near future. The internal complexity of these rapid tests increases with the complexity of the diagnostic assay implemented by them. Some assays require precise temperature control (±1°C–5°C) for an extended time (i.e. 15–60 minutes) for the reactions involved to run properly. Microheating components in them must meet strict criteria with respect to power consumption, physical size and cost. The proposed finite element model is intended to provide tools for in silico validation of device designs (geometries, structural materials), as well as to help in the interpretation of heat transfer processes inside the thermal system present in a molecular diagnostics device. The proposed model was developed for and validated with polyimide etched foil heating elements actively controlled via a mini-thermostat. The thermostat was designed for battery-based operation and implemented with open-source hardware (Arduino-compatible). Plastic test structures were created that emulated disposable Lab-on-a-Chip devices with microfluidic channels to hold liquid volumes on the scale of 0.1 mL. The experimental setup was demonstrated to maintain target temperatures over at least 30 minutes with at least ±1°C around the set point operated from batteries. Physical parameters of the resistive heating element used were fed into the finite element model and simulation results compared to the performance of the aforementioned experimental setup. © 2017 WIT Press.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on an action research project with two emergent micro-businesses that explored how their business model connected with the principles of open source. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first gained initial qualitative data to establish the core values of each micro-business, which the authors then explored in the context of open source and business models in two design workshops with each organisation. Findings: The authors developed the open source guild business model, which has the elements of: building a focal micro-business with resources secured through the guild, promoting learning and development through apprenticeship, promoting shared values through a commons of experience and capturing value by protecting key intellectual property. Research limitations/implications: This research was undertaken with two emergent micro-businesses in the North West of England. Further research will be needed to establish the wider applicability of the open source guild model. Practical implications: The open source guild model can be a mechanism for an emergent micro-business to create a community around their values and grow their business without conventional external investment of resources. Originality/value: This research contributes to the literature on business models based on open source and how these models can be sustainable in terms of the quadruple bottom line, which extends the triple bottom line to include personal values and meaning. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Arduino open-source microcontrollers are well known in sensor applications for scientific equipment and for controlling RepRap 3D printers. Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community.

AB  - Purpose - Increasing use of 3D printing techniques to manufacture consumer products and open-source designs raises the question of "What is the mechanical reliability of 3D printed parts?" Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impacts of build orientation on the mechanical reliability of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) produced using 3D printing. Design/methodology/approach - Tensile tests on ABS specimens were performed with and without a hole in the center, which were produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM). Seven sets of approximately 30 specimens were printed in XY, XZ and C-45 orientations to obtain reliable fracture statistics. Weibull analysis was performed to quantify the variation in the tensile strength. Findings - The Weibull analysis showed that the reliability of FDM produced ABS can be as low as advanced ceramics. Weibull moduli of specimens without a hole were between 26 and 69, and specimens with a hole had Weibull moduli between 30 and 41. P-type deviations from the Weibull statistics were observed. The XZ orientation resulted in the highest average fracture strength for specimens with and without a hole, and C+45 orientation resulted in the lowest strength. Practical implications - As the Weibull distribution relates the applied stress to probability of failure, the Weibull analysis provides a practical design criterion to achieve specific reliability levels for additively manufactured parts. Originality/value - This study, for the first time, provides Weibull statistics for FDM-produced ABS parts, which can be used to predict mechanical reliability. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Over sixty years after their construction, many Ina-Casa neighbourhoods demonstrate the need for extensive “mending”. Specific intervention methodologies are required to redevelop them considering the many players and needs involved, the testimonial value of the patrimony, and the fragmented ownership structure. An analysis of the inadequacies and an assessment of the priorities that inhabitants attribute to them were fundamental in defining a participatory redevelopment strategy, which has been tested on “La Fiorita” in Cesena. The research developed a catalogue of solutions that can be incorporated into packages and is conceived as an intervention manual. It has been devised to foster a combination of individual and collective actions and is associated with an incentive system. © 2017 Firenze University Press

AB  - Purpose: Smart eyewear, such as augmented or virtual reality headset, allows the projection of virtual content through a display worn on the user’s head. This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named “CARTON”, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch. Design/methodology/approach: User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON’s hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities. Findings: Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task. Originality/value: The authors describe a novel way to create a smart eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to accelerate research around it. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurately measuring the partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) in non-intubated patients is problematic due to dilution of expired CO2 at high O2 flows and mask designs that may either cause CO2 rebreathing or inadequately capture expired CO2. We evaluated the performance of 2 capnographic O2 masks (Cap-ONE and OxyMask) against a clinically expedient method using a standard O2 mask with a flow-directed nasal cannula used for capnography (CapnoLine) in a spontaneous breathing model of an adult and child under conditions of normal ventilation, hypoventilation, and hyperventilation. METHODS: An ASL-5000 simulator was attached to a manikin face with a catheter port, through which various CO2/air mixtures were bled into the ASL-5000 to achieve a PETCO2 of 40, 65, and 30 mm Hg. Both PETCO2 and inspired PCO2 were measured at O2 flows of 5, 10, 15, and 20 L/min (adult model) and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min (pediatric model). RESULTS: PETCO2 decreased to varying degrees as O2 flow increased, depending upon the breathing pattern. Although all devices appeared to perform reasonably well under normal and hyperventilation conditions, the clinically expedient method was associated with substantially more CO2 rebreathing. PETCO2 usually deteriorated more under simulated hypoventilation, regardless of the measurement method. CONCLUSIONS: Both of the specially designed O2 capnography masks provided reasonably stable PETCO2 without significant CO2 rebreathing at the commonly used O2 flows. Because of their open design, Pmeasured at high Oflows may produce artificiallyETCO2 2 lower readings that may not reflect arterial CO2 levels compared with lower O2 flows. © 2017 Daedalus Enterprises.

AB  - Screw centrifugal pump with single blade have some features such as large wrap angle and high degree of distortion.Considering the mold making and casting reasons, semi-open design is widely adopted, which causes a gap between the edge of the impeller and the bottom cover. This gap directly affects the operating efficiency of the unit, the inside flow field, pressure fluctuation and vibration characteristics are influenced as well. In this paper, we focused on the relationship between tip clearance and external characteristics, and on the influences of the internal fluctuation. Hydraulic design and structural design were conducted aiming at semi-open screw centrifugal pump of which specific speed was 237, by means of adjusting the tip clearance and judging the current and voice, the minimum tip clearance while unit operating normally was 0.3mm, External characteristic test was conducted on the open type test bench of two stage precisions which met national standards, parameters of the best operating point were as follows, head: 9.05 m, flow rate: 196.9 m3/h, power: 6.84 kW, efficiency: 70.92%. Then the tip clearance was changed to 0.5 mm and 0.8 mm, the ratio with impeller diameter was 0.13%, 0.22% and 0.35%, respectively. External characteristic test was done separately, the influence of tip clearance to external characteristic was analyzed. Meanwhile, aiming at the design point of three kinds of tip clearance, pressure fluctuation was monitored at the edge and middle area of impeller and third section and tongue area of volute with sampling frequency was 8 192 and sampling time of each working condition was 30 - 50 s, phase reference technique was used to accomplish the separate of whole cycle's data sample. A series of pressure waveform, pressure coefficient waveform and frequency domain diagram were plotted and analyzed at the last. Results showed that when the clearance was changed from 0.3 m to 0.5 mm, head and efficiency decreased by 0.74 m and 3.6% respectively. When the clearance was changed from 0.5 m to 0.8 mm, head and efficiency decreased by 1.16 m and 5.3%, respectively. In view of pump in this paper, the allowed clearance range was 0.3 - 0.5 mm, the ratio with impeller diameter was 0.13% - 0.22%, which provided reference for the following research. Besides, at the impeller inlet area, there existed a large area of negative pressure, pressure leakage was serious when enlarging the tip clearance, thus increasing the average pressure within the cycle, which caused the pressure coefficient waveform of 0.8 mm was most gentle and 0.3 mm was most fluctuant. At the same number times of rotating frequency, the center of the impeller was larger than the inlet edge of the blade, and it was easier to capture the high frequency conversion characteristics, the main reason was that the middle radius was large and working ability was strong. In the case of 0.8 mm clearance, when pressure fluctuation was in the process of gradually increasing from the minimum value, there occurred a phenomenon of sudden drop slightly and then rose up again. The pressure wave trend at the third section and tongue of the volute was the opposite, at these two points, the amplitude of main frequency was largest when clearance was 0.3 mm, almost the same when clearance was 0.5 m and 0.8 mm. The amplitude of the main frequency at these four points was from large to small: middle area of the impeller, inlet area of the impeller, third section of the volute, tongue of the volute. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - This paper reviews a new real-time measurement instrument dedicated for online neutron monitoring with fission chambers in nuclear reactors. The instrument implements the higher order Campbelling methods and self-monitoring capabilities on an open source development board. The board includes an CPU/FPGA System on a Chip. The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Software bugs are a critical threat to the deployability and maintainability of low-power wireless sensors, resulting in excess power consumption, hardware misconfigurations, incorrect data, and shortened device lifetimes. Worse, these errors can prevent wireless reprogramming, resulting in longer delays and costly human interventions. This letter describes shoulder angel - an ultra-low-power, low-cost, open hardware and software platform that ensures users can always recover and reprogram wireless sensors, in spite of software errors. Shoulder angel uses a physically separate coprocessor to monitor a device's power consumption and other behaviors, while keeping the device in a reprogrammable state. Our results show that shoulder angel is able to recover from otherwise fatal software errors while incurring an energy overhead of only 7μW. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Although theoretically the patent system is meant to bolster innovation, the current United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is cumbersome and involves a significant time investment to locate inactive patents less than 20 years old. This article reports on the development of an open source database to find these public domain ideas. First, a search strategy is explained. Then the operation and use of free and open source software are detailed to meet the needs of open hardware innovators. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach with 3-D printing. The results showed how the Free Inactive Patent Search enables users to search using plain language text to find public domain concepts and then provides a hyperlinked list of ideas that takes users to the USPTO database for the patent for more information. All of the source code to operate the search and the website are open source themselves and provided in the public domain for free. In the case study on 3-D printing the time to identify public domain patents was cut by a factor of more than 1500. This tool has the potential for accelerating the development of open hardware technologies to create high value for the public. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - An in-house solution for the verification of dose delivered to a moving phantom as required for the clinical implementation of lung stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy was developed. The superior–inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno™, a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS™ anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique. © 2016, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.

AB  - Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

AB  - A reliable and cheap equipment is hereby proposed for the deposition of thin films on several substrates. This system is capable of deposition using three different techniques sequentially on the same substrate. The techniques available are ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), electrodeposition, and dip coating on both rigid and flexible conductive substrates (FTO, ITO-PEN). Using low-cost electronic components, we built a working prototype, driven by a simple software that is open source and user-friendly. In order to test our system, we used it to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and counter electrodes of platinum and cobalt sulfide using both rigid glass-FTO and flexible ITO-PEN substrates. The electrodes as well as the complete devices have been characterized through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The solar cell devices have been characterized through current versus voltage curves (I-V) under simulated solar illumination. © Springer-Verlag London 2016.

AB  - Issue addressed Social networking sites (SNS) are increasingly popular platforms for health promotion. Advancements in SNS health promotion require quality evidence; however, interventions are often not formally evaluated. This study aims to describe evaluation practices used in SNS health promotion. Methods A systematic review was undertaken of Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Communication and Mass Media Complete, and Cochrane Library databases. Articles published between 2006 and 2013 describing any health promotion intervention delivered using SNS were included. Results Forty-seven studies were included. There were two main evaluation approaches: closed designs (n≤23), which used traditional research designs and formal recruitment procedures; and open designs (n≤19), which evaluated the intervention in a real-world setting, allowing unknown SNS users to interact with the content without enrolling in research. Closed designs were unable to assess reach and engagement beyond their research sample. Open designs often relied on weaker study designs with no use of objective outcome measures and yielded low response rates. Conclusions Barriers to evaluation included low participation rates, high attrition, unknown representativeness and lack of comparison groups. Acceptability was typically assessed among those engaged with the intervention, with limited population data available to accurately assess intervention reach. Few studies were able to assess uptake of the intervention in a real-life setting while simultaneously assessing effectiveness of interventions with research rigour. So what? Through use of quasi-experimental or well designed before-after evaluations, in combination with detailed engagement metrics, it is possible to balance assessment of effectiveness and reach to evaluate SNS health promotion. © Australian Health Promotion Association 2016.

AB  - We introduce a multi-functional microscope for research laboratories that have significant cost and space limitations. The microscope pivots around the sample, operating in upright, inverted, side-on and oblique geometries. At these geometries it is able to perform brightfield, fluorescence and qualitative ellipsometric imaging. It is the first single instrument in the literature to be able to perform all of these functionalities. The system can be assembled by two undergraduate students from a provided manual in less than a day, from off-the-shelf and 3D printed components, which together cost approximately 16 at 2016 market prices. We include a highly specified assembly manual, a summary of design methodologies, and all associated 3D-printing files in hopes that the utility of the design outlives the current component market. This open design approach prepares readers to customize the instrument to specific needs and applications. We also discuss how to select household LEDs as low-cost light sources for fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate the utility of the microscope in varied geometries and functionalities, with particular emphasis on studying hydrated, solidsupported lipid films and wet biological samples. © 2016 Nguyen et al.

AB  - Smart Meters (SM) are one of the first bricks in the case of Smart Grids. Indeed, the control of flows in real time contributes to the efficient management of energy and enables consumers to identify their energy-intensive appliances and, subsequently, to change their consumption practices. However, the large-scaled deployment of intelligent measurement systems will require huge investments, which will directly affect the final consumer. This paper presents the design, implementation and realization of an intelligent electricity meter. This counter is based on low cost, open hardware and software structures. It is intended to monitor, manage and control a photovoltaic water pumping station. The intelligence faculty is, indeed, due to the fact that this meter is communicating thanks to the use of new information and communication technologies (ICT). © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

AB  - In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - This paper presents a case study analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of using project-based learning (PBL) combined with collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with information communication technologies, open-source software, and open-source hardware tools, in a specialized microcontroller and embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the "Arduino" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this work we use the Arduino UNO R3 open source hardware platform to assemble an experimental apparatus for the measurement of the time constant of an RC circuit. With adequate programming, the Arduino is used as a signal generator, a data acquisition system and a basic signal visualisation tool. Theoretical calculations are compared with direct observations from an analogue oscilloscope. Data processing and curve fitting is performed on a spreadsheet. The results obtained for the six RC test circuits are within the expected interval of values defined by the tolerance of the components. The hardware and software prove to be adequate to the proposed measurements and therefore adaptable to a laboratorial teaching and learning context. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Membrane-based water treatment processes often require sophisticated control and monitoring that is not possible through manual operation. Automated regulation of pressure or flux through a membrane is required to minimize membrane fouling, thus maximizing efficiency and lifespan. Myriad automation tools exist, ranging from single purpose-built solutions to numerous linked sensors and hardware controls, all analyzed and controlled though commercially-available proprietary hardware and software. This paper outlines a way to design control systems for membrane-based filtration that utilize open source hardware and software, increasing the flexibility of a system to changing performance requirements while simultaneously minimizing the expense in time and resources to implement the control scheme. The method presented here can reduce the capital requirement for system control by one to two orders of magnitude while enhancing flexibility for system expansion and process sharing. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microbial water quality monitoring for the presence of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) is a mandatory activity in many countries and is key in public health protection. Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0 × 102 to 5.0 × 105 CFU ml−1 22–54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between β-glucuronidase and β-galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E. coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9 h compared with 13.5 h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E. coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Open-source technology not only has facilitated the expansion of the greater research community, but by lowering costs it has encouraged innovation and customizable design. The field of automated microscopy has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 μm at the maximum speed and 27 μm at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3–9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world. © 2016 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2016 Royal Microscopical Society

AB  - To reduce the wastage of electric power and electrical fires that are caused by the negligence of the elderly, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted relay control system in social networking environments. The proposed system comprises a power strip; three relays for the power strip control; an open hardware platform with light, temperature, and humidity sensors; and a camera module. In particular, it can support IP-based wireless connectivity and social networking through the Telegram Bot communicate with the elderly and their authorized persons such as family, a nurse, or a social worker. The user will receive the information from the proposed system, such as on/off states of the power strip, a type of devices connected to the power strip, and current measurement values from them, through a Telegram application on a smartphone. After checking the on/off states, the type of devices, and current measurement values, the user can decide which relays need to be controlled and send text messages with the indices of the specific relays and corresponding commands to the proposed system. Furthermore, to receive any alert messages for power saving and accident prevention, we can change the reference values for the sensors. Some experimental results verify that the proposed system can control on/off operation of the three relays, provide alert message services, and check the status of the power strip. © 2016 International Information Institute.

AB  - Crowdsourcing is an innovative business practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content or even funds by soliciting contributions from a large group of people (the 'Crowd'). The potential benefits of utilizing crowdsourcing in product design are well-documented, but little research exists on what are the barriers and opportunities in adopting crowdsourcing in new product development (NPD) of manufacturing SMEs. In order to answer the above questions, a Proof of Market study is carried out on crowdsourcing-based product design under an Innovate UK funded Smart project, which aims at identifying the needs, challenges and future development opportunities associated with adopting crowdsourcing strategies for NPD. The research findings from this study are reported here and can be used to guide future development of crowdsourcing-based collaborative design methods and tools and provide some practical references for industry to adopt this new and emerging collaborative design method in their business. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

AB  - There are currently no standardized objective measures to assess beer quality based on the most significant parameters related to the first impression from consumers, which are visual characteristics of foamability, beer color and bubble size. This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino® boards, Lego® building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied. © 2016

AB  - Background: Allergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT) has been validated for assessing allergic rhinitis (AR) control and identifying severe AR. The aim of the study was to assess the ARCT questionnaire as a tool for stepwise pharmacotherapy. Methods: A standard pharmacotherapy regimen from Step 1 (oral second-generation H1 antihistamine as needed) to Step 5 (oral corticosteroid) was carried out prospectively in a Chinese AR population. The AR patients were initiated with Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) appropriate step treatment and assessed with ARCT every 15 days. If ARCT score was equal or above 20 (controlled AR) and maintained for 15 days, the patient would finish the study; if ARCT score was strictly <20 (uncontrolled AR), the patient would receive higher step treatment according to a predefined open design up to Step 5. The different AR control subgroups were compared. Results: A total of 255 patients were enrolled in the study; 5 patients dropped out and 2 (0.8%) were controlled at day 0, 85 (34.0%) at day 15, 177 (70.8%) at day 30, 222 (88.8%) at day 45, 241 (96.4%) at day 60 and 242 (96.8%) at day 75. Only 8 (3.2%) patients remained uncontrolled at the endpoint of the study. Patients with ARIA moderate/severe or persistent symptoms, moderate/severe impaired quality of life, asthma history, rhinorrhea and cough symptoms always needed up to Step 4 (nasal corticosteroid plus antihistamine) and prolonged treatments to achieve disease control. Conclusions: The majority of AR can be controlled with standard stepwise treatment. ARCT offers an objective criterion for the stepwise pharmacotherapy of AR. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Objective: To systematically examine the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence regarding efficacy and tolerability of topiramate cotreatment with antipsychotics in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Methods: Random-effects meta-analysis of RCTs of topiramate cotreatment with antipsychotics vs. placebo/ongoing antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Standardized or weighted mean difference (SMD/WMD), risk ratio (RR) ±95% confidence intervals (CIs), and number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated. Results: Across 16 RCTs (n = 934, duration = 11.8 ± 5.6 weeks), topiramate outperformed the comparator regarding change/endpoint of total (SMD: −0.58, 95% CI: −0.82, −0.35, P < 0.00001), positive (SMD: −0.37, 95% CI: −0.61, −0.14, P = 0.002), negative (SMD: −0.58, 95% CI: −0.87, −0.29, P < 0.0001), and general symptoms (SMD: −0.68, 95% CI: −0.95, −0.40, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, topiramate was superior regarding body weight (WMD: –2.75 kg, 95% CI: −4.03, −1.47, P < 0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (WMD: –1.77, 95% CI: −2.38, −1.15, P < 0.00001), triglycerides (P = 0.006), and insulin levels (P < 0.00001). Superiority regarding psychopathology and body weight/BMI was consistent across Chinese/Asian and Western RCTs, double-blind and open designs, clozapine and non-clozapine cotreatment, augmentation and co-initiation RCTs, and higher and lower quality RCTs. In meta-regression analyses, topiramate's efficacy for total symptoms was moderated by shorter illness duration (P = 0.047), while weight loss was greater in prevention/co-initiation vs. intervention/augmentation RCTs (−4.11 kg, 95% CI: −6.70, −1.52 vs. −1.41 kg, 95% CI: −2.23, −0.59, P < 0.001). All-cause discontinuation was similar between topiramate and comparators (RR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.81, P = 0.16). While topiramate led to more concentration/attention difficulties (P = 0.03, NNH = 8, 95% CI=4–25), psychomotor slowing (P = 0.02, NNH = 7, 95% CI = 4–25), and paresthesia (P = 0.05, NNH = 2, 95% CI = 4–33), it led to less ≥7% weight gain (P = 0.0001, NNH = 2, 95% CI = 2–3) and constipation (P = 0.04, NNH = 9, 95% CI = 5–100) than the comparator. Conclusions: These results indicate that adjunctive topiramate to antipsychotics is an effective and safe treatment choice for symptomatic improvement and weight reduction in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - To compare the value of inversion recovery with on-resonant water suppression (IRON) to conventional T1-weighted (T1w) MRA and computed tomography angiography (CTA) for visualization of peripheral nitinol stents. We visualized 14 different peripheral nitinol stents in vitro both using Gadolinium (Gd) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles (USPIOs) for conventional T1w and IRON-MRA using clinical grade 1.5T MR scanner and iodinated contrast material for CTA using a 256-slice CT scanner. Parameter assessment included signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio (S/CNR), relative in-stent signal and artificial lumen narrowing. X-ray angiography served as gold standard for diameter assessment. Gd-enhanced IRON-MRA exhibited highest in-stent SNR and CNR values compared to conventional T1w MRA (IRON (Gd/USPIO): SNR = 30 ± 3/21 ± 2, CNR = 23 ± 2/14 ± 1; T1w: SNR = 16 ± 1/14 ± 2, CNR = 12 ± 1/10 ± 1, all p < 0.05). Furthermore, IRON-MRA achieved highest relative in-stent signal both using Gd and USPIO (IRON (Gd/USPIO): 121 ± 8 %/103 ± 6 %; T1w: 73 ± 2 %/66 ± 4 %; CTA: 84 ± 6 %, all p < 0.05). However, artificial lumen narrowing appeared similar in all imaging protocols (IRON (Gd/USPIO): 21 ± 3 %/21 ± 2 %; T1w: 16 ± 4 %/17 ± 3 %; CTA: 19 ± 2 %, all p = NS). Finally, IRON-MRA provided improvement of the in-stent lumen visualization with an ‘open-close-open’ design, which revealed a complete in-stent signal loss in T1w MRA. IRON-MRA improves in-stent visualization in vitro compared to conventional T1w MRA and CTA. In light of the in vitro results with Gd-enhanced IRON-MRA, the clinical implementation of such an approach appears promising. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters—photosystem II quantum yield (ΦII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others— and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Extensional shear testing is often needed to characterise the behaviour of complex fluids found in industry and nature. Traditional extensional rheometers are typically expensive, fragile and heavy and are only suited to making measurements in a laboratory environment. For some applications, it is necessary to make in situ rheological measurements where, for example, fluid properties change rapidly over time or where laboratory facilities are unavailable. This paper reports the development and validation of an inexpensive, lightweight and robust 'open source' extensional rheometer, Seymour II. Validation was carried out experimentally and computationally. Measurements on a Newtonian fluid (492 mPa s Brookfield silicone oil) yielded results of 510 ± 51 mPa s; these are comfortably within the range of ±10% which other authors have quoted for extensional techniques using laboratory rheometers. Comparison of the observed filament thinning dynamics to those obtained using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) gave good qualitative agreement. Use of Seymour II at the University of Cambridge Botanic Gardens revealed that the mucilage of the 'crane flower', Strelitzia reginae, was a viscoelastic fluid whose extensional response could be described by a two-mode Giesekus equation. Engineering drawings and image analysis code for Seymour II are available for download at the project website, www.seymourII.org/. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A number of physical factors can adversely affect cultural heritage. Therefore, monitoring parameters involved in the deterioration process, principally temperature and relative humidity, is useful for preventive conservation. In this study, a total of 15 microclimate stations using open source hardware were developed and stationed at the Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba, which is registered with UNESCO for its outstanding universal value, to assess the behavior of interior temperature and relative humidity in relation to exterior weather conditions, public hours and interior design. Long-term monitoring of these parameters is of interest in terms of preservation and reducing the costs of future conservation strategies. Results from monitoring are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this system. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets. These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait analysis. © 2016

AB  - Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics and imagining. This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a ‘pop-up’ flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or ‘pop-out’) angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems. © 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Real-time Ethernet (RTE) is widely recognized for its potential to provide a unified communication backbone for next-generation heterogeneous distributed systems. However, most of the existing research in RTE technologies has traditionally focused on formal models and theoretical analyzes of timing properties, usually omitting the associated implementation challenges for testing them in practice. This gap between theory and practice prevents experimental validation of the claimed properties, which in turn hinders the pace of innovation and adoption of the technology in industrial settings. This paper aims at narrowing the theory-practice gap by characterizing a comprehensive open-source RTE framework that explores emerging challenges in real-time networking, including the provision of ultra-low latency and jitter, dynamic bandwidth management, and segmentation within large networks. This work integrates research on formal abstractions for dynamic time-division multiple access arbitration and technological insights from modern hardware infrastructure, and uses a representative distributed video processing application to provide reproducible evidence of the achieved properties in multihop Ethernet settings. By leveraging readily available technology and an open-source design, the proposed framework facilitates further exploration and experimental validation of properties that are beyond the scope of current commercial technologies, encouraging evidence-based discussions to accelerate development and adoption of new standards for next-generation industrial networks. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The use of lasers to weld polymer sheets provides a means of highly-adaptive and custom additive manufacturing for a wide array of industrial, medical, and end user/consumer applications. This paper provides an open source design for a laser polymer welding system, which can be fabricated with low-cost fused filament fabrication and off-the-shelf mechanical and electrical parts. The system is controlled with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems. The application of these parameter sets provides users of the open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as heat exchangers. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - The commercial data acquisition systems used for seismic exploration are usually expensive equipment. In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the “big data” acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

AB  - Scattering experiments are fundamental for structure analysis of matter on molecular, atomic and sub-atomic length scales. In contrast, it is not standard to demonstrate optical scattering experiments on the undergraduate level beyond simple diffraction gratings. We present an inexpensive Mie scattering setup manufactured with 3D printing and open hardware. The experiment can be used to determine the particle size in dilute monodisperse colloidal suspensions with surprisingly high accuracy and is, thus, suitable to demonstrate relations between scattering measurements and microscopic properties of particles within undergraduate lab course projects. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Many countries have a rapidly ageing population, placing strain on health services and creating a growing market for assistive technology for older people. We have, through a student-led, 12-week project for 10 students from a variety of science and engineering backgrounds, developed an integrated sensor system to enable older people, or those at risk, to live independently in their own homes for longer, while providing reassurance for their family and carers. We provide details on the design procedure and performance of our sensor system and the management and execution of a short-term, studentled research project. Detailed information on the design and use of our devices, including a door sensor, power monitor, fall detector, general in-house sensor unit and easy-to-use location-aware communications device, is given, with our open designs being contrasted with closed proprietary systems. Acase study is presented for the use of our devices in a real-world context, along with a comparison with commercially available systems. We discuss how the system could lead to improvements in the quality of life of older users and increase the effectiveness of their associated care network. We reflect on how recent developments in open source technology and rapid prototyping increase the scope and potential for the development of powerful sensor systems and, finally, conclude with a student perspective on this team effort and highlight learning outcomes, arguing that open technologies will revolutionize the way in which technology will be deployed in academic research in the future. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Wireless Sensor and Actuators Networks (WSANs) constitute one of the most challenging technologies with tremendous socio-economic impact for the next decade. Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - The combination of open-source software and hardware provides technically feasible methods to create low-cost, highly customized scientific research equipment. Open-source 3-D printers have proven useful for fabricating scientific tools. Here the capabilities of an open-source 3-D printer are expanded to become a highly flexible scientific platform. An automated low-cost 3-D motion control platform is presented that has the capacity to perform scientific applications, including (1) 3-D printing of scientific hardware; (2) laboratory auto-stirring, measuring, and probing; (3) automated fluid handling; and (4) shaking and mixing. The open-source 3-D platform not only facilities routine research while radically reducing the cost, but also inspires the creation of a diverse array of custom instruments that can be shared and replicated digitally throughout the world to drive down the cost of research and education further. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the computer-guided process of fabricating physical objects by depositing successive layers of material. It has transformed manufacturing across virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes convenient and affordable “desktop” 3D printers. These are being used in the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast. The market predicts that within several years, 3D printers could be commonplace within the home; with so many practical uses for 3D printing, we anticipate that the technology will also play an increasingly important role in the laboratory. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

AB  - The maker movement has shown how off-the-shelf devices can be combined to perform operations that, until recently, required expensive specialized equipment. Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the "confinement gradients" approach. This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup. © 2016 Frot et al.

AB  - Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a classical technique of physical biochemistry providing information on size, shape, and interactions of macromolecules from the analysis of their migration in centrifugal fields while free in solution. A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by 3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource allocation. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

AB  - In an effort to help lower the costs of fluorescence microscopy and expand the use of this valuable technique in the classroom, teaching lab, and hopefully beyond, we provide two different open source designs for inexpensive epifluorescence microscopes. First, we explain how to 3D print the parts for a simple adapter that can be mounted onto a conventional compound light microscope with a removable head to convert it for epifluorescence and bright-field viewing. Second, we describe how to build a similar microscope using supplies that are available at most hardware stores or online. We demonstrate the capabilities of our designs using Tetrahymena thermophila cells that were stained with two common fluorophores (Rhodamine B or Acridine Orange) or tagged with a fluorescent protein. We further explain how these microscopes can be used to teach basic principles of photochemistry, biochemistry, and histochemistry, as well as cellular and molecular biology. In the spirit of making these designs open and accessible to all, we have named them "the OPN Scope", and we include instructions on how to 3D print or build these microscopes (along with the underlying computer design files) as Supporting Information, so that others can access, use, or modify them as needed. Ultimately, we hope that these designs can provide new opportunities for expanding scientific education and research, especially in schools or regions that may lack the funding for more sophisticated scientific equipment. © 2016 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - After many struggles from disability rights and independent-living advocates, urban accessibility has gradually become a concern for many urban planners across post-industrial countries. In this paper, based on ethnographic fieldwork studies in Barcelona working with urban accessibility professionals and activists, we argue for the importance of the ‘documentation interfaces’ created in their struggles: that is, the relational processes to collaboratively build multi-media accounts in a diversity of formats seeking to enforce different translations of bodily needs into specific urban accessibility arrangements. In discussion with the asymmetries that the ongoing expertization of accessibility might be opening up, we would like to foreground these apparently irrelevant practices as an interesting site to reflect on how urban accessibility struggles might allow us to rethink the project of technical democracy and its applications to urban issues. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the creation of Streets for All, a platform to contest and to sensitize technicians and citizens alike of the problems of ‘shared streets’ for the blind and partially sighted led by the Catalan Association for the Blind; and (2) the organization of the Tinkerthon, a DIY and open-source hardware workshop boosted by En torno a la silla to facilitate the creation of a network of tinkerers seeking to self-manage accessibility infrastructures. These cases not only bring to the fore different takes on the democratization of the relations between technical professionals and disability rights advocates, but also offer different approaches to the politics of universals in the design of urban accessibility arrangements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The precision and repeatability offered by computer-aided design and computer-numerically controlled techniques in biofabrication processes is quickly becoming an industry standard. However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive 'off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, 'luer-lock' syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in 3D cellular interactions and tissue engineering. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) offers CT-like 3D imaging capabilities while being appropriate for interventional suites. 3D images are reconstructed based on 2D projections gathered during the rotation of the C-arm around the object under investigation. It is mandatory to provide accurate geometrical projection parameters for each acquired 2D image, otherwise significant CT artifacts may be induced in the reconstructed 3D volume. Usually, a pre-calibration (offline calibration) using an X-ray phantom is preformed under the assumption that the C-arm motion is reproducible. Thereby, stochastic misalignments due to the open design of mobile C-arm CBCT systems are not considered. In this article we introduce a novel online calibration algorithm to compensate stochastic mechanical inaccuracies. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on simulated and real data. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational activities is an open research issue. It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (JJ Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Smart meters are an enabling technology for many smart grid applications. This paper introduces a design for a low-cost smart meter system as well as explaining fundamentals of smart metering. The smart meter platform, provided as open hardware, is designed with a connector interface compatible to the Arduino platform, thus opening the possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation features, starting from low-cost 8 bit micro controllers up to powerful single board computers that can run Linux. The metering platform features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation of the current measurement unit. The suggested design can switch loads, offers a variable sampling frequency, and provides measurement data such as active power, reactive and apparent power. Results indicate that measurement accuracy and resolution of the proposed metering platform are sufficient for a range of different applications and loads from a few watts up to 5 kW. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this work, a new open hardware interface based on Arduino to read electromotive force (emf) from potentiometric detectors is presented. The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)-based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA+-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA+ content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment. Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science. © The Author 2015.

AB  - The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - OpenPET is an open source, modular, extendible, and high-performance platform suitable for multi-channel data acquisition and analysis. Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Objective The current study aimed to compare the Philadelphia collar and an open-design cervical collar with regard to user satisfaction and cervical range of motion in asymptomatic adults. Design Seventy-Two healthy subjects (36 women, 36 men) aged 18 to 29 yrs were recruited for this study. Neck movements, including active flexion, extension, right/left lateral flexion, and right/left axial rotation, were assessed in each subject under three conditions-without wearing a collar and while wearing two different cervical collars-using a dual digital inclinometer. Subject satisfaction was assessed using a five-item self-Administered questionnaire. Results Both Philadelphia and open-design collars significantly reduced cervical motions (P < 0.05). Compared with the Philadelphia collar, the open-design collar more greatly reduced cervical motions in three planes and the differences were statistically significant except for limiting flexion. Satisfaction scores for Philadelphia and open-design collars were 15.89 (3.87) and 19.94 (3.11), respectively. Conclusion Based on the data of the 72 subjects presented in this study, the open-design collar adequately immobilized the cervical spine as a semirigid collar and was considered cosmetically acceptable, at least for subjects aged younger than 30 yrs.

AB  - This article considers the practice of hacking in terms of making and modifying three-dimensional objects. In line with the work of a number of prominent thinkers in the field, the practice is considered to be a deliberate act by end users to not only understand, make accessible, de-alienate, appropriate and personalise products but also to demystify what Latour refers to as the ‘black box’ effect of established product archetypes. Where hacking is typically considered a post-production process, it is argued here that upfront, design-led approaches intended to harness downstream end-user post-production hacking (pre-hack) are in line with Jones’ call from over three decades ago for design divergence and continuity through collaborative processes – which we now find in the field of Open Design. This is discussed in light of the broader context of sustainability, which needs innovation from the ground up as well as top down. © 2016, The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Open reduction internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures is often accomplished with proximal humerus locking plates. While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by previous screw holes. © 2016 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

AB  - Due to the low cost of easy-to-use components of open-source hardware and software, the Internet of Things may be pervading through everything everywhere. The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The complexity of a particle accelerator implies the remote control of very large numbers of devices, with many different typologies, either distributed along the accelerator or concentrated in locations, often far away from each other. Local and global control systems handle the devices through dedicated communication channels and interfaces. Each controlled device is practically a 'smart node' performing a specific task. In addition, very often, those tasks are managed in real-time mode. The performances required to the control interface has an influence on the cost of the distributed nodes as well as on their hardware and software implementation. In large facilities (e.g. CERN) the 'smart nodes' derive from specific in-house developments. Alternatively, it is possible to find on the market commercial devices, whose performances (and prices) are spread over a broad range, and spanning from proprietary design (customizable to the user's needs) to open source/design. In this paper, we will describe some applications of smart nodes in the particle accelerators field, with special focus on the power supplies for magnets. In modern accelerators, in fact, magnets and their associated power supplies constitute systems distributed along the accelerator itself, and strongly interfaced with the remote control system as well as with more specific (and often more demanding) orbit/trajectory feedback systems. We will give examples of actual systems, installed and operational on two light sources, Elettra and FERMI, located in the Elettra Research Center in Trieste, Italy. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by different water quality related components (such as the presence of phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation Kd coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Environmental data are critical to understanding environmental phenomena, yet their consistent collection and curation can be cost-prohibitive. This paper describes a recipe for the design, development, and deployment of a low-cost environmental data logging and transmission system for environmental sensors and its connection to an open source data-sharing network. The hardware is built using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system automatically ingests data into HydroServer, a standards-based server in the open source hydrologic information system (HIS) created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI). By publishing data in this way, they are discoverable through the geographic information system (GIS)-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. In addition, because they follow WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalog such as the global earth observation system of system catalog. A recipe for building the system is provided. Multiple deployments used to test proof-of-concept of the system are described and their results are given. Ease of deployment and reliability of the logging and transmission system is also addressed. © IWA Publishing 2016.

AB  - The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - In this article, I explore the responses of the Open Source community to the Fukushima disaster by describing the development of collaborative technologies to measure radioactive contamination across Japan. Based on participant observation at Tokyo Hacker Space, this article addresses an emergent form of technoscientific expertise which is not confined to or legitimized by established institutions, but, rather, is distributed and organized around transnational networks of field specialists, companies, educational institutions, and volunteers. Both Tokyo Hacker Space, as an independent laboratory, and Safecast, as a spin-off project, advanced practices of hardware engineering and Open data management, which are examined in this article as manifestations of bricolage. As a concluding argument, I suggest that expertise and responsibility are interpretive keys for understanding the possibilities and impossibilities of collaboration and coordination in the context of Open Source-based responses to the Fukushima crisis. Responsibility has become an open question for Safecast and Tokyo Hacker Space, as both have championed "openness" as an ethical point of departure, a projected outcome, and a technical orientation in the context of the Fukushima disaster. © 2016 by the Institute for Ethnographic Research (IFER) a part of The George Washington University.

AB  - From a transdisciplinary standpoint, we need to address the environmental, economic, social and cultural dimensions of sustainability by calling attention to the key role of social sciences in working with other experts and in engaging stakeholders. This article is focused on present and potential direct contributions from social scientists in the practical realms of designing, producing and using sustainable technologies, while also arguing that more active interventions are not only desirable, but considerably urgent from start to end in these realms. In addition, we argue that such interventions are now facing promising opportunities with upcoming technological trends that range from open design and new maker cultures to rapid prototyping or digital fabrication. These trends already offer several openness routes in technology creation, and consequently foster wider practical and conceptual transdisciplinary platforms to envision, build and share not only physical objects but also the ideas and discussions that constitute them. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and reliability of supervised objects over a long period. Several commercial hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring measurements are available on the market. In addition to them, a research team at the University of Applied Sciences in Neubrandenburg (NUAS) is actively developing a software package for monitoring purposes in geodesy and geotechnics, which is distributed under an open source licence and free of charge. The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data management in automatic deformation monitoring. It will be discussed how the development effort of networked applications can be reduced by using free programming tools, cloud computing technologies, and rapid prototyping methods. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Munich/Boston.

AB  - Mass transport systems are vital for big cities and their disruption may have severe consequences for the economy, safety and security of the general public. Thus far, the attacks on mass transport have been about twice as lethal as terrorist attacks overall. Mass transport systems are typically of open design layout with multiple access points, and these characteristics make the process of screening challenging. Therefore, the early identification of an attack plan is the most efficient way to protect such systems. This paper aims to better understand the attack phenomenon and to develop a new approach for the systematic identification of possible weak signals and their sources. If such weak signals can be timely detected and correctly interpreted, this could improve awareness and thus possibilities for intervention. The developed approach is demonstrated by applying it to two well-known but different cases: the Tokyo sarin attack of 1995 and the 2005 London bombings. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Several psychosocial, family-focused evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for youth with disruptive behavior have proven effective in practice settings. However, limited research has examined community implementation of EBTs for pediatric depression and bipolar disorder. This pilot open trial evaluated multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP) with 41 children ages 7 to 12 (54% male, 92% Caucasian) with mood disorders and their parents in an outpatient setting. MF-PEP is an 8-session, adjunctive EBT with parallel child and parent groups. Fourteen community therapists facilitated 6 MF-PEP groups at 3 agencies over 2 years. Developed checklists were used to evaluate adherence. Clinical outcomes were measured via clinician assessment and self-report questionnaires at pretreatment, posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up, and analyzed via hierarchical linear modeling. Therapist group adherence ranged from 66.71% to 78.68% (M = 72.14%, SD = 4.85). Children experienced significant improvement in depressive and manic symptoms, and parents reported a significant increase in knowledge of mood disorders. Children with bipolar disorder and families with limited treatment history benefitted most from MF-PEP. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranged from small to large for mood outcomes (d = 0.34 to 1.18), knowledge (d = 1.02), and treatment beliefs (d = 0.04 to 0.41). Limitations included small sample, missing data, and open design. Results suggest that MF-PEP may be impactful for families affected by pediatric mood disorders in the community, especially among youth with bipolar disorder and families novice to treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more definitive evidence for the effectiveness of MF-PEP in practice settings. © 2016 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Objective: Hypnosis is classically presented as a useful psychotherapy for various psychiatric conditions, especially in the field of stress and anxiety. However, its place in therapeutic of chronic anxiety disorders remains unclear and questioned. Thus, the goal of this systematic review was to analyse the papers reporting clinical data on the efficacy of hypnosis in anxiety disorders. Methods: A literature search was conducted on Pubmed to retrieve all original papers, published between 1980 and 2015, reporting clinical information on the efficacy of hypnosis in six categories of anxiety disorders. Each paper has been assessed from a methodological point of view, and the results have been analysed. Results: Only three controlled studies have been identified, one in panic disorder and two in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The other papers related open-design studies (4 articles), or single case reports (20 articles). The controlled study conducted in panic disorder suggested that the combination of hypnosis with cognitive-behavior therapy was not an effective strategy, and this negative result was also obtained in one of the studies conducted in PTSD. The third study, including 48 Indonesian children with PTSD, showed a significant improvement with a specific hypnosis technique adapted to the local culture. Other papers related also positive results but in non-controlled studies or in case reports, their conclusions cannot be generalized. Conclusion: To date, evidence is negative or insufficient to support the efficacy of hypnosis in chronic anxiety disorders, in any categories whatsoever - including phobia or PTSD. Specific further studies are needed to identify some potential profiles predictive of response to hypnosis in these conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objectives Deprescribing has been proposed as a way to reduce polypharmacy in frail older people. We aimed to reduce the number of medicines consumed by people living in residential aged care facilities (RACF). Secondary objectives were to explore the effect of deprescribing on survival, falls, fractures, hospital admissions, cognitive, physical, and bowel function, quality of life, and sleep. Methods Ninety-five people aged over 65 years living in four RACF in rural mid-west Western Australia were randomised in an open study. The intervention group (n = 47) received a deprescribing intervention, the planned cessation of non-beneficial medicines. The control group (n = 48) received usual care. Participants were monitored for twelve months from randomisation. Primary outcome was change in the mean number of unique regular medicines. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, six, and twelve months. Results Study participants had a mean age of 84.3±6.9 years and 52% were female. Intervention group participants consumed 9.6±5.0 and control group participants consumed 9.5±3.6 unique regular medicines at baseline. Of the 348 medicines targeted for deprescribing (7.4 ±3.8 per person, 78% of regular medicines), 207 medicines (4.4±3.4 per person, 59% of targeted medicines) were successfully discontinued. The mean change in number of regular medicines at 12 months was -1.9±4.1 in intervention group participants and +0.1±3.5 in control group participants (estimated difference 2.0±0.9, 95%CI 0.08, 3.8, p = 0.04). Twelve intervention participants and 19 control participants died within 12 months of randomisation (26% versus 40% mortality, p = 0.16, HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.30 to 1.22) There were no significant differences between groups in other secondary outcomes. The main limitations of this study were the open design and small participant numbers. Conclusions Deprescribing reduced the number of regular medicines consumed by frail older people living in residential care with no significant adverse effects on survival or other clinical outcomes. © 2016 Potter et al.

AB  - This paper reports on the design of an open source-based control platform for the underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Visor3. The vehicle’s original closed source-based control platform is first described. Due to the limitations of the previous infrastructure, modularity and flexibility are identified as the main guidelines for the proposed design. This new design includes hardware, firmware, software, and control architectures. Open-source hardware and software platforms are used for the development of the new system’s architecture, with support from the literature and the extensive experience acquired with the development of robotic exploration systems. This modular approach results in several frameworks that facilitate the functional expansion of the whole solution, the simplification of fault diagnosis and repair processes, and the reduction of development time, to mention a few. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 × 8 × 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 μm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18-X 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots. Originality/value: The methodology of the intelligent robot design for highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - We describe an autonomous, fully functional implementation of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using open source hardware microcontrollers for the synchronization, communication, key sifting and real-time key generation diagnostics. The quantum bits are prepared in the polarization of weak optical pulses generated with light emitting diodes, and detected using a sole single-photon counter and a temporally multiplexed scheme. The system generates a shared cryptographic key at a rate of 365 bps, with a raw quantum bit error rate of 2.7%. A detailed description of the peripheral electronics for control, driving and communication between stages is released as supplementary material. The device can be built using simple and reliable hardware and it is presented as an alternative for a practical realization of sophisticated, yet accessible quantum key distribution systems. © 2016, Instituto de Fisica de Liquidos y Sistemas Biologicos.

AB  - This case study is a description of the open design community. The study identifies the main characteristics and methods of operation that frame and drive activities in the community. Qualitative research methods were mainly employed to gather and analyse the data. Work in the open design community is collaborative; it is a symbiosis of interests between profit-making companies and members of the community resulting in win–win situations. A word spin in the title of this paper indicates fast turns in the practices of the open design community. The study also proposes a potential direction for the future development of self-sufficient design and production of artefacts, platforms and services in an almost untouched area of scientific research. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Arduino is a popular open source hardware toolkit for science and engineering education due to its easy use and various good examples. But, students or beginners who have no experience and knowledge of electronic engineering or programming languages still feel a considerable barrier to use Arduino. This study analyzes the barrier of beginners in using the open source hardware. In order to resolve the difficulty in firmware programming, we adopt a functional concise script composed of simplified service commands and minimum options to use the open hardware and proposes a new script-based open source hardware programming environment. From the comparison result with previous development toolkit, we confirm that the programming by the proposed script-based simple programming toolkit is substantially simple by adopting simple script and automatic generations of irrelevant instructions, type declarations and semicolons in programming the open source hardware of Arduino. © 2016 SERSC.

AB  - One of the most cost effective ways to make system control (automation) is by using open source hardware and software, in order to be cost oriented besides the price the systems need to be implemented in reasonable time frame and also needs to be reliable and safe. In this paper we will treat and justify the cases of using the Open Source Hardware and Software, in comparison to industry standard Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Also we will discuss about the point of system complexity where the cost reduction will not justify the time spend to build the interfacing of sensors, digital and analog I/O for the open source Hardware. © 2016

AB  - Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker- and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - With the emergence and wide application of digital fabrication equipment and open source hardware, the maker movement, featuring cooperative innovation and user self-production, is a new trend around the globe. Because of its close and natural relationship with engineering and technology, it has drawn the attention of educators in this field. From two perspectives - digital tools and maker space, the authors of this article summarise and analyse cases of maker space education in engineering and technology. Based on the analysis of educational rationales and learning methods of maker space education, a conceptual model of maker space education is devised. Then, the influence of maker movement on engineering and technology education is discussed, and possible related future topics are raised. © 2016 WIETE.

AB  - Soldercubes are a self-reconfiguring modular robot (MR) system whose modules are light weight, low cost, and designed with manufacturability for large batch production in mind. The frequently cited promises of modular robotics—versatility, robustness, and low cost—assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open source hardware. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements. © 2015.

AB  - The development of techniques for the rapid analysis of N-glycans is a key step in enabling the roles of glycoproteins in biological processes to be studied. Analysis is usually performed through the liberation of the carbohydrate moieties from proteins, followed by fluorescent labeling and identification using either standardized HPLC or mass spectrometry techniques. A simple and robust automated process for the release and isolation of N-glycans would greatly improve analytical throughput and reproducibility, and is thus highly desirable. Inspired by the increasing number of reported projects involving open source labware, which allows the design and construction of otherwise inaccessible laboratory equipment using low-cost 3D printers, we used this technique to fabricate a platform for the automated isolation of N-glycans. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the successful recovery of glycan samples from the glycoprotein model fetuin using our self-made 3D-printed equipment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This case study explores the opportunities for students of Industrial Design Engineering to engage with direct and indirect stakeholders by making their design process and results into open-ended designed solutions. The reported case study involved 47 students during a two-weeks intensive course on the topic of urban gardening. Observations were collected during three distinctive phases: the co-design phase, the creation of an open design, and the sharing of these design solutions on the online platform Instructables.com.The open sharing of local solutions triggered more global discussions, based on several types of feedback: from simple questions to reference to existing works and from suggestions to critiques. Also, some examples of re-appropriation of the designed solutions were reported. These feedbacks show the possibilities for students to have a global vision on their local solutions, confronting them with a wider and more diverse audience. The case study shows, on the other hand, the difficulty in keeping students engaged in this global discussion, considering how after a few weeks the online discussions dropped to an almost complete silence. It is also very difficult with such online platforms to follow the re-appropriation cycles, losing the possibility of exploring the new local context where the replication/modification of the designed product occurred. The course's focus on open design is interesting from both the design and educational points of view. It implies a deep change in the teaching approach and learning attitude of students, allowing unknown peers to take part in the design process and fostering a global discussion starting from unique and local solutions.

AB  - The reasons for the inferior performance of many existing buildings and associated energy systems are diverse, but an important part-cause is insufficient attention to the influence of occupant behaviour. In smart buildings it is necessary to allow for the integration of human behaviour in the HVAC system. In addition, many researchers are limited in their investigation by not having low cost tools that can provide information for their studies. This article is a review of the present state of art about the globe thermometer. It describes how to build your own globe temperature sensor and describes experiments that illustrate the feasibility of using a black globe thermometer with 40 mm diameter.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a personal viewpoint on the development of document supply in the context of the recent European Union (EU) decisions on open science. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides some elements to the usual questions of service development, about business, customers, added value, environment and objectives. Findings: The EU goal for open science is 100 per cent available research results in 2020. To meet the challenge, document supply must change, include more and other content, serve different targets groups, apply innovative technology and provide knowledge. If not, document supply will become a marginalized library service. Originality/value: Basically, open science is not library-friendly, and it does not offer a solution for the actual problems of document supply. But it may provide an opportunity for document supply to become a modern service able to deal with new forms of unequal access and digital divide. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The advent of massively interconnected objects, devices, and sensors raises equally substantial challenges regarding the resources that will allow makers to manage the complexity of such systems and to exploit the opportunities such technologies open up. Simplicity in management and a smooth, creative integration of everyday life objects empowered by digital technology in our own environment are two key factors for a successful penetration of Internet of Things (IoT). We present UDOO IoT, a combined set of open hardware (UDOO Quad, Blu and Bricks) and open software (UAPPI, an extension of MIT App Inventor) technologies that allow novices from their early steps in the maker's world to create their own digital objects connected to the cloud, easily defining custom behavior logic for sensors and actuators. UDOO IoT is illustrated through one of the field studies carried out along its design process.

AB  - Precision Agriculture in conjunction with Variable Rate Technology aims at increasing productivity while reducing resource usage (water, fertilizers, pesticides and others). Within this context, the farm's management decisions include information from data collected about the crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis. There are several means of obtaining information about the plants health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery, to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access, low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely Raspberry Pi boards, that are used to collect, process and store information. © 2016

AB  - Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario. © 2016 L.

AB  - Automated driving may lead to much higher road capacities, combined with increased road safety, increased driver comfort, and lower costs. Although this vision may hold ground in the long run, first a transitional period will take place in which increasing percentages of vehicles with many levels of automation will drive on the world's road networks. This transition poses a fundamental scientific challenge. The models used today to simulate and predict vehicular traffic are not valid to predict emergent properties of traffic flows under increasing amounts of vehicle automation. For example, there is no idea of how drivers of nonautomated vehicles will respond to other drivers reading their morning papers behind the steering wheel or the consequences of such interactions on traffic safety and capacity. In this paper, the authors do not propose a new behavioral theory with which the effects of increasing vehicle automation can be predicted. What the authors propose is an advanced open-source simulation framework, OpenTrafficSim, which makes it possible to extend microscopic models incrementally with explanatory mental models, such that new behavioral theories can be tested and shared within the community. Given the societal importance of predicting the effects on safety and efficiency of vehicle automation, the authors sincerely hope this paper will fuel the discussion on how both open-source and closed-source simulation software can be adapted and made ready for the next generation of traffic simulation models that are needed in the coming decades.

AB  - Existing seeder openers for intrasoil broadcast sowing of grain crops do not fully provide quality seeds scattering. Low nonuniformity of seeds scattering can be assured by vibro-distributers but they have a complicated design. An original opener design for quality intrasoil broadcast sowing is proposed. The V-shaped sweep of the opener consists of cutting blades which create a closed subsoil space. A pendulum scatterer in the form of a hemisphere is pivotally suspended inside. Theoretical studies are based on classical mechanics. As a result of theoretical investigation, an expression is obtained for determination of the length of a grain fallen in the under-sweep space. The optimal parameters of the scatterer are determined experimentally: it s base diameter, its height and its location according to the bottom of the furrow. © 2016, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

AB  - We implemented an educational program, based on the use of free software and low-cost open hardware, to excite high school students' curiosity about seismic-hazard issues and to engage them in the process of learning the best practices of seismic safety. This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a "how-To" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.

AB  - Energy harvesting systems that couple solar panels with supercapacitor buffers offer an attractive option for powering computational systems deployed in field settings, where power infrastructure is inaccessible. Supercapacitors offer a particularly compelling advantage over electrochemical batteries for such settings because of their ability to survive many more charge-discharge cycles. We share UR-SolarCap - a versatile open source design for such a harvesting system that targets embedded system applications requiring power in the 1-10 W range. Our system is designed for high efficiency and controllability and, importantly, supports auto-wakeup from a state of complete energy depletion. This paper summarizes our design methodology, and the rationale behind our design and configuration decisions. Results from the operation and testing of a system realized with our design demonstrate: 1) an achievable harvester efficiency of 85%; 2) the ability to maintain sustained operation over a two week period when the solar panel and buffer are sized appropriately; and 3) a robust auto-wakeup functionality that resumes system operation upon the availability of harvestable energy after a period in which the system has been forced into a dormant state because of a lack of usable energy. To facilitate the use of the system by researchers exploring embedded system applications in environments that lack a power infrastructure, our designs are available for download as an archive containing design schematics, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) files, firmware code, and a component list for assembly of the system. In addition, a limited number of pre-assembled kits are available upon request. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The open design of disc brake and its location close to the road surface may lead the road particles of various sizes and shapes to enter in between brake pads and disc rotor. This study presents an experimental approach to determine the particle shape effect on friction and wear characteristics of OEM disc brake under different operating condition. Two types of external particles which are road particles and silica sand with two range of size of 200 μm and 400 μm were used. Testing was conducted for variable load and sliding speed. Presence of external particle with various size and shape affect the wear rate, friction coefficient and surface topography of the brake pad. Smaller particle generated more wear. Moreover, the particles which have sharped shape or high angularity resulted in higher weight loss of the pad and contribute to greater formation of compacted wear debris. Wear rate and friction coefficient also increase with contact pressure. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper presents the main provisions of the new theory of oscillations of the versatile combined opener assembly of the breeding seed drill with a spring-suspended furrow opening toothed disc in the vertical longitudinal plane during its movement across irregularities of the soil surface. Basing on the improved design of the opener assembly, an equivalent schematic model has been developed, which takes into account the forces applied to the structural components of the opener, forces in the springs as well as the reaction of the soil acting on the toothed disc, the hoe-type seed conductor and the packing wheel. The system of differential equations has been set up, which describes the movement of the opener across irregularities of the soil surface depending on the opener’s design parameters and the kinematic modes of performing the drilling work process. The derived mathematical model makes it possible to determine the amplitudes and frequencies of the translational oscillations of the device in order to assess their impact on the drilling work process. The developed theory provides also tools for the assessment and lowering of the energy characteristics of the versatile breeding seed drill related to the oscillating movements of its openers in soil. © 2016, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - The paper explores the change process that university teachers need to go through in order to become fluent with Open Education approaches. Based on a literature review and a set of interviews with a number of leading experts in the field of Open Educational Resources and Open Education, the paper puts forward an original definition of Open Educator which takes into account all the components of teachers' work: learning design, teaching resources, pedagogical approaches and assessment methods- of teachers' activities. Subsequently, to help the development of teachers' openness capacity, the definition is further developed into a holistic framework for teachers, which takes into account all the dimensions of openness included in the definition and which provides teachers with self-development paths along each dimension. By working on the definition and on the framework with the interviewed experts, the paper concludes that a strong relation exists between the use of open approaches and the networking and collaboration attitude of university teachers, and that in order to overcome the technical and cultural barriers that hinder the use of open approaches in Higher Education, it is important to work on the transition phases - in terms of awareness and of capacity building - that teachers have to go through in their journey towards openness.

AB  - To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943, ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per alloy basis and also layer-by-layer in order to evaluate the device's efficacy as a monitoring device for 3-D printing and the results of the integrated design are discussed. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - IN THE WAKE OF the Fukushima disaster in 2011, a lot of people in Japan felt the government was not giving them enough information about radiation, so many went out and bought their own Geiger counters. Supplies quickly ran dry, so a group gathered in Tokyo's Hackerspace to design and build their own under the name Safecast. Before they did anything, they consulted the Internet. Joichi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab and founding member of Safecast, explained at the group's anniversary and conference in March this year: "When we had the earthquake, most of us didn't know about radiation or even starting up communities. We called out on the Internet, asking: 'Do you know anything about this?' Someone would say 'I know the person who did the monitoring sensors for Three Mile Island'. "We put together quite a good team having started from zero. We couldn't have designed this as quickly without open hardware or without the help of the Internet. That is a big trend that we are seeing the beginning of." The result of the hacking project was the bGeigie, a combination of a Geiger counter, GPS receiver and data recorder. Users submit their data to the Safecast database by uploading it from the bGeigie's SD card, usually from a network-enabled computer rather than the device itself. Ray Ozzie, former chief software architect of Microsoft and the adviser to Safecast, came up with the idea of putting the small initial number of handmade Geiger counters on the outside of car windows, so they could be driven round to maximise the number of readings around Japan that the team could record.

AB  - The article describes the design phase, development and practical application of a low-cost control system for a forced circulation solar plant in an outdoor test cell located near Milan. Such a system provides for the use of an electric pump for the circulation of heat transfer fluid connecting the solar thermal panel to the storage tank. The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We demonstrate the additive manufacturing of complex three-dimensional (3D) biological structures using soft protein and polysaccharide hydrogels that are challenging or impossible to create using traditional fabrication approaches. These structures are built by embedding the printed hydrogel within a secondary hydrogel that serves as a temporary, thermoreversible, and biocompatible support. This process, termed freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels, enables 3D printing of hydrated materials with an elastic modulus <500 kPa including alginate, collagen, and fibrin. Computer-aided design models of 3D optical, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging data were 3D printed at a resolution of ~200 mm and at low cost by leveraging open-source hardware and software tools. Proof-of-concept structures based on femurs, branched coronary arteries, trabeculated embryonic hearts, and human brains were mechanically robust and recreated complex 3D internal and external anatomical architectures. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - We describe a completely randomizable flow-through outdoor mesocosm for climate change and ecotoxicology studies that was built with inexpensive materials. The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 69 water renewal per hour, avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH up to −0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6℃ in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a 40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification, and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and consistent treatment manipulations. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The Cleveland water system in Ohio began operation on September 24, 1856. The system was designed by the city's chief engineer at the time, T.R. Scowden. Disinfection of the water supply with the use of chlorine gas was introduced in 1911 at the urging of the city's chief bacteriologist, Roger G. Perkin. The original filter gallery was an open design, allowing unfettered operator access to the filters. The new gallery has additional lighting designed to match the style of the original lighting. Forty filters were provided to remove any remaining particulates. During the 1960s and 1970s, the triple-expansion steam pump engines were replaced with electric motors. In 1988, the residuals-handling facilities were updated to begin disposal through the regional sewer district. In 1994, orthophosphate addition was initiated for corrosion control under the Lead and Copper Rule. In 1997 Cleveland Water embarked on the Plant Enhancement Program (PEP), an effort to rehabilitate and modernize its four water treatment plants. A major component of the PEP renovation at Baldwin was the installation of automation. Opera?tors can now monitor and control the entire plant, including the remote raw water pump station and finished water pumping station, from the control room.

AB  - From the rising number of hackerspaces to an increase in hardware start-ups, maker culture is envisioned as an enabler of the next industrial revolution—a source of unhindered technological innovation, a revamp of broken economies and educational systems. Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China’s makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China’s makers demonstrate that the future of making—if to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industry—rests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China’s first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China’s makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of “hacking with Chinese characteristics,” they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines. This article contributes to critical scholarship of innovation and making cultures, technological expertise, and authorship. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Precision agriculture combines the use of information and technology to ensure the best agricultural practices. Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this system in precision agriculture are presented. © 2015 IAgrE.

AB  - This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3-D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We present a novel approach to developing a vehicle communication platform consisting of a low-cost, open-source hardware for moving vehicle data to a secure server, a Web Application Programming Interface (API) for the provision of third-party services, and an intuitive user dashboard for access control and service distribution. The CloudThink infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure and set will accelerate its adoption. © 2015 © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - Telemonitoring systems, including Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), are an important support for the monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. This article shows the development and evaluation process of VISIGNET, a prototype open hardware interoperable vital signs monitoring system that captures data of clinical variables from a patient and sends them to a cloud-based service for their remote visualization. The article first presents a synthesis of the system design, which consists of a WBAN that captures data from three sensors, namely heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. Then, it explains the WBAN operation and the data transmission process to Xively, a cloud service. Finally, this article shows the findings of the evaluation of the system, analyzing parameters like coverage, the Frame Error Rate (FER), end-to-end delay, and the battery life of the sensors. It also shows the implementation of a case study with 100 patients from two health centers. © IUPESM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

AB  - Today, open source software plays a significant role in information technology and consumer electronics. Open source hardware, which is the free exchange of a product's design information, is gaining popularity as well. Both ideologies are motivated by trading away competition against collaboration. In this paper we suggest the application of the open source movement to space technology. In the focus of our discussion are CubeSats, considered as an ideal playground for the introduction of technological and methodological novelties. We examine the legal background of open source designs and contrast the advantages of open source products for developers and users against closed source products. We then present an open source initiative for CubeSat technologies with the intention to encourage the CubeSat community to move towards open design. © 2015 IAA.Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability has become a major concern in many countries and is leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and services during their manufacturing, use, and disposal. Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %. Solutions are suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool considered in this work. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of the environment in relation to the health and well-being of the occupants. It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board’s memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and potential applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: To evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental intervention based on standard diet recommendations plus free Smartphone application (app) and wearable device for weight loss, compared with the standard diet intervention alone, in primary care patients aged 18 years or older who are overweight or obese. Methods/design: Multicentre randomized, controlled clinical trial. Location: Primary health care centres in the city of Tarragona and surrounding areas. Subjects: 70 primary care patients, aged 18 years or older, with body mass index of 25 g/m2 or greater who wish to lose weight. Description of the intervention: 12 months of standard diet recommendations without (n = 35) or with (n = 35) assistance of a free Smartphone app that allows the participant to maintain a record of dietary intake and a bracelet monitor that records physical activity. The outcomes will be weight loss at 12 months (primary outcome), changes in physical activity and cardiometabolic risk factors, frequency of app use, and participant satisfaction after 12 months. Discussion: The results of our study will offer evidence of the effectiveness of an intervention using one of the most popular free apps and wearable devices in achieving weight loss among patients who are overweight or obese. If these new technologies are proven effective in our population, they could be readily incorporated into primary care interventions promoting healthy weight. The open design and study characteristics make it impossible for the participants and researchers to be blinded to study group assignment. Researchers responsible for data analysis will be blinded to participant allocation. Trial registration: Clinical Register: NCT02417623. Registered 26 March 2015. © 2015 Granado-Font et al.

AB  - Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The new open-source software and hardware matrix deposition device named iMatrixSpray was optimized and specified for homogeneity, reproducibility, and sensitivity in MS imaging experiments. The results confirm the design claims, with the device delivering uniform coatings with a constant quality from experiment to experiment. The robustness in combination with the open design allows developing and sharing of matrix deposition and sample preparation protocols between labs. This tool therefore enables researchers to enter the field of MALDI MSI without previous experience in matrix coating.

AB  - The Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP) is a public/private partnership established through the World Bank to improve food safety systems through a globally coordinated and locally-driven approach. This concept paper aims to establish a framework to help GFSP fully leverage the potential of open models. In preparing this paper the authors spoke to many different GFSP stakeholders who asked questions about open models such as: what is it? what's in it for me? why use an open rather than a proprietary model? how will open models generate equivalent or greater sustainable revenue streams compared to the current "traditional? approaches? This last question came up many times with assertions that traditional service providers need to see opportunity for equivalent or greater revenue dollars before they will buy-in. This paper identifies open value propositions for GFSP stakeholders and proposes a framework for creating and structuring that value. Open Educational Resources (OER) were the primary open practice GFSP partners spoke to us about, as they provide a logical entry point for collaboration. Going forward, funders should consider requiring that educational resources and concomitant data resulting from their sponsorship should be open, as a public good. There are, however, many other forms of open practice that bring value to the GFSP. Nine different open strategies and tactics (Appendix A) are described, including: open content (including OER and open courseware), open data, open access (research), open government, open source software, open standards, open policy, open licensing and open hardware. It is recommended that all stakeholders proactively pursue "openness" as an operating principle. This paper presents an overall GFSP Open Ecosystem Engagement Strategy within which specific local case examples can be situated. Two different case examples, China and Colombia, are presented to show both project-based and crowd-sourced, direct-to-public paths through this ecosystem. © 2015 Stacey P et al.

AB  - A majority of black carbon (BC) emitted to the atmosphere in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region is from burning biomass fuel used in traditional, open-design cookstoves. However, BC and particulate matter (PM) household emissions are not well characterized. Household emission information is needed to develop emission profiles to validate regional climate change models and serve as a baseline for assessing the impact of adopting improved stove technology. This paper presents field-based household PM and BC exfiltration (amount exiting) estimates from village homes in rural Nepal that utilize traditional, open-design cookstoves. Use of these stoves resulted in a 26% mean PM exfiltration, ranging from 6% to 58%. This is a significant departure from an 80% estimate cited in previous reports. Furthermore, having a window/door resulted in an 11% increase in exfiltration when an opening was present, while fuel type had a marginally significant impact on emission. Air-exchange rates (AER) were determined with average (95% CI) AER of 12 (10-14) per hour, consistent with previous studies. In addition, BC to PM<inf>2.5</inf> mass-ratio composition during cooking was ascertained, with an average (95% CI) of 31% (24-39), agreeing with previous biomass fuel emission composition literature. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Non-contacting acoustic and ultrasonic measurements are of interest in applications ranging from nondestructive evaluation to rock physics and medical imaging. The fundamental workings of the detector - the interferometer - are easily explained in undergraduate physics courses, but practical implementations are dominated by specialized, and commercial, devices. We present a robust and relatively inexpensive detector, which consists of a heterodyne interferometer and phase locked loop frequency demodulator, as an open-source alternative. We illustrate the broadband capabilities with the detection of ultrasonic waves in a mudstone sample, and low-frequency (100 Hz) vibrations of a piston. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) applies constant electrical stimulation to specific brain regions to treat neurological disorders. Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.

AB  - Objective: The psychiatric emergency room is a dynamic and sometimes volatile environment. Its design may be an important variable in patient care, but most design decisions are based on models of thought and treatment with a minimal evidence base. Background: The concept of open design, increasing access of patients to nursing staff, for inpatient psychiatric units has recently gained widespread acceptance, despite a dearth of empirical data. Methods: We examined rates of seclusion and restraint before and after a design change that reduced the openness of the unit in a dedicated emergency psychiatric service in a general university hospital. Quality assurance data regarding the census, occurrence of assaults, and the use of seclusion and restraint were queried. Two independent analyses utilizing a test of proportional data were performed to replicate the findings. Results: After placement of a door to restrict patients' access to the waiting area of the unit, the rate of the use of seclusion and restraint went from 0.03 (44/777) to 0.0185 (27/1,514; z 1/4 2.02, p < .04). Replication over a separate time period saw reduction from 0.029 (67/2,277) to 0.018 (44/2,431), z 1/4 2.44, p < .02). Conclusion: A design change that reduced the openness of the unit resulted in the reduction of seclusion and restraint. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - The introduction of affordable, consumer-oriented 3-D printers is a milestone in the current “maker movement,” which has been heralded as the next industrial revolution. Combined with free and open sharing of detailed design blueprints and accessible development tools, rapid prototypes of complex products can now be assembled in one’s own garage—a game-changer reminiscent of the early days of personal computing. At the same time, 3-D printing has also allowed the scientific and engineering community to build the “little things” that help a lab get up and running much faster and easier than ever before. © 2015 Baden et al.

AB  - The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality, with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer sectors. At the ‘thing’ level—devices and inter-device network communication—the core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - From 2012 to 2016 all teachers of mathematics, in primary through to upper secondary and adult education, in Sweden are to be given the opportunity of receiving state-coordinated professional development (PD), generally involving around one meeting per week for a year. We examine the ways in which this programme and its content are research-based by analysing the design principles of the PD and its content via a review of the underlying documents. We find that the research base for the design of the PD decisions is formulated only partly explicitly in the documentation, as is the case for the content. Nevertheless, the principles still largely conform to internationally recognised research-based models for PD and teacher change. In the discussion we propose that a relatively open design process, involving many stakeholders with knowledge of both theory and practice rather than an analytical examination of previous research, has contributed to the adoption of this format for the PD programme. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.

AB  - We present a robotic platform based on the open source RepRap 3D printer that can print and maintain chemical artificial life in the form of a dynamic, chemical droplet. The robot uses computer vision, a self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches to artificial life. © 2015 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - When the study on the relationship between the Head-of-Bed (HOB) angle and ventilator-associated pneumonia is performed, the fact that the HOB angle can only be measured intermittently imposes a significant limitation on the study. Therefore, there has been demand for the development of a device that can measure the HOB angle continuously. In this paper, we propose the rapid prototyping of an HOB measurement system using open-source hardware and software. The proposed system helps to maintain the HOB angle at a particular angle by displaying the angle and helps the medical study of pneumonia patients by enabling continuous data acquisition. Firstly, we eliminate the process of making an MCU board by utilizing an open-source hardware mbed LPC1768. Secondly, we reduce the software development time by using libraries and hence enabling the easy use of peripherals. Thirdly, for rapid prototyping, we build the enclosure of the proposed system using a 3D printer. The proposed system can be attached and detached to and from a bed. Therefore, we can attach it to the bed of a patient for whom measurement of the HOB angle is necessary. Finally, we check the measurement performance and the validity of the proposed system through an experiment utilizing an incremental encoder. © ICROS 2015.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a low cost Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) which consists of open source hardware and has three thrusters. First, the hardware of the vehicle, including the actuators, sensors, and control structure, is described. Second, to study the relationship between the thrust forces and the performance of the ROV, a mathematical model of the vehicle in the form of a kinematic and kinetic model is established. Next, a hybrid control algorithm consisting of two components, namely model-based and PID algorithms, is proposed for surge speed, depth, and heading control. The effectiveness of the hybrid control algorithm is then verified by the ROV mathematical model-based simulations. Finally, free running tests for depth control are conducted to verify the robustness and reliability of the control structure and proposed algorithms. © 2014, Fuji Technology Press.

AB  - To explore the influence of different participants' structure on the evolution of knowledge collaboration network in open source design community, the evolution process model was established and the mechanisms of agent-task knowledge matching, collaborative partner selection, knowledge spillover and knowledge growth were built. The simulation for evolution of knowledge collaboration network in open source design community was realized by using agent modeling. A series of simulation experiments were designed to research the influence for the evolution of knowledge collaboration network. The results showed that the communities' evolution speed was improved remarkably by increasing the percentage of skilled participants, but a gradual decline in skilled participants' advantage was appeared with the increase of skilled participants' number. Some management recommends for open source design community were given. ©, 2015, CIMS. All right reserved.

AB  - There has been some argument as to the legitimacy of the use of open-source technology (OST) in product design and manufacturing. Much of this has focused on intellectual property rights of the designer in the use of open-source software (OSS) and open-source hardware (OSH). Furthermore, in design education the question as to whether product design and industrial design students should learn to use open-source technology has been widely asked. This research addresses this question and considers commercial and non-commercial applications of open-source technology. The research methods comprised interviews and questionnaire survey with practicing designers and design students. The findings were analysed and discussed in relation to the growth in the application of open-source technology in commercial and educational settings. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - In indoor environments, where density of people will be high such as offices, industries, colleges, banks, hospitals and others, if we want to locate a particular person or if some information has to be passed, it will be hard for us to search for that person. In a hospital if we want to locate the patients, wheelchairs, stretches and any other necessary equipment or in a ware house where you want to locate a carton, this RFID (Radio frequency identification) based system will be very useful and the information can be passed in time without much effort. The reader, which is located in specific locations, scans the tags which are in its range and using the unique identification number assigned to the tag. This tag information, along with reader address is passed to the receiver section using wireless communication. A database is maintained with all the received data such as tag ID, reader address and time stamps. The movement and position of these tags can be known through this system. A kiosk enables a user to place a query and get necessary data. © Research India Publications.

AB  - The RepRap 3D printer development project is a fast growing, open-hardware initiative relying on the input of hobbyist designers. One of its key components is the printer nozzle. The performance and reliability deficiencies of currently available nozzle designs are common topics in the RepRap community, and our own experience with a RepRap 3D printer has identified a need for improvement in a few particular areas. We set out to eliminate melt leakage, improve thermal isolation, and develop a more effective method of nozzle assembly attachment. Here, we review the issues, describe design efforts, and report results. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The secure boot-up and setup of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected over the Cloud represent a challenging open issue. This paper deals with the automatic configuration of IoT devices in a secure way through the Cloud, in order to provide new addedvalue services. After a discussion on the limits of current IoT and Cloud solutions in terms of secure self-configuration, we present a Cloud-based architecture that allows IoT devices to interact with several federated Cloud providers. In particular, we present two possible scenarios, that is, single Cloud and a federated Cloud environments, interacting with IoT devices and we address specific issues of both. Moreover, we present several design highlights on how to operate considering real open hardware and software products already available in the market. © 2015 Antonio Puliafito et al.

AB  - What does open source mean for culture? For knowledge? As cultural production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer challenge the ‘dominant paradigm’ that knowledge and information should be protected and monetized, the logic of ‘open sourcing’ has extended into many cultural spheres. This article positions ‘openness’ as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of ‘openness’ from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses. The insights in this article are valuable for anyone studying open source and peer production processes and the knowledge claims surrounding them. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - There is no doubt that computer architecture represents a core course in computer science curriculum. A computer architecture course involves mainly the microprocessor structure and operation which constitutes the heart of the whole system. Due to microprocessor complexity, a number of simulation software solutions have been developed for supporting the corresponding courses. On the other hand, simulators offer only a visual environment where the students cannot change operational or structural characteristics for studying the corresponding microprocessor behavior. Moreover, and much more important is the fact that students cannot demystify the physical level where bit manipulation takes place. A novel and low cost approach for studying in depth microprocessor structure and operation at programming and hardware level is presented and finally proposed for the very first time in this paper. The student uses programmable hardware modules for developing the internal structure of a microprocessor. Finally, the developed microprocessor can be studied from programmer’s or developer’s view. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present TalkBox, an affordable and open-source communication board for users with communication or speech disorders. Making and tinkering methods are combined with community engagement and participatory design to create a democratic and accessible approach to assistive technology design. Design/methodology/approach – The authors employed a community-engaged participatory design methodology where we incorporated input from stakeholders into the design of the interface. Close collaboration with our community partner allowed us to make informed decisions on different aspects of the design from sourcing of the material to testing the prototype. Findings – Through describing TalkBox, the paper presents a concrete example of how assistive technology can be designed and deployed more democratically, how collaborations between academia and community partners can be established, and how the design reflects different aspects of the methodology used. Originality/value – This paper explores the question of how can open-source technology and making methods contribute to the development of more affordable and inclusive designs through a concrete example. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The aim of this work is the development of a network of wireless devices to determine, along with a time-stamp, postural changes of users that are to be used in personalized learning environments. For this purpose, we have designed a basic low-cost pressure sensor that can be built from components easily available. Several of these basic sensors (of sizes and shapes chosen specifically for the task) are integrated into a posture sensor cushion, which is electronically controlled by an Arduino microcontroller board. This accounts for experiments involving either a single cushion to be used by an individual end-user setting approach or classroom approaches where several of these cushions make up a sensor network via ZigBee wireless connections. The system thus formed is an excellent alternative to other more expensive commercial systems and provides a low-cost, easy-to-use, portable, scalable, autonomous, flexible solution with free hardware and software, which can be integrated with other sensing devices into a larger affect detection system, customizable to cope with postural changes at required time intervals and support single and collective oriented experimentation approaches. © 2015 Ricardo Barba et al.

AB  - Phenotyping has become the rate-limiting step in using large-scale genomic data to understand and improve agricultural crops. Here, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform for controlled-environment plant growth and automated multimodal phenotyping is described. The system has capacity for 1140 plants, which pass daily through stations to record fluorescence, near-infrared, and visible images. Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits. All ∼79 000 images acquired during the course of the experiment are publicly available. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - Summary An embedded model predictive controller (eMPC) based on the linear MPC module in Statoil Estimation and Prediction Tool for Identification and Control has been developed, and it is intended to facilitate the MPC application on embedded hardware. The control design approach illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable, constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Vascular stiffness is an indicator of cardiovascular health, with carotid artery stiffness having established correlation to coronary heart disease and utility in cardiovascular diagnosis and screening. State of art equipment for stiffness evaluation are expensive, require expertise to operate and not amenable for field deployment. In this context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The accuracy of results was verified with the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS measurement and sitting/supine postures for imaging system was also investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - ExpertEyes is a low-cost, open-source package of hardware and software that is designed to provide portable high-definition eyetracking. The project involves several technological innovations, including portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4° and best accuracy below 0.3°, and with a typical precision (SD method) around 0.3° and best precision below 0.2°. Part of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts. © 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Determination of moisture content of soil is absolutely crucial and must be performed frequently to assure the quality of construction work. In a view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes - supervised and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible, which results in at least 50% test time reduction.

AB  - In this paper a system is proposed to retrofit a two axes Computer Numeric Control machine with open software and hardware architecture. The main objective of the paper is to analyses the performance of an open controller and the corresponding hardware. The overall control is done by open software developed in Linux. The machine operation is tested by sending a sample data written in G-code to a two axis CNC lathe, retrofitted with open hardware and interfacing to LinuxCNC operating system. The machine input commands issued by the LinuxCNC are interpreted by the motion control card and trajectory control signals are generated.These signals are converted to motor drive pulses by an FPGA module. The I/O signal generated by the FPGA module is fed to the AC servo motors using servo drives. The motion control card communicates with the LinuxCNC based personal computer using PCIExpress bus. That will assist the machine tool designers to develop a more flexible and versatile open system and help the end users to reconfigure and restructure the system as per their own requirement at lower cost. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Arduino open-source microcontrollers are well known in sensor applications for scientific equipment and for controlling RepRap 3D printers. Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community. © 2015 A.

AB  - The lack of accessible quality healthcare is one of the biggest problems in Africa and other developing countries. This is not only due to the unavailability of resources, but also to the absence of a structured formative process for the design and management of healthcare facilities. Crucial to the effective and efficient exploitation of healthcare facilities and biomedical technology is the support of Biomedical engineers, who form the link between technology and medical practice. Indeed Biomedical engineers, together with nurses and doctors, form the pillars of healthcare systems in the developed world. In this paper, the Open Source for BioMedical Engineering (OS4BME) project and its kick off summer school are presented. The OS4BME project aims at developing a new generation of biomedical engineers, able to exploit emerging technologies generated by the recent "Makers" revolution. During the one week summer school, students from various sub-Saharan countries were introduced to these new design, development and sharing paradigms. Students worked together to identify new simple biomedical devices, which could help in daily clinical practice in their countries. A cheap and easy-to-use neonatal monitoring device was chosen as a Crowd design project. The OS4BME Baby Monitor was designed and assembled by the students during the one week summer school, demonstrating the creative potential of the new generation of biomedical engineers empowered with the paradigms of crowdsourcing and rapid prototyping. © 2015 by authors.

AB  - Safety-critical systems and certification standards are the bare essential elements for the development process of avionics, automotive and industrial embedded systems. The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safety-critical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safety- critical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real time oper ating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safety- critical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for in- dustrial machinery. © J.UCS.

AB  - Background: The effects of creatine on brain metabolism and the potential cognitive enhancing properties of this compound raise the possibility of developing a new augmentation therapeutic strategy in schizophrenia especially in patients demonstrating negative and cognitive symptomatology. Methods: Seven inpatients with chronic schizophrenia presenting with treatment resistant negative symptoms were enrolled into exploratory treatment study with creatine monohydrate augmentation at a daily high-dose of 10 grams, administered for 6 months. Several clinical rating scales and a computerized cognitive assessment battery were applied. Results: Creatine treatment mildly improved the schizophrenia symptomatology but there were no significant changes in cognitive functions. Several ward behaviors were also improved. Tardive parkinsonism improved numerically by above 40% in 4 out of 6 patients. Conclusion: This small, open design study of high dose creatine add-on for 6 months in chronic inpatients with schizophrenia demonstrated only mild positive effects on the patients’ symptomatology and behavior and might have beneficial effect on tardive parkinsonism. © 2015, Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences.

AB  - BeagleBone Black is a low-cost, open hardware computer uniquely suited to interact with sensors and actuators directly and over the Web. Introduced in April 2013 by BeagleBoard.org, a community of developers first established in early 2008, BeagleBone Black is used frequently to build vision-enabled robots, home automation systems, artistic lighting systems, and countless other do-it-yourself and professional projects. BeagleBone variants include the original BeagleBone and the newer BeagleBone Black, both hosting a powerful 32-bit, super-scalar ARM Cortex A8 processor capable of running numerous mobile and desktop-capable operating systems, typically variants of Linux including Debian, Android, and Ubuntu. Yet, BeagleBone is small enough to fit in a small mint tin box. The "Bone" may be used in a wide variety of projects from middle school science fair projects to senior design projects to first prototypes of very complex systems. Novice users may access the power of the Bone through the user-friendly BoneScript software, experienced through a Web browser in most major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or the Linux operating systems. Seasoned users may take full advantage of the Bone's power using the underlying Linux-based operating system, a host of feature extension boards (Capes) and a wide variety of Linux community open source libraries. This book provides an introduction to this powerful computer and has been designed for a wide variety of users including the first time novice through the seasoned embedded system design professional. The book contains background theory on system operation coupled with many well-documented, illustrative examples. Examples for novice users are centered on motivational, fun robot projects while advanced projects follow the theme of assistive technology and image-processing applications.

AB  - Due to the high risk of global warming from the increased level of energy consumption, energy sustainability is increasingly practised around the world especially in the residential sector. Attempts to save energy in hot-humid climates however, are mainly through improved mechanical cooling. Consequently, residential buildings are built to be air tight and they are provided with insufficient opening areas for natural ventilation which in turn, results in the deterioration of indoor air quality (IAQ). Previous studies on IAQ with respect to ventilation rates are mostly on indoor concentrations of contaminants and various diseases associated with them. Detailed studies on openings and their impact on delivered ventilation rates are still limited, particularly in hot-humid climates. This study investigates natural ventilation provisions in different house design types in Putrajaya, Malaysia with respect to the Uniform Building By-Law (UBBL) governing them. Five terrace house design types were selected, of which two were found to be non-compliant with UBBL 10% window area requirement. Simulations were conducted using the Integrated Environment Solution (IES〈VE〉) software and the results reveal that house types complying with the UBBL requirements exhibit higher ventilation rates and a longer duration of leaving windows open is found to improve ventilation rates. This paper informs regulatory stakeholders, designers and clients of the residential building sector of the impact of open designs on occupants' health and the importance of UBBL compliance and enforcement. This study further emphasises the need for occupants to increase the duration of leaving windows open and to embrace night ventilation as a means of improving natural ventilation in their homes. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - There are many potential applications in the utilities, critical infrastructure monitoring and control and environmental monitoring. This article charts the device-level technologies used in the creation the IoT, including hardware, software and communications. IoT's emergence coincided with the development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology offering advantages such as the communicable range, ability to write data to a tag, and the possibility of reading multiple tags more efficiently with a single reader. RFID is now just one of many component IoT technologies. We have arrived at a situation where it is practically trivial to integrate computation and communication into any manufactured thing, and it is equally feasible to connect and technologically perceive natural things using communicable sensors. Furthermore, it is possible to react to, and control the environment using embedded computing devices coupled with actuators. Thorough comprehension of functional and non-functional requirements is necessary to develop an effective, efficient design specification for an IoT device. But given the large design space and complexity, there are numerous barriers to entry. As a result, many types of device have been adopted as practical de facto hardware development platforms across research communities, anc hacker and maker communities. In each case, intermediary 'operating systems', designed to simplify their programming by masking hardware complexity, are typically used. Their technical specifications are often not fully disclosed, but they do rely on well- defined standards to ensure the necessary interoperability. The majority of devices are characterised as single board computers. The final design for a market-ready product will likely be as efficient and cost-effective as possible in terms of design, but include sufficient redundancy to support software updates and potential shifts in standards. Since the early 2000s, the wireless sensor network community has worked with highly constrained devices characterised by limited energy, storage, communications, packet loss, etc. Incremental improvement! to hardware components have led to net energy efficiency improvements, increased computation for equivalent or less energy, more storage, etc. Algorithms and protocol! have been developed to further improve efficiency and reliability. The 'maker' movements have focused on open source hardware whereas those on the educationa side have sought to reduce the barriers to entry in terms of cost and simplification, e.g. the Raspberry Pi. Industrialists have increasingly tended to incorporate monitoring systems into their operations. Cellular connectivity has also been adopted and both are now converging on IoT. Although wireless connectivity has been central to the development of many IoT standards, devices with wired connections can also be part of the IoT. Indeed, many standards relevant to IoT are designed independent of the particular physical communications medium enabling seamless interoperability at higher layers and easing connectivity concerns in integrated applications. A number of approaches exist to developing software for IoT devices. As the computing power available increases, the ease with which one may programme the device tends to improve. The fewer resources that are available, the closer the software developer must get to the hardware. To reduce the complexity of programming devices, operating systems and associated programming languages have been designed or adapted to suit the embedded environment. Considering the more computationally powerful single board computers, certain flavours of Linux have been developed. High-end boards with significant processing capabilities are capable of running full-blown operating systems. Recently, mobile operating systems, such as Android, have been used, and stripped down versions have been touted by the big developers. From a devices perspective, it is easier than ever to connect a sensor, a controller, or a mundane household item to the Internet. On the other hand, there are still significant challenges to be overcome. With regard to industrial applications with strict performance requirements, multiple constraints, and often-difficult operational environments, work is far from complete.

AB  - Freestall housing for dairy cows was created to reduce the amount of bedding and labor needed to keep stalls clean. However, some aspects of stall design may restrict stall usage by cows. The aim of this study was to assess dairy cow preference and usage of a conventional stall (with a neck rail and metal stall dividers) and an alternative stall design with no neck rail or stall dividers other than a wooden board protruding slightly (8. cm) above the lying surface. In the no-choice phase of the study, 48 cows were randomly assigned to 8 groups (of 6 cows each); groups were alternately allocated to the 2 treatments. Each group was observed for 7 d on one treatment and then switched to the alternate treatment for 7 d. For the choice phase (also 7 d), groups in adjacent pens were merged (to form 4 groups, each with 12 cows) and cows had free access to both treatments within the merged pen. In the no-choice phase, cows spent more time standing with 4 hooves in the alternative versus conventional freestall (0.60 ± 0.06 vs. 0.05 ± 0.06. h/d), but stall designs had no effect on time spent lying down (13.2 ± 0.4 vs. 12.9 ± 0.4. h/d). In the choice phase, cows spent more time lying down in the conventional freestall (9.4 ± 0.8 vs. 4.1 ± 0.8. h/d) and more time standing with all 4 hooves in the alternative stall (0.24 ± 0.03 vs. 0.02 ± 0.03. h/d). These results illustrate how different stall design features can affect different types of stall use; the more open design facilitated standing fully in the stall, but the protruding partitions likely made the stall less suitable for lying. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - The complexity of modern chips is rapidly increasing. To fulfill tight time-to-market constraints, more and more blocks from previous designs are reused or third party IP blocks are licensed. However, such blocks are often only poorly documented making adjustments to the blocks a difficult task. This paper presents a technique for automatic feature localization for hardware designs. Our approach helps a developer in understanding a design by localizing parts of the code which implement a certain feature of interest. We evaluate the approach on three open source designs. For those designs, our approach yields a more precise localization of the code implementing the different features than the documentation of the design. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: The present trial evaluated incorporation of bright light therapy in the treatment of chronic nonspecific back pain (CNBP). Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open design with three parallel trial arms was used. Setting: Subjects received a novel therapeutic, an expected therapeutic ineffective low dose, or no light exposure at three different medical centers. Patients: A total of 125 CNBP patients reporting pain intensity of ≥3 points on item 5 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were included. Intervention: Over 3 weeks, 36 active treatment, 36 placebo controls, and 33 controls received 3 or no supplementary light exposures of 5.000lx or 230lx, respectively. Outcome Measures: Changes in self-reported scores of pain intensity (BPI sub-score 1) and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire) were the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported overall pain sensation (BPI total score), grade of everyday life impairment (BPI sub-score 2), mood (visual analog scale), and well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index). Results: Changes in pain intensity were higher (1.0 [0.8-1.6]) in the bright light group compared with controls (0.3 [-0.1-0.8]; effect size D=0.46). Changes in the depression score were also higher in the intervention group (1.5 [0.0-2.5]) compared with controls (0.0 [0.0-2.0]; effect size D=0.86). No differences were seen in change scores between intervention vs sham group. Conclusion: The present randomized controlled trial shows that light therapy even in low dose could improve depressive symptoms and reduce pain intensity in CNBP patients. Further research is needed for optimizing parameters of frequency, dose, and duration of therapeutic light exposure. © 2014 American Academy of Pain Medicine 15 12 December 2014 10.1111/pme.12503 Original Research Article GENERAL SECTION Original Research Article Copyright Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - No-till farmers in Australia often use narrow point openers to place seed and fertiliser in furrows in conjunction with the spraying of pre-emergence herbicides. These openers can produce excessive soil throw which creates problems such as increasing the depth of soil cover on adjacent furrows, herbicide contamination above seed in adjacent furrows, increased stimulation of weed seed germination and furrow moisture loss. This study evaluated the effect of a range of bent leg narrow opener geometries on soil movement when operating at 120mm depth and 8.2kmh-1. Results showed that a bent leg opener geometry combined with a chamfered face could loosen a furrow without throwing soil laterally out of the furrow due to the shank being offset (bent) away from the central upheaval of soil. The bent leg openers were also able to loosen soil with minimal mixing of soil layers. Increasing the shank offset from the furrow centre reduced the surface soil interaction with the vertical shank section operating in the furrow. Decreasing the side bend angle from 65° to 45° reduced surface tracer lateral movement. Adding a leading foot to a bent leg opener reduced the loosened cross sectional area by 13% due to the shallower engagement of the side-leg portion. These findings have implications for optimising no-till seeding practises through better control of soil throw, aiming to: reduce weed seed germination and soil moisture loss, enable narrower row spacing options, the safer use of pre-emergence herbicides incorporated when seeding and higher operating speeds. © 2014.

AB  - Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost ―open hardware‖ platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 &lt; 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The rise of network speeds to tens of gigabits per second poses a challenge to develop packet processing applications that can cope with such bit rates. Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardwarebased networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The central neuropathic pain (DNC) is that caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the central nervous system that generates an incapacitating condition, difficult to recognize and treat. The most common causes are stroke (CVA), multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Objectives: To perform a systematic review of the main causes of central neuropathic pain, present evidence of the effectiveness and tolerability of current treatment options and analyze trends analgesic for future. Material and methods: We performed meta-analysis and search for systematic reviews in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) using different search strategies. The DNC related articles were classified by etiopathogenesis poststroke pain (CPSP), pain of multiple sclerosis (MS) and pain after spinal cord injury (SCI), and were evaluated systemically. Results: Currently we have an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this type of pain, there are few studies, in comparison with other types of pain, and these studies mostly with small samples, open design in human or animal models. It requires the use of specific and validated assessment instruments specific to each condition, and to include a multi-modal approach to treatment, combining drug therapies, physical, psychological and cognitive behavioral interventions. Conclusions: We need more studies to understand the pathophysiology of the central neuropathic pain, improve the effectiveness of treatments and identify eligible patients each according to clinical characteristics, symptoms or signs predictive, and to investigate new therapeutic modalities, comparing drug reference assets. At present there is not enough solid evidence to perform standardized protocols for treatment of DNC.

AB  - We describe a flexible, simple to build, low-cost, and computer-controlled optical mirror actuator system, developed for undergraduate research laboratories. Geared motors for hobby robotics are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller in combination with an H bridge to finely position mirror mount actuators. We present a graphical user interface based on the Python script language. The price of the fully controlled actuator system is only a small fraction of the price of a commercial system. It can be quickly implemented due to the use of open-hardware electronics. We discuss the performance of the system and give an outlook for future expansions and use in advanced optical setups. © 2015 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - Objective: Congenital defects/diseases • Unusual or unexpected effect of treatment. Background: The decision of which stent can be used for treating a congenital heart lesion can be difficult for a pediatric interventional cardiologist. Features of an ideal stent would be to have a low profile to enable small sheaths to be fitted and allow for advancement. It would need to be flexible to negotiate curves of arteries and have sufficient radial strength to prevent recoil of the lesion and vessel. It should have high trackability and wide struts to enable junctional artery flow and prevention of thrombosis and toxic adverse effects from the stent. Case Reports: Much work is being carried out to design the ideal stent and provide the best treatment for congenital heart lesions. We investigated this matter with the use of the Valeo stent in 2 patients. The Valeo stent is a new pre-mounted stent with several advantages for use in children with complex cardiac conditions. We investigated the Valeo stent's ability to navigate tortuous cardiac anatomy and maintain junctional artery blood flow. In addition, the stents have sufficient radial strength to provide long-term support to the large pulmonary arteries involved. Conclusions: The new open-design, premounted, stainless steel Valeo stent has been shown to be useful in treating pulmonary artery stenosis and in young children when catheterization is a less popular choice in comparison to balloon angioplasty. In addition to previous use of Valeo stents in coarctation of the aorta, we have shown the benefits of the stent for pulmonary artery stenosis. © Am J Case Rep, 2014.

AB  - Background: Careful observation of the longitudinal course of bipolar disorders is pivotal to finding optimal treatments and improving outcome. A useful tool is the daily prospective Life-Chart Method, developed by the National Institute of Mental Health. However, it remains unclear whether the patient version is as valid as the clinician version.Methods: We compared the patient-rated version of the Lifechart (LC-self) with the Young-Mania-Rating Scale (YMRS), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Clinician version (IDS-C), and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar version (CGI-BP) in 108 bipolar I and II patients who participated in the Naturalistic Follow-up Study (NFS) of the German centres of the Bipolar Collaborative Network (BCN; formerly Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network). For statistical evaluation, levels of severity of mood states on the Lifechart were transformed numerically and comparison with affective scales was performed using chi-square and t tests. For testing correlations Pearsońs coefficient was calculated.Results: Ratings for depression of LC-self and total scores of IDS-C were found to be highly correlated (Pearson coefficient r = -.718; p < .001), whilst the correlation of ratings for mania with YMRS compared to LC-self were slightly less robust (Pearson coefficient r = .491; p = .001). These results were confirmed by good correlations between the CGI-BP IA (mania), IB (depression) and IC (overall mood state) and the LC-self ratings (Pearson coefficient r = .488, r = .721 and r = .65, respectively; all p < .001).Conclusions: The LC-self shows a significant correlation and good concordance with standard cross sectional affective rating scales, suggesting that the LC-self is a valid and time and money saving alternative to the clinician-rated version which should be incorporated in future clinical research in bipolar disorder. Generalizability of the results is limited by the selection of highly motivated patients in specialized bipolar centres and by the open design of the study. © 2014 Born et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Many neuroscience experiments rely on presenting stimuli and measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1. ms (sd=. 0.17. ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2. ms (sd=. 0.54. ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations. © 2014.

AB  - Turbidity is an internationally recognized criterion for assessing drinking water quality, because the colloidal particles in turbid water may harbor pathogens, chemically reduce oxidizing disinfectants, and hinder attempts to disinfect water with ultraviolet radiation. A turbidimeter is an electronic/optical instrument that assesses turbidity by measuring the scattering of light passing through a water sample containing such colloidal particles. Commercial turbidimeters cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of low-resource communities around the world. An affordable open-source turbidimeter based on a single light-to-frequency sensor was designed and constructed, and evaluated against a portable commercial turbidimeter. The final product, which builds on extensive published research, is intended to catalyze further developments in affordable water and sanitation monitoring. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The performance of optical coatings may be negatively affected by the deleterious effects of mechanical stress. In this work, we propose an optimization tool for the design of optical filters taking into account both the optical and mechanical properties of the substrate and of the individual deposited layers. The proposed method has been implemented as a supplemental module in the OpenFilters open source design software. It has been experimentally validated by fabricating multilayer stacks using e-beam evaporation, in combination with their mechanical stress assessment performed as a function of temperature. Two different stress-compensation strategies were evaluated: (a) design of two complementary coatings on either side of the substrate and (b) implementing the mechanical properties of the individual materials in the design of the optical coating on one side only. This approach has been tested by the manufacture of a Fabry-Perot etalon used in astronomy while using evaporated SiO2 and TiO2 films. We found that the substrate curvature can be decreased by 85% and 49% for the first and second strategies, respectively. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study presents a detailed account of processes and multiple methodologies used in conducting a diagnostic post-occupancy evaluation (POE) in an urban hospital emergency department. BACKGROUND: Healthcare design POE research findings can lead to improved work environments for healthcare providers and higher levels of staff, patient, and visitor satisfaction. METHODS: This evaluation was conducted in two separate phases over 12 months, with data analysis occurring after each phase. Phase 1 involved 200 hours of observation, physical measurements, and occupancy counts. Phase 2 included surveys (n = 315) of staff, visitors, and patients. In addition, eight distinct staff focus groups (e.g., Nursing, Housekeeping, Physician, etc.) were conducted. RESULTS: To illustrate the process, one healthcare design-related issue, privacy and confidentiality, was assessed in light of the linear design model with a central core. Phase 1 observation results indicated that most confidential conversations were contained within the linear core. However, Phase 2 focus groups revealed that many staff members had concerns regarding the level of privacy and confidentiality due to the core's open design. The use of multiple methods provided greater information and a more comprehensive picture of the emergency department environment and design. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a comprehensive framework for diagnostic post-occupancy evaluation in healthcare design. The findings indicate that a systematic, multi-methodological approach developed around a conceptual framework can lead to higher quality evaluations. Diagnostic POEs should be grounded in extant literature and customized based on the setting, the client's guiding principles, and the design team's objectives. In diagnostic POEs, one size does not fit all. © 2014 VENDOME GROUP LLC.

AB  - Background: Propofol is often used as an anesthetic agent for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In recent studies, propofol was shown to possess significant seizure-shortening properties during ECT. "Valproate" is a mood stabilizer used mainly in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. It is reported that valproate, being an anticonvulsant, raises the seizure threshold, thus decreases the efficacy of ECT treatment. Aim: The purpose of our study was to compare the dose of propofol in valproate-using patients and valproate-free patients. Methods: In an open design, 17 patients with bipolar affective disorder manic episodes who were to be treated with valproate and ECT in combination, were compared with 16 manic-episode patients who were to be treated with ECT but not valproate. The two groups were compared on the basis of electroencephalography-registered seizure duration and the propofol dosage required to induce anesthesia. Results: Valproate, compared with no valproate treatment, results in a decrease in the propofol dose required to induce anesthesia. In the valproate group of study participants, seizure duration was significantly shorter than in the valproate-free group. Conclusion: The results suggest that valproate reduces the dose of propofol required for anesthesia during ECT treatment in patients with bipolar affective disorder manic episodes. Although propofol is a safe and efficacious anesthetic for ECT treatment, lower doses of propofol should be used to induce anesthesia for patients under valproate treatment. When the clinician needs to prolong seizure duration in patients treated with valproate, interruption of the valproate treatment or an anesthetic agent other than propofol should be considered. © 2014 Hizli Sayar et al.

AB  - The ever-intensifying time-to-market pressure imposes great challenges on the pre-silicon design phase of hardware. Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - NwAvGuy, an anonymous audio engineer, exposed his own skills by presenting an open-source design for a headphone amp that he called the Objective 2 (O2). He did this after strenuously arguing on his blog and other online forums that the only proper way to evaluate audio equipment is to use quantitative blind testing. NwAvGuy boasted that his minimalist amplifier, which can be purchased for as little as $129 proves engineers don't need exotic parts or esoteric circuit designs for best-in-class sound, accuracy, and performance. People started building his amplifiers using the design documents and detailed notes that NwAvGuy provided online. Then various vendors started producing and selling assembled versions of the O2 amplifier. But in July 2012, NwAvGuy went silent and stopped blogging. His mysterious disappearance created a predicament when the power jack used in the O2 amplifier went out of production.

AB  - Using millimeter-wave spectroscopy, we study the electromagnetic response of asymmetric split-ring resonators made from superconducting niobium. The asymmetry is introduced by using different arm lengths of the U-shape split-ring design. A small asymmetry allows the excitation of an otherwise dark mode with only a weak coupling to electromagnetic field. The radiation losses are strongly reduced in this geometry. The combination of weak electromagnetic coupling and reduced ohmic losses in a superconductor leads to high quality factors of split-ring resonators. Quality factors of up to 150 in an open design are achieved experimentally. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

AB  - Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of innovative robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this modern world many communication devices are highly intelligent and interconnected between each other. Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1. This work will be helpful even for first year level of engineering students to easily implement any communication and control applications with cheaper cost. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Open design has become an umbrella term for a wide range of approaches to design and creativity where professional design is challenged. These range from seeing designers as simply irrelevant (in democratized innovation) to an active and creative collaboration between designers and non-designers (co-design) to the dissolution of the distinction between designer and non-designer altogether. While supporting open design in general, we argue that there are important instances where open design approaches may not be appropriate and that there will be a polarization between casual design activity (for cups, T-shirts and so on) and critical designs (medical equipment, very complex systems like mobile phones). © 2014, BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING PLC.

AB  - Purpose: The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings: The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications: The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications: The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications: The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value: The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The developing world remains plagued by lack of access to safe drinking water. Although many low-cost methods have been developed to treat contaminated water, low-cost methods for water-quality testing are necessary to determine if these appropriate technologies are needed, effective, and reliable. This paper provides a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of a low-cost, open-source (OS) water testing platform. A case study is presented where the platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than current commercially available tools. It is concluded that OS hardware development is a promising solution for the equipment necessary to perform water quality measurements in both developed and developing regions. © IWA Publishing 2014.

AB  - Open design is a catchall term for various on- and offline design and making activities. It can be used to describe a type of design process that allows for (is open to) the participation of anybody (novice or professional) in the collaborative development of something. As well as this, it can mean the distribution and unrestricted use of design blueprints and documentation for the use by others. In this paper, the authors highlight various aspects of open and collaborative design and argue for the use of new terms that address what is open and when. A range of design projects and online platforms that have open attributes are then explored, whereby these terms are applied. In terms of design, the focus is specifically on the design of physical things rather than graphical, software or system design. © 2014, BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING PLC.

AB  - The German Federal Office for Radiation Protection operates a network of about 1800 gamma dose rate stations as a part of the national emergency preparedness plan. Each of the six network centres is capable of operating the network alone. Most of the used hardware and software have been developed in-house under open-source license. Short development cycles and close cooperation between developers and users ensure robustness, transparency and fast maintenance procedures, thus avoiding unnecessary complex solutions. This also reduces the overall costs of the network operation. An easy-to-expand web interface has been developed to make the complete system available to other interested network operators in order to increase cooperation between different countries. The interface is also regularly in use for education during scholarships of trainees supported, e.g. by the 'International Atomic Energy Agency' to operate a local area dose rate monitoring test network. © The Author 2014.

AB  - The Internet of Things, otherwise known as IoT, IPv6 or Industr y 4.0 is going to become wider, linking 25 billion smart devices and intelligent systems in operation around the world. Ethernet-based networks, such as EtherCAT, allow every part of an automation system, from sensors to robots, to exchange information at high speeds. This gives the controller instant access to every detail of production information. Once this controller is also connected to the enterprise-level Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). End-user IT departments will have to work more closely with engineering to allow shop-floor equipment to have direct access to enterprise-level systems without the use of middleware. The latest controllers, such as Omron's Sysmac NJ series, combine the reliability and rugged design of a traditional PLC, but use an open hardware architecture combined with software ?engines' within a single CPU, rather than multiple CPUs, to manage their different functions. Ricoh plans to use similar instant communication with an enterprise-level database to scan codes on used toner cartridges sent to its Telford site for recycling. In this case, an NJ controller will allow data, including the number of previous refills, to be checked. This will in turn enable the system to determine whether any given cartridge should be refilled again, while also updating the database. The FAG SmartCheck from Schaeffler FAG recognises and reports the first vibrations of a system long before any noise is generated. That means there is substantially longer time to react before the machine fails.

AB  - In teaching undergraduate automatic controls, the laboratory experience is an important and irreplaceable component. Historically, good platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes. Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing laboratory procedures for students to study controls. The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-touse hardware and software. The "motor shield" is an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller design. The Arduino board is powered by, and communicates with Simulink, through a standard USB connection.

AB  - Two prominent social progressive movements are faced with a few contradictions and a paradox. On the one side, we have a re-emergence of the co-operative movement and worker-owned enterprises which suffer from certain structural weaknesses. On the other, we have an emergent field of open and Commons-oriented peer production initiatives which create common pools of knowledge for the whole of humanity, but are dominated by start-ups and large multinational enterprises using the same Commons. Thus we have a paradox: the more communist the sharing license used in the peer production of free software or open hardware, the more capitalist the practice. To tackle this paradox and the aforementioned contradictions, we tentatively suggest a new convergence that would combine both Commons-oriented open peer production models with common ownership and governance models, such as those of the co-operatives and the solidarity economic models.

AB  - This paper presents an open embedded hardware and software architecture for industrial robot control applied to visual servoing system. This architecture is a hardware and software co-design where embedded processors drive the FPGA for motor control. It is robot type independent, as long as the motors are equipped with incremental position encoders and driven by PWM signals. Low cost, low power consumption, high stability, flexibility and expandability are the key advantages. The architecture and related IP cores are developed through a component-based design model which interprets a mechatronic system by computation, communication, configuration and coordination components, together with composition of these components and blackboxes. The motor controller IP core is provided in the consistency of open hardware. Open software implies the use of OROCOS (Bruyninckx, 2001). The performance of visual servoing behaviour is evaluated by visual coupling of a Performer MK2 robot and a KUKA lightweight robot. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In the process of seam tracking based on arc sensor of pipeline welding, the accuracy of deviation signal feature extraction can be enhanced and the preferable welding quality can be obtained by the high-frequency oscillation arc. Aiming at the accuracy and real-time control of the high-frequency torch, the new frequency oscillation scheme of welding torch was designed and the CAN bus control network based on CAN-open protocol was constructed. According to the principle of CAN-open equipment model, the LabVIEW control program was compiled and the PDO mapping of transfer variables was completed through the access of the object dictionary by SDO to configuration the communicate parameters of digital servo drive. The test results show that the system run stably, data transmission was reliable and met the control requirements of high frequency oscillation torch. ©, 2014, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

AB  - Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 ± 0.4 μL/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - This paper introduces metrics derived from application of a Markov decision process to evaluate a design's changeability. Changeability is known to improve product performance if conscientious early-stage design decisions are matched with structured management of the system in response to exogenous disturbances - shifts which may be environmental, market, technological, and political in nature. Included in the paper is a brief discussion of changeability's role in ensuring strategic product performance as well as a review of past metrics developed, highlighting the open design challenge to more fully capture the managerial and process dimensions inherent to changeability. The proposed metrics are featured in a case study related to the ballast water system of an ocean-going vessel. The result of such application is greater context for the value changeability offers and an improved understanding of the resources required to manage uncertainty over the product's life cycle. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - For security and privacy considerations, it is important for Android users to understand the behavior and the risk of an application. Although Google claims that new applications available on the official market have passed their security checks, the open design of the Android system still allows a user to install applications for thirdparty vendors. Therefore, there is still a demand for users to know more about an unknown application. In this paper, we discussed our experiences on setting up a scalable automated Android behavior monitor using virtualization techniques. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) We design and implement a scalable behavior monitor using both dynamic analysis and static analysis techniques; and (2) Based on parts of the analyzed results, we develop a preliminary filter to distinguish benign and malicious applications. The system is open to the public and we expect that the analyzed results can be fed back to the research community and further stimulate more studies on analyzing malicious Android applications.

AB  - Four studies examined the relationship between mindfulness and interoception (measured via cardiac perception). Studies 1 and 2 compared participants undergoing week long practice (15 m daily) of an audiotaped body-scan, relative to a sound-scan and no-intervention control condition (n = 20 per group). No significant differences in change in cardiac perception accuracy, confidence in cardiac accuracy judgements or the correlation between them (coherence) were found between conditions. Study 3 used an open design to examine the effects of a more intensive meditation training (completing an 8-week MBSR or MBCT course; n = 19). Cardiac perception accuracy and coherence did not improve, but participants became significantly more confident. Study 4 examined the relationship between cardiac perception and trait mindfulness (n = 165). Trait mindfulness did not relate to cardiac perception accuracy, but more mindful individuals were more confident. Mindful observation was associated with reduced, whereas other components of mindfulness predicted superior, coherence. These findings suggest that mindfulness practice does not simply work by improving cardiac perception accuracy but does increase confidence. However, it remains possible that mindfulness increases perceptual accuracy of other bodily systems, which needs to be explored using a wider array of experimental measures (e.g. respiratory awareness) in future research. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The fundamental principles of quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS) are discussed, concentrating on instruments used in vacuum applications. The mass-selective element is the quadrupole mass filter, first described in a 1956 patent. Although originally intended for isotope separation, the concept soon became applied to analytical chemistry and to residual gas analysis (RGA), also known as partial pressure analysis (PPA). The ion optical design of a typical general-purpose quadrupole RGA has altered little since the 1970s - although of course there have been major advances in electronics packaging, data capture, and automation. There is growing interest in miniaturised systems for high-pressure work. These instruments mostly use electron-impact ionization sources, based on principles established nearly 100 years ago. Those used for vacuum applications are generally of two types: an "open" design, rather like a miniature Bayerd-Alpert gauge, and a "closed" design, generally based on Nier's work. The simplest and most robust detector is a Faraday collector; alternatively an electron multiplier is used when the highest sensitivity is required. Often the quadrupole drive electronics and the amplifier are mounted directly on the vacuum flange, giving a compact assembly. Instrument control and data acquisition is almost always done via a computer interface. This gives a very versatile and powerful system. Nevertheless, to obtain the maximum benefit from any mass spectrometer it is often necessary to keep in mind the underlying physical principles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy often experience a loss of quality of life. Moreover chemotherapy may induce neutropenia. Patients report a better quality of life when additionally treated with mistletoe products during chemotherapy. Methods. In this prospective randomized open-label pilot study 95 patients were randomized into three groups. All patients were treated with an adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study was quality of life, the secondary objective was neutropenia. Here we report the comparison of HxA (n = 34) versus untreated control (n = 31). Results. In the explorative analysis ten of 15 scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 showed a better quality of life in the HxA group compared to the control group (P < 0.001 to P = 0.038 in Dunnett-T3 test). The difference was clinically relevant (difference of at least 5 points, range 5.4-12.2) in eight of the ten scores. Neutropenia occurred in 7/34 HxA patients and in 8/31 control patients (P = 0.628). Conclusions. This pilot study showed an improvement of quality of life by treating breast cancer patients with HxA additionally to CAF. Although the open design may be a limitation, the findings show the feasibility of a confirmatory study using the methods described here. © 2014 Wilfried Tröger et al.

AB  - Introduction: To compare early and long-term outcomes of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open repair (OPEN). Design: Prospective observational, per protocol, non-randomized, with retrospective analyses. Material and methods: Between 2000 and 2005, a total of 311 patients having EVAR or OPEN repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms were identified and included in this prospective single-center observational study. A propensity score-based optimal-matching algorithm was employed, and 138 patients undergoing EVAR procedures were matched (1:1) to OPEN repair. Results: Open repair showed higher hospital mortality (17% vs. 6%, p = 0.004), respiratory failure (p &lt; 0.026), transfusion requirement (p &lt; 0.001), and intensive care unit admission (27% vs. 7%, p &lt; 0.001), and longer hospitalization (p &lt; 0.001). Median follow-up was 70 months (25th to 75th percentile, 24 to 101). Actuarial survival estimates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 93%, 74%, 49% for the OPEN group compared to 89%, 69%, 59% for the EVAR group (p = 0.465). A significant difference between groups was observed in younger patients (&lt; 75 years) only (p &lt; 0.044). Late complication and re-intervention rates were significantly higher in EVAR patients (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Freedom from late complications at 1, 5 and 10 years was 96%, 92%, 86%, and 84%, 70%, 64% for OPEN and EVAR procedures, respectively. Conclusions: Our experience confirms the excellent results of the EVAR procedures, offering excellent early and long-term results in terms of safety and reduction of mortality. Patients &lt; 75 years seem to benefit from EVAR not only in the immediate postoperative period but even in a long-term perspective. Copyright © 2014 Termedia &amp; Banach.

AB  - Background. The study on stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for epilepsy (SANTE) is so far the only clinical trial to provide class I evidence for the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in partial epilepsy. Stratification of possible responders and potential contraindications are still lacking. Aim. The rationale and the design of a double-blind and an open interventional study protocol for the nucleus accumbens (NAC) as a potential target for DBS in epilepsy are introduced in this article. Material and methods. In both investigation protocols potential psychiatric alterations were collated using the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) as well as cognitive alterations using an extensive epilepsy-specific neurocognitive examination. Additionally the Liverpool seizure severity scale (LSSS) was used to objectify possible alterations in the severity of seizures. Determination of the quality of life was carried out using the quality of life inventory for epilepsy P-31. The patients completed a seizure calendar in which a differentiation was made and documented between simple focal, complex focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The anti-ictal medication for all patients treated with DBS was left unaltered during the investigation period. The minimum requirement for admission to the 6-month interventional study investigation protocol was a seizure frequency of at least one debilitating seizure per month. The randomized controlled investigation protocol had a shorter observation period of only 3 months and required a minimum of three debilitating seizures per month. Results. For the four patients who have so far been recruited into the interventional study protocol there was a tendency towards a reduction of the subjective severity of seizures after 6 months of NAC-DBS (p∈=∈0.068). Seizure frequency as well as psychiatric and neurocognitive outcome parameters remained unchanged. Conclusion. These preliminary results suggest that the NAC might represent a suitable target for DBS in partial epilepsy in syndrome-oriented indications for focal epilepsy; however, the small patient numbers and the open design of this protocol warrant higher evidence class studies to confirm the results and identify possible responders and side effects. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this paper we explore the role of subjective well-being within the process of making together a personalized assistive device. Through a process of social product adaptation, assistive artifacts become part of occupational therapy and co-evolve with clients. Personal digital fabrication tools enable small user groups to make and share their one-of-a-kind products with the world. This approach opens up new possibilities for disabled people and their caregivers to actively engage with their own skills and challenges. The paper describes a case study of an inclusive participatory design approach, which leads to qualitative occupational experiences within the feld of community-based practice. The aim is to show how the process of collaborative designing, making and using artifacts fosters several elements of subject well-being in itself. The starting point of this open design process is a threefold interaction involving industrial designers, patients and occupational therapists within their local product ecology. Co-experience driven design is an inter subjective process that enables all individual stakeholders to work on a common phenomenon in respect of each subjective experience. Participatory prototyping is applied as a mobilization medium that (a) coordinates and (b) motivates design actions towards collaborative well-being equilibriums. This form of artifact-mediated participatory design embodies simultaneously (1) a communication language between all stakeholders that identifies meaningful goals, (2) an explorative process to attain and challenge these goals, (3) a selection of meaningful and engaging prototyping activities and (4) an appropriateness process with local skills and technology. By implementing this creative process, disabled people and their carers become conscious actors in providing collaborative maintenance of their own physical, mental and social well-being. © 2013 De Couvreur, Dejonghe, Detand and Goossens.

AB  - With the recent development of the RepRap, an open-source self-replicating rapid prototyper, low-cost three-dimensional (3D) printing is now a technically viable form of distributed manufacturing of polymer-based products. However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PLA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - CERN's accelerator control group has embraced ''Open Hardware'' (OH) to facilitate peer review, avoid vendor lock-in and make support tasks scalable. A web-based tool for easing collaborative work was set up and the CERN OH Licence was created. New ADC, TDC, fine delay and carrier cards based on VITA and PCI-SIG standards were designed and drivers for Linux were written. Often industry was paid for developments, while quality and documentation was controlled by CERN. An innovative timing network was also developed with the OH paradigm. Industry now sells and supports these designs that find their way into new fields.© CERN 2013.

AB  - Since its inception in 19th-century Germany, the physiology laboratory has been a complex and expensive research enterprise involving experts in various fields of science and engineering. Physiology research has been critically dependent on cutting-edge technological support of mechanical, electrical, optical, and more recently computer engineers. Evolution of modern experimental equipment is constrained by lack of direct communication between the physiological community and industry producing this equipment. Fortunately, recent advances in open source technologies, including three-dimensional printing, open source hardware and software, present an exciting opportunity to bring the design and development of research instrumentation to the end user, i.e., life scientists. Here we provide an overview on how to develop customized, cost-effective experimental equipment for physiology laboratories. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Liquid levels are measured in a variety of agricultural applications, and are often measured manually, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Rapid advances in electronic technologies have made a variety of inexpensive sensing, monitoring, and control capabilities available. A monitoring system was developed and evaluated for automatic measurement of liquid levels, and demonstrated by monitoring water levels in evaporation pans used in evaporation studies and irrigation scheduling. The system is composed of an ultrasonic sensor, a microcontroller-based data logger, and a temperature sensor. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the sensor to the liquid surface. Air temperature is measured by the temperature sensor, and is used to compensate for changes in the speed of sound due to air-temperature variations to improve accuracy of ultrasonic distance measurements. The datalogger is programmed to take measurements and to store data on a memory card which can be downloaded for processing and analysis. All components of the system were assembled in a PVC housing. The system was tested in the field, and resulted in water levels measured by the system corresponding very closely to those measured manually (R2 &gt; 0.98). This system is inexpensive, with total cost of US$85, and easy to build, install, and maintain. In addition to monitoring liquid levels, the system could be adapted to a variety of other measurements.

AB  - Open source design is a new mode which is composed of many agents who spontaneously cooperate to complete product design. A process model of open source design based on multi-agent is proposed in this paper with the purpose of studying the dynamic characteristics of product evolution and the ability of design-agent in the process of product design. A set of indexes which can evaluate the process of product evolution and the ability of agent is developed, including the weight of each module, product maturity, completion time of module for each agent and development ability of the agent. The algorithms of indexes are realized and verified in the simulation program. The simulation results show that the proposed simulation approach and evaluation indexes are effective for evaluation and management of open source design. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to resolve three major issues in location-based applications (LBA) known as heterogeneity, user privacy, and context-awareness by proposing an elastic and open design platform named OpenLS privacy-aware middleware (OPM) for LBA. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes relevant approaches ranging from both academia and mobile industry community and insists the importance of heterogeneity, user privacy, and context-awareness towards the development of LBA. Findings: The paper proposes the OPM by design. As a result, the OPM consists of two main component named application middleware and location middleware, which are cooperatively functioned to achieve the above goals. In addition, the paper has given the implementation of the OPM as well as its experiments. It is noted that two privacy-preserving techniques at two different levels are integrated into the OPM, including Memorizing algorithm at the application level and Bob-tree at the database level. Last but not least, the paper shows further discussion about other problems and improvements that might be needed for the OPM. Research limitations/implications: Each issue has its sub problems that cause more influences to the OPM. Besides, each of the issues requires more investigations in depth in order to have better solutions in detail. Therefore, more overall experiments should be conducted to assure the OPM's scalability and effectiveness. Practical implications: The paper hopefully promotes and speeds up the development of LBA when providing the OPM with suitable application programming interfaces and conforming the OpenLS standard. Originality/value: This paper shows its originality towards location-based service (LBS) providers to develop their applications and proposes the OPM as a unified solution dealing with heterogeneity, user privacy, and context-awareness in the world of LBS. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper describes the use of the open source hardware platform, denominated "Arduino", for controlling solenoid valves for solutions handling in flow analysis systems. System assessment was carried out by spectrophotometric determination of iron (II) in natural water. The sampling rate was estimated as 45 determinations per hour and the coefficient of variation was lower than 3%. Per determination, 208 μg of 1-10-phenanthroline and ascorbic acid were consumed, generating 1.3 mL of waste. "Arduino" proved a reliable microcontroller with low cost and simple interfacing, allowing USB communication for solenoid device switching in flow systems.

AB  - An outstanding issue in graph-theoretical studies of brain functional connectivity is the lack of formal criteria for choosing parcellation granularity and correlation threshold. Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays. © 2013 IPEM.

AB  - In the United States, peripheral artery disease (PAD) is on the rise due to an epidemic increase in metabolic diseases like diabetes, aging population, and tobacco use. Until recently, accepted management strategies for treatment of symptomatic lower extremity PAD were limited to balloon angioplasty and self-expanding nitinol stents (either open design or covered). The goal for endovascular PAD intervention is to maintain and improve the mobility of the patient. With ambulation there are specific movements to the superficial femoral artery and it is subjected to various and continuous stresses to include compression, torsion and bending which can ultimately result in stent fracture or in-stent restenosis for endovascular therapy. Treatment with atherectomy for symptoms of lower extremity disease has now been shown to be effective in re-establishing blood flow with minimal vessel trauma and may serve as an alternative to a stent-first approach. Additionally, the presence of plaque with modest to severe calcification remains common and a debulking approach initially with further adjunctive therapy remains appealing.

Instructions are a common example of communicating models of technological systems and can act as a boundary object between designers' conceptual models and models developed by users. Understanding the models people have of how systems work can be important in public engagement with science, health, democracy, and environmental issues. One engagement domain less explored so far from an HCI perspective is the growing open design or Maker movement. Developing conceptual models for new technology, designers should support how people want to think about doing their tasks, and user-generated instructions for existing tasks could provide a starting point here. Equally, with an exercise based around a system actually being redesigned, it would be possible to analyze instructions created by users by clustering similar models to enable the segmentation of design options.

AB  - This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. This book is intended for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To meet this wide audience, the book has been divided into sections to satisfy the need of each reader. The book contains many software and hardware examples to assist the reader in developing a wide variety of systems. The book covers two different Arduino products: the Arduino UNO R3 equipped with the Atmel ATmega328 and the Arduino Mega 2560 equipped with the Atmel ATmega2560. The third edition has been updated with the latest on these two processing boards, changes to the Arduino Development Environment and multiple extended examples. © 2013 by Morgan & Claypool.

AB  - The rapid detection and identification of infectious disease pathogens is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (μBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The μBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the μBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The μBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the μBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The μBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the μBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics. © 2013 Myers et al.

AB  - Here, a simple micro free-flow electrophoresis (μFFE) was developed for fluorescence sensing of monosaccharide via supermolecule interaction of synthesized boronic acid functionalized benzyl viologen (ο-BBV) and fluorescent dye. The μFFE contained two open electrode cavities and an ion-exchange membrane was sandwiched between two polymethylmethacrylate plates. The experiments demonstrated the following merits of developed μFFE: (i) up to 90.5% of voltage efficiency due to high conductivity of ion-exchange membrane; (ii) a strong ability against influence of bubble produced in two electrodes due to open design of electrode cavities; and (iii) reusable and washable separation chamber (45 mm × 17 mm × 100 μm, 77 μL) avoiding the discard of μFFE due to blockage of solute precipitation in chamber. Remarkably, the μFFE was first designed for the sensing of monosaccharide via the supermolecule interaction of synthesized ο-BBV, fluorescent dye, and monosaccharide. Under the optimized conditions, the minimum concentration of monosaccharide that could be detected was 1 × 10-11 M. Finally, the developed device was used for the detection of 0.3 mM glucose spiked in human urine. All of the results demonstrated the feasibility of monosaccharide detection via the μFFE. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - We describe a microscopy design methodology and details of microscopes built to this 'open' design approach. These demonstrate the first implementation of time-domain fluorescence microscopy in a flexible automated platform with the ability to ease the transition of this and other advanced microscopy techniques from development to use in routine biology applications. This approach allows easy expansion and modification of the platform capabilities, as it moves away from the use of a commercial, monolithic, microscope body to small, commercial off-the-shelf and custom made modular components. Drawings and diagrams of our microscopes have been made available under an open license for noncommercial use at http://users.ox.ac.uk/~atdgroup. Several automated high-content fluorescence microscope implementations have been constructed with this design framework and optimized for specific applications with multiwell plates and tissue microarrays. In particular, three platforms incorporate time-domain FLIM via time-correlated single photon counting in an automated fashion. We also present data from experiments performed on these platforms highlighting their automated wide-field and laser scanning capabilities designed for high-content microscopy. Devices using these designs also form radiation-beam 'end-stations' at Oxford and Surrey Universities, showing the versatility and extendibility of this approach. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - In this paper, a bistatic passive radar receiver system named "Coherent-scatter Atmospheric Passive Radar Imager (CAPRI)" is described. It is primarily designed to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere by utilizing "transmitters of opportunity" as the RF target illuminators. CAPRI is constructed using the open source software-defined radio toolkit, GNU Radio, to meet the signal processing requirements in combination with the open source hardware, Universal Software Radio Peripheral 2, for data acquisition. The resultant system is highly flexible, and we present the details of the design as well as a performance analysis. CAPRI will be deployed in Peru, near the magnetic equator, for long-term operations in the area. FM stations near Lima, Peru, will be utilized with the targets of interest being the equatorial electrojet and the spread F. The results will then be compared to the Jicamarca Unattended Long-term investigations of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere (JULIA) radar data, and CAPRI will be used to improve the simultaneous time and spatial coverage in the region in a more cost-effective manner.

AB  - Early industrialism was influenced by the organization of cottage industries, and in a similar vein, many of today's creative industries emerge largely from networked small-scale initiatives or cultural scenes. Collaborations and interactions are the backbone of the contemporary Do-It-Yourself (DIY) or 'maker culture', a distributed milieu of open software programmers and hardware hackers, but also crafters, backyard tinkerers, hobbyists and homesteaders. The scene is held together by micro-management tactics, or 'molecular' management, using protocols to guide collaborative innovation and shared craft practices, forming an emergent and innovative creative cottage industry. The maker culture is thus less of a DIY and more a do-it-together culture, merging collaborative play and interactions, often for the sake of shared curiosity. The mindset of the participants is that of the explorative craftsman; using a practical attitude of sharing ideas, methods and skills among practitioners, and the interactions are managed in a flat and meshworked manner through the use of protocols. The text specifically examines the protocols of the maker movement, finding an immediate connection between hardware protocols, like the 'makers bill of rights' guiding the principles of open source hardware, and the principles reflected in the social protocols of two hacker spaces. The maker culture is not only a loose network of dispersed tinkerers, it is also a close-knit molecular assemblage of materials, tools, skills and makers. © 2012 Intellect Ltd Editorial.

AB  - The preliminary design for the Open Prototype for Educational NanoSats (OPEN) demonstration spacecraft, OpenOrbiter, is presented. OPEN is designed to facilitate the formation of CubeSat development programs nationally and worldwide via providing a publically-available set of spacecraft design documents, implementation and testing plans. These documents should allow the creation of a 1-U CubeSat with a parts budget of approximately $ 5,000. This allows spacecraft development to be incorporated in regular curriculum and supported from teaching (as opposed to research) funds. The OPEN design, implemented by OpenOrbiter, has an innovative internal structure, separates payload and operations processing and includes features to ease and highlight errors in integration. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives. Due to concerns about the safety of stimulants for ADHD, novel assessments of the cardiopulmonary impact of these agents are needed. Methods. An open design of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) in 15 adults with DSM-IV ADHD. Following a psychiatric evaluation and medical history, subjects underwent echocardiography (TTE) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). LDX was titrated to 70 mg daily over 6 weeks, followed by monthly visits to 6 months. Change in TTE and CPET measures were examined following up to 6 months of LDX. Results. At endpoint, there were no significant alterations in indices of cardiac systolic performance, or in metabolic and ventilatory variables at maximum exertion (P values >0.05). We found significant mean changes in resting LV systolic dimension and Doppler diastolic indices. Change in heart rate recovery at 1 min met statistical significance (P = 0.05). Conclusions. We did not detect clinically meaningful changes in cardiac structure and function or in metabolic and ventilatory variables at maximum exertion in ADHD adults receiving open LDX. The clinical significance of changes in resting LV dimension and indices of diastolic function are not in the direction of cardiomyopathy. Future large sample controlled study can examine these findings, as well as stimulants' impact on heart rate recovery. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.

AB  - A woman having already undergone maxillectomy came to the department complaining of difficulty in eating and speech. During the construction of an obturator, the bulb area should be hollowed to reduce weight so that the teeth and supporting tissues are not stressed unnecessarily. The conventional open design drains fluid from the adjacent mucosa, possibly increasing the weight of the prosthesis, and is difficult to clean. The closed bulb design does not drain secretions and may cause obstruction and susceptibility to infection in the paranasal and pharyngeal regions, though it is easier to maintain. An alternative to the two designs, combining their advantages, is presented in this report. As the open hollow part of the obturator was shallow, it was easy to clean. Making the inferior part of the bulb hollow and closed led to a reduction in the overall weight of the prosthesis while increasing its resonance. Copyright 2013 BMJ Publishing Group.

AB  - The high cost of what have historically been sophisticated research-related sensors and tools has limited their adoption to a relatively small group of well-funded researchers. This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures. High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it. Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural analysis, etc. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most people, the rise of open-source hardware is poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods. © 2013 Zhang et al.

AB  - Although aquaculture in the Mediterranean is a relatively young industry, finfish diseases have been reported to cause considerable problems and mortalities among the farmed stocks. In general, the farming activity and the open design of Mediterranean aquaculture systems allow the transmission of infectious pathogens within and among farm facilities. Fish health and biosecurity programmes at farms have focused on the most obvious pathways for transmission of pathogens, i.e. through transport of infected farmed fish from hatcheries, infected equipment, staff and vessels, as well as through water currents. However, little attention has been devoted to the potential risk of pathogen and disease transmission in Mediterranean open-sea aquaculture through movements of fish. The present study focuses on the importance of considering possible pathogen transmission between reared fish, farmed escapees and farm-aggregated fish when making management decisions. © Inter-Research 2013.

AB  - The U.S. air traffic control system is reliant on legacy systems that artificially limit air traffic capacity. With the demand for air transportation increasing each year, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) upgrade to modernize the air traffic control system. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a key component of the NextGen upgrade, enables an aircraft to generate and broadcast digital messages that contain the GPS coordinates of aircraft. The incorporation of ADS-B is intended to provide enhanced accuracy and efficiency of surveillance as well as aircraft safety. The open design of the system, however, introduces some security concerns. This paper evaluates the limitations of the legacy systems currently used in air traffic control and explores the feasibility of employing format-preserving encryption, specifically the FFX algorithm, in the ADS-B environment. The ability of the algorithm to confuse and diffuse predictable message input is examined using message entropy as a metric. Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided that highlight areas which should be examined for inclusion in the ADS-B upgrade plan. © 2013.

AB  - Background: Dermoscopy has been widely implemented to diagnose various skin and scalp disorders. However, existing devices that call for direct scalp contact may alter the appearance of hair features or perifollicular structures. Objective: This paper will show how the Canfield DermScope® can quickly and easily identify various nonscarring and scarring scalp disorders. Its open design does not change the direction of affected hairs or blanch certain features such as erythema. Features like perifollicular hyperkeratosis and loss of follicular orifices are still easily visible. Methods and Materials: The author prospectively photographed patients with hair and scalp disorders in private practice between 2011 to 2012 using the handheld Canfield DermScope device. Results: The presence of scale, erythema, tufting, miniaturized or broken hairs, and loss of follicular orifices were quickly identified to make a diagnosis. Conclusion: The diagnosis of hair and scalp disorders can be greatly facilitated by the use of the DermScope device.

AB  - OpenPMU is an open platform for the development of phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology. A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility. A new modularized architecture for the OpenPMU is presented using an open messaging format which the authors propose is adopted as a platform for PMU research. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Building a radiosonde with open hardware solutions engages engineering students in meteorological problems and allows them to develop new ideas about probing the atmosphere. The students have realized that the importance of the radiosonde as a tool for gathering meteorological data is enormous. The radiosonde allows measurement and transmission of data from regions mostly inaccessible to humans in a short period of time. Key advantages of the radiosonde over other observing systems are its relatively low cost, high accuracy, and high vertical resolution in situ vertical profiles of the atmosphere from the surface up to tens of kilometers. The existing radiosondes have evolved into a relatively standard and well-developed set of instruments that measure temperature, pressure, and humidity.

AB  - The Cutting Circle is an international research initiative by fashion designers/patternmakers and educators Timo Rissanen, Julian Roberts and Holly McQuillan. By exploring alternative methods of making clothes and patterns, we have employed 'risky' design practice, research and teaching to develop zero waste fashion and subtraction cutting. The project manifested as an intensive two-week practice-based research event, where via a series of collaborative collisions, experiments and design intersections, we asked the following three questions. What costs/benefits can we identify to aid the development of a sustainable fashion industry through risk taking at the intersection of our design practices? What new knowledge arises in risky collaborative design practice? And how can this new knowledge be best communicated to foster an environment of risk-taking within the traditionally risk adverse fashion industry? This paper primarily discusses our responses to the first two questions and related issues raised. It covers how experimenting with each other's design practice and practicing in each other's creative space as we both designed and made, enable the free transfer of ideas and cross-pollination, thus expanding our ability to identify links, gaps and opportunities. The Cutting Circle project has developed experimental practices with emphasis on the fusion of aesthetics, patternmaking, craft and socially invigorating design. © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study discusses emerging design activities in the fashion industry and their implications for motivating sustainable consumption. The paper provides an insight into the broad opportunities of fashion activism for designers. As the basis for discussion and evaluation of the research questions, the author has compared the applicability of the bespoken strategies with selected findings from her own empirical case study. The case study entails two participatory clothing design workshops with 'half-way' products. The main research question elaborates on whether fashion activism can be considered as a tool for designers to help consumers defeat their desire to constantly consume more. This involves three sub-questions. First, how effective is fashion activism as a tool in raising awareness for sustainability issues in the fashion industry? Secondly, do participatory design processes and enabling solutions help the consumer gain new skills and develop a greater appreciation towards his/her products? This implies that the user can become his/her own designer and maker, and thereby possibly change his/her own behaviour and attitude through a deeper understanding of the production process. Therefore, and thirdly, can fashion activism ease the transition towards sustainable consumption? The final discussion will focus on the evidence gathered by the comparison of fashion activism strategies and the author's own research. The empirical case study has offered insight into the objectives of fashion activism specifically through half-way products. The findings positively confirm the expected advantages of half-way products. The half-way garments seem to ease the first step for user involvement. In addition, the research highlights the importance that consumers understand products and production. This understanding is a key factor for sustainable fashion consumption. © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Optimization under uncertainty (OUU) is a powerful methodology used in design and optimization to produce robust, reliable designs. Such an optimization methodology, employed when the input quantities of interest are uncertain, yields output uncertainties that help the designer choose appropriate values for input parameters to produce safe designs. Apart from providing basic statistical information, such as mean and standard deviation in the output quantities, uncertainty-based optimization produces auxiliary information, such as local and global sensitivities. The designer may thus decide the input parameter(s) to which the output quantity of interest is most sensitive, and thereby design better experiments based on just the most sensitive input parameter(s). Another critical output of such a methodology is the solution to the inverse problem, i.e., finding the allowable uncertainty (range) in the input parameter(s), given an acceptable uncertainty (range) in the output quantities of interest. We apply optimization under uncertainty to the problem of heat transfer in fin heat sinks with uncertainties in geometry and operating conditions. The analysis methodology is implemented using DAKOTA, an open-source design and analysis kit. A response surface is first generated which captures the dependence of the quantity of interest on inputs. This response surface is then used to perform both deterministic and probabilistic optimization of the heat sink, and the results of the two approaches are compared. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - A case study of hobbyists developing a desktop 3D printer, indicative of a broader movement around open hardware development, is used to advance a theoretical apparatus drawing on social movement research. This is proposed as an alternative to how innovation by users is typically studied in innovation studies literature, namely, as discrete, isolated cases. Open hardware development projects make up a larger ecology, held together by common ideas, a shared communication infrastructure, conferences and licenses, among other things, and it therefore makes sense to look at them as part of a single movement. © 2013, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

AB  - The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The open hardware mobile manipulator (OHMM) is a new open platform with a unique combination of features for teaching robotics software and algorithms. On-board low-and high-level processors support real-time embedded programming and motor control, as well as higher-level coding with contemporary libraries. Full hardware designs and software source codes are available under free licenses enabling the community to adapt and update the design as the field (and available hardware) evolves. Digital manufacturing (3-D printing and laser cutting) methods, now available as low-cost Internet services, enable OHMM to be easily modified and to be built from scratch for a competitive price. Five hands-on curriculum modules are presented that use OHMM to teach robotics software and algorithms at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and results are presented based on student performance and feedback. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a single-degree-of- freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a "motorized fader." A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive nished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a 2000 open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work necessary for the mass distribution of this technology. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In the middle of the twentieth century, banks changed from 'closed' designs signifying wealth, security, and safety to 'open' designs signifying hospitality, honesty, and transparency as the perception of money changed from a passive physical substance to be slowly accumulated to an active notational substance to be kept in motion. If money is saved, customers must trust that the bank is secure and their money will be there when they want it; if money is invested, customers must trust that it is being done openly and honestly and they are being well-advised. Architecture visually communicates that the institution can be trusted in the requisite way. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The White Rabbit (WR) project is a multi-laboratory, multi-company effort to bring the best of the data transfer and the timing world together in a completely open design. WR is a fully deterministic Ethernet-based network for general purpose data transfer and synchronization. The aim is to enable the synchronization of a large number of nodes with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond jitter over long lengths of fibre. The key technologies used are physical layer syntonization (clock recovery) and the Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588). WR generates sub-nanosecond synchronous precision timing in all nodes by continuous tracking and compensating the transmission delays. We give an overview of the WR project and describe the design goals and specifications of the project. The WR switch and the (user) node which are the central components of the WR system and real timing measurements of prototypes of WR hardware are presented. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need exists for robust and efficient optimal design methods for application to multibody systems, in which the components to be designed represent connections between large displacement, large rotation motions of the subsystems' bodies. One specific application is occupant restraint systems, such as the Gunner Restraint System (GRS), in which both the vehicle and the gunner can undergo large relative and absolute motions under extreme driving or external threat conditions. In addition, the restraint/connection components can have amplitude-dependent, time-dependent, and timing-dependent behaviour, such as an active belt retractor. Current optimisation methodologies are ill suited for this problem, suffering from infeasibility, lack of robustness, and/or high computational expense. This paper presents an extension of topology optimisation techniques to consider multibody dynamics systems and to treat a much more open design space, which can include passive, active, and reactive structures/devices. The objective is to obtain an optimally combined structural and material system, considering the best use of passive, active and reactive members. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND:: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by severe debilitating chronic pain. Patients with CRPS may experience various pain sensations, which likely embody different pathophysiologic mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the differential effects of central γ-aminobutyric acid (B) receptor stimulation on the different pain qualities in CRPS patients with dystonia. METHODS:: The 10 pain qualities of the neuropathic pain scale, dystonia severity, and changes in use of antinociceptive drugs were evaluated every 3 months for a period of 1 year in 42 CRPS patients with dystonia receiving titrated doses of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) treatment in an open design. RESULTS:: Using a linear mixed model analysis and controlling for global dystonia severity and the use of supplemental analgesics, we found a significant improvement in global intense pain, sharp pain, dull pain, and deep pain during the first 6 months. After this period, the scores leveled off despite further improvement of dystonia and continued ITB dose escalation. CONCLUSIONS:: γ-Aminobutyric acid (B) receptor stimulation by ITB exerts differential antinociceptive effects on specific pain qualities in CRPS patients with dystonia.

AB  - The virtual design of machining centers is a modern and well-known computer aided technique. Several modeling and simulation architectures, based on the lumped mass approach and on finite element method, are now well established and widely exploited worldwide. These solutions rapidly allow the basic setup of the kinematics of the feed drives and make possible a dynamic optimized dimensioning of all the main subsystems and structures of the machining center. This paper deals with research efforts aimed at developing an innovative and open design platform which allows the integration, in a user friendly framework, of the main procedures cited above with other design tools and facilities. An operator interface procedure and a package of input-output graphic routines, managed through a multilevel data base, are now active in this framework and interact with lumped mass and finite elements modules. According to these considerations the proposed tool allows to quickly and easily analyze alternative design solutions and makes possible to optimize the dynamic performances of the machine tool, helping the designer in the definition of the optimum machine tool characteristics before the manufacturing of the physical prototype. In order to demonstrate the potential of the proposed platform an example concerning the mass optimization of the Y axis of a gantry machining center is presented.

AB  - Background: Goshajinkigan (GJG) is used for the treatment of several neurological symptoms. We investigated the efficacy of GJG and mecobalamin (B12) against neurotoxicity associated with docetaxel (DOC) in breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Sixty breast cancer patients were treated with DOC. Thirty-three patients (GJG group) received oral administration of 7.5 g/day GJG and 27 patients (B12 group) received oral administration of 1500 μg/day B12. Neuropathy was evaluated according to DEB-NTC (Neurotoxicity Criteria of Debiopharm), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC) ver. 3.0, and a visual analogue scale (VAS). This study employed a randomized open design. Results: The incidence of neuropathy was 39.3% in the GJG group, and 88.9% in the B12 group (p<0.01). In the GJG group, grade 1 DEB-NTC was observed in 2 cases, grade 2 in 5 cases and grade 3 in 5 cases. Grade 1 NCI-CTC was observed in 7 cases, grade 2 in 6 cases, and VAS was 2.7±2.2. In the B12 group, grades 1, 2 and 3 DEB-NTC were observed in one case, 12 cases and 12 cases, respectively; and grades 1, 2 and 3 NCI-CTC were observed in 11 cases, 12 cases and one case, and VAS was 4.9±2.4. Conclusions: Concomitant administration of GJG is useful in preventing neuropathy in breast cancer patients treated with a DOC regimen.

AB  - The open source design movement is extending from the field of software development to general product development, which makes it possible that general users participate in the entire process of engineering design, but there is still lack of systematic theories to effectively support this collaborative design behavior. This paper proposes system optimization design model of the user domain and engineering domain on the basis of existing research works, defines various types of attribute parameter variables and optimization functions, and on this basis, and solve collaborative optimization. The econometric model, which takes the customer's maximum effectiveness as target, has already been applied to the field of engineering design, the project takes correlation analysis on design domain, engineering domain, user domain and manufacturing domain to establish a unified analysis and decision-making model, which not only meets the local optimum within field, but also considers the best goal of whole enterprise that in which time slot can have maximum profits, so this makes the decision-making process of product development and design becomes more scientific.

AB  - Background: We have previously shown that a standardized acupuncture augmentation was effective for antidepressant partial responders with major depressive disorder (MDD). This pilot study examines the efficacy and safety of this protocol as monotherapy for MDD. Methods: Thirty outpatients (73% female, mean age 47 ± 12 yrs) with SCID-diagnosed MDD were recruited and received 8 weeks of standardized 30-minute open acupuncture treatment using 5 specific body points on the arms and legs bilaterally, with manual stimulation every 10 min, and concurrent electroacupuncture (2 Hz current) at two points along the midline of the head. Subjects were assigned to once-weekly (n = 21) or twice-weekly (n = 9) treatment, depending on preference. Change in Hamilton-D-17 score was the primary outcome measure, and positive response to treatment (defined as ≥ 50% improvement in HAM-D-17 scores compared to baseline) was the secondary outcome measure. Results: HAM-D-17 scores decreased from 19.1 ± 4.4 to 9.9 ± 6.3 (p < 0.001) in the once-weekly acupuncture group, and from 21.9 ± 5.3 to 14.3 ± 6.1 (p = 0.012) in the twice-weekly acupuncture group. Improvement did not differ significantly between treatment arms. Response rates were 62% for the once-weekly acupuncture group and 22% for the twice-weekly acupuncture group (NS). Twenty patients (14 in weekly treatment group and 6 in twice-weekly treatment group) completed the study. The most common side effects included mild soreness/pain (n = 13), and mild bleeding (n = 16) at the needle site. Limitations: Open design and small sample. Conclusions: Standardized acupuncture treatment was safe, well-tolerated and effective, suggesting good feasibility in outpatient settings. Replication in controlled trials is warranted. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Idleness has to be carefully exploited in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to save power and to accumulate the energy possibly harvested from the environment. State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness. This paper presents VirtualSense, an open-hardware open-source ultra-low-power reactive wireless sensor module featuring a Java-compatible VM. © 2012 Emanuele Lattanzi and Alessandro Bogliolo.

AB  - In a short period of time, open design went from an unknown notion to a buzzword in the Dutch design world. This development is usually attributed to the proliferation of bottom-up activities fostered by a typically open Dutch society. However, although open design is commonly associated with grassroots, bottom-up activities, in the Netherlands, the most visible effort at widespread dissemination of these ideals has been the result of a highly centralized effort largely supported by government funding. Why were the government and cultural organizations interested in fostering open design practices? And what type of open practices has this top-down model engendered? Advancing from a constructivist approach, we examine how this discourse has been formed by the convergence of actors with distinct agendas, and position it in relation to its cultural and economic contexts. © BERG 2012.

AB  - Open design is a new design paradigm that creates a lot of dilemmas for designers to deal with. However, these dilemmas are mostly being discussed from within the design sector itself and from very polarized perspectives which do not provide much depth to create ways to deal with this new paradigm. This paper considers open design as a philosophical position that relates to broader cultural developments and puts the way we deal with design in the perspective from our attitude to identity which can be described as a performance. To create a new thinking space to reconsider openness, the non-representational thought model of the rhizome is applied to examples from Dutch design culture which will offer a more thorough understanding of where the true innovative power of open design lies. © BERG 2012.

AB  - This project seeks to demonstrate the use of remote experimentation and 3D virtual environments applied to the teaching-learning in the areas of exact sciences-physics. In proposing the combination of remote experimentation and 3D virtual worlds in teaching-learning process, we intend to achieve greater geographic coverage, contributing to the construction of new methodologies of teaching support, speed of access and foremost motivation for students to continue in scientific study of the technology areas. The proposed architecture is based on a model implemented fully featured open source and open hardware. The virtual world was built in OpenSim software and integrated it a remote physics experiment called "electrical panel". Accessing the virtual world the user has total control of the experiment within the 3D virtual world.

AB  - Open design has emerged as a topic generated by a new logic of thinking: the internet with its rhizomatic creative networks and open software. Over the last decades the network has become a new conceptual technology by which to think and describe the world in a new way, and collaborative networks have also become the main actors in the new economy, generating questions of what 'open' actually means. As a new generation of knowledge and design workers set out to engage with networked and post-Fordist labour they also generate new forms of conflict. The power over standards and protocols guides the use of the creative platforms, both enabling collaborative and co-creative design as well as shaping it according to the aims of those setting the standard. Similarly, on an organizational and political scale it seems open design may 'bite back' in an increasingly conflicting form of 'immaterial labour', fragmenting any organized resistance and making every creative act freely exploitable under the irresistible slogan of 'open'. Today, we may be seeing a new class of precarious and 'free' creative work being produced by a 'cognitarian' or 'hacker' class, revealing the creative industries as the low-wage sweatshops they are. Open design may make us feel free, yet that does not mean we are not controlled. It may be obvious, but open does not only mean free or shared, but also exposed, unsettled and contested. © BERG 2012.

AB  - This paper looks into the way the consumer moves along the paradigm shift of design from being objects of status identity, towards open design, with a focus on the making rather than the having. In 2005 the magazine Wallpaper* advertised a lamp designed by Massimo Vignelli (1955), with the slogan: I don't care what it is for, I want it. This message represents very much the generic meaning in the 2000s, of design being about status and artistic form, rather than about function and practical use. Based on a 2009 study of the way inhabitants in one street in full gentrification in Flanders, think of, buy into and actively participate within the design field, this paper shows how the Flemish public has very much been influenced by the narratives of lifestyle media and design producers. However, in the way they deal with design at home, it becomes obvious that the majority of respondents do not much buy into mediated design objects, nor do they want to be associated with the non-functional status symbol these products often represent. However, almost all participants have actively been refurbishing their home within the aesthetics of a much promoted design-style, which leads to the conclusion that not only the designer himself, but also the consumer, is recently looking for another meaning of design. Making seems to be more important than having, which coincides with the growing interest in open design. © BERG 2012.

AB  - Objective: Chronic opioid therapy may be associated with hyperalgesia. Our objective was to determine if opioid-induced hyperalgesia detection sensitivity is dependent on the stimulus used to detect it. Methods: This open design study compared the detection of hyperalgesia in opioid-dependent subjects (n = 16) and healthy control subjects (n = 16) using the following pain stimuli: cold pain, electrical stimulation, mechanical pressure, and ischemic pain. The opioid-dependent subjects were maintained on either methadone (n = 8) or buprenorphine (n = 8) for at least 3 months. None of the controls was dependent on opioids or other drugs of abuse. Results: The opioid-dependent subjects were markedly more sensitive than controls to the cold pain test. Compared with the control group, the hazard ratio for ceasing the test due to intolerable pain was 7.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-23.3) in the buprenorphine group and 4.5 (95% CI 1.7-15.6) in the methadone group, with similar data for the cold pain threshold. Of the remaining tests, there were differences only for the electrical pain threshold between treatment groups, with the geometric mean threshold in the buprenorphine group being 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-1.9)-fold higher (ie, less sensitive) than that of the controls; the geometric mean for the methadone group was 1.3 (95% CI 1.04-1.7)-fold higher than that of the controls. There were no significant differences between buprenorphine and methadone patients in test responses. Women were more sensitive to the cold pain (hazard ratio for tolerance, 3.1 [95% CI 1.4-7.3]) and ischemic tests (hazard ratio for tolerance, 2.7 [95% CI 1.2-6.1]). There were significant correlations between cold and ischemic tolerances (r = 0.50; P = 0.003) and between electrical and mechanical pain tolerances (r = 0.52; P = 0.002). Conclusion: These findings indicate that cold pain is the most suitable of the methods tested to detect opioid-induced hyperalgesia. This is consistent with its sensitivity to detect opioid analgesia. © 2012 Krishnan et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Sufficient bone decompression of osteophytes is important for positive functional outcomes in anterior cervical spine surgery. Achieving good alignment and bone fusion in anterior cervical decompression and fusion requires a bone graft bed of the optimum size and shape. We have developed a stainless steel instrument named the anterior fusion spinal fork, which is designed to aid in accurately drilling the bone cavity, thus enabling selection of the correct size of bone graft or bone graft substitutes. The device has an open design with 4 prongs, and resembles a three-dimensional fork. This instrument assists in guiding the direction of drilling, and marking the drilling point of the graft cavity with pyoctanin markers. We have used this instrument in 40 cases of anterior cervical spine surgery using the modified Smith-Robinson procedure since March 2000. This simple instrument allowed us to design and construct a bone graft cavity of the correct size and shape for iliac bone graft or bone graft substitutes for anterior cervical spine surgery.

AB  - Background: This pilot open noncontrolled study was designed to assess the efficacy of intra-articular injections of a solution combining hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) in the treatment of outpatients affected by knee osteoarthrosis. Findings: Thirty patients with knee OA have been included. The primary objective was to assess clinical efficacy as measured by pain and Lequesne's index. Secondary objectives were to assess potential effect of the treatment on ultrasound parameters, safety and biomarkers of cartilage metabolism and joint inflammation. After a selection visit (V1), the study treatment was administered 3 times on a weekly basis (V2, V3, V4). Follow-up was planned 6 (V5) and 12 weeks (V6) after the first intra-articular injection. Efficacy results showed a reduction in mean pain at V3 and V6 and in functional impairment, the most marked changes being measured at the two follow-up visits (V5 and V6). Although statistical significance was not achieved due to small sample size, a clear tendency towards improvement was detectable for ultrasound assessments as well as biomarkers. Except for a mild injection site hematoma for which the drug causal relationship could not be excluded, no adverse effect of clinical relevance was recorded during the study. Conclusion: Although this pilot study was performed according to an open design only, the ultrasound as well as biomarkers changes strongly suggest a non-placebo effect. These preliminary results call now for a randomized controlled study to confirm the clinical relevance of the observed results. © 2012 Henrotin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - System design is of great importance for intelligent vehicle which is aimed at driving in diverse senarios under specific hardware and software configuration. The entry of Beijing Institute of Technology in the 2011 Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge (11'FC) - BIT-III is presented. The open design of BIT-III's autonomous driving system reflects in two aspects. Safety and stability in driving are guaranteed even when driving in unknown and complex environment by embedding them in the deliberately designed local motion planner. Environmental sensing components are virtualized and fused according to their output mode, which realizes the modularization of the system and considerably simplifies the extension of system functions. The performance of BIT-III in the 11'FC implied that the system is able to drive autonomously in simplified urban environments and is ready to extend functions for more complicated scenarios. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - Bottle filling machines manufacturers mostly concentrate on making their equipments compliant with high hygiene standards in the food and beverage industry. KHS (photo) has created a new platform (or technical base) upon which various computer-controlled KHS filling systems can be founded. The Innofill Glass platform lays the emphasis on transparency and cleanliness. Perrier's bottling machines use a patented neck handling system which guarantees automatic handling and filling height adjustment. The filling carrousel is based upon an open design that makes it easy to clean. Serac has just developed a new aseptic packaging machine for nutritional care dairy products. It is fully compliant with the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) requirements.

AB  - Openers, or brief activities that initiate a class, routinely take up classroom time each day yet little is known about how to design these activities so they contribute to student learning. This study uses technology-enhanced learning environments to explore new opportunities to transform Openers from potentially busy work to knowledge generating activities. This study compares the impact of teacher-designed Openers, Opener designs based on recent research emphasizing knowledge integration, and no Opener for an 8th grade technology-enhanced inquiry science investigation. Results suggest that students who participate in a researcher-designed Opener are more likely to revisit and refine their work, and to make significant learning gains, than students who do not participate in an Opener. Students make the greatest gains when they revisit key evidence in the technology-enhanced curriculum unit prior to revision. Engaging students in processes that promote knowledge integration during the Opener motivate students to revise their ideas. The results suggest design principles for Openers in technology-enhanced instruction. © IEJEE.

AB  - Objective: To quantify owner concerns regarding clinical signs in canine patients receiving chemotherapy and to assess degree of concordance between client and veterinarian concerns regarding patient quality of life. Methods: Retrospective analysis of owner-reported concerns during chemotherapy treatment. Ownerreported adverse events were recorded sequentially for each patient through a partially open design questionnaire and correlated with veterinary patient summaries for each visit. Canine patients treated for transitional cell carcinoma, haemangiosarcoma, malignant melanoma or osteosarcoma were eligible for inclusion. Minimum treatment eligibility was two chemotherapy treatments given in 21-day protocol cycles, with a maximum of six treatment cycles recorded. Results: A total of 553 evaluable visits, seen by 18 oncology clinicians, were assessed. Owners expressed concern before chemotherapy in 48% of visits. Owner concerns at the first visit did not differ significantly from those expressed at the sixth visit. Remission status was a significant factor in owners' rate of reporting concerns. Diarrhoea grade was associated with owners' concerns. Clinician gender was not associated with responsiveness to owners' concerns. Clinical Significance: Questionnaire-based surveys appear to be an effective tool for communicating dog owners' concerns regarding chemotherapy and potentially for monitoring a clinician's attentiveness. Owners expressed concerns at approximately half of chemotherapy appointments. © 2012 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.

AB  - The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - In this paper the design and manufacturing processes for coreless axial flux permanent magnet generators are described for low cost rural electrification applications, where local production of small wind turbines is considered. The process is based on already existing open source design and construction manuals, while a systematic approach to designing generators of varying nominal power and for grid connection or direct battery charging schemes is described. The manufacturing process of a 3 kW small wind turbine generator for grid connection is used as a case study. Emphasis is given to the use of simple tools and techniques to achieve a lower cost, while intricate steps in the manufacturing process are described in more detail. The generator design is simulated and the constructed machine is tested in the laboratory.

AB  - We explore whether public data networks called SocialMesh - formed automatically from smartphone radio-routers and adapting to changing RF propagation and interference without relying on managed cellular infrastructure -can also be designed to overcome any and all countermeasures mounted by an attacker and reliably support social applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google. We rigorously examine the architecture, techniques and algorithms that make decentralized or "ad-hoc," ultrawideband networks work in the presence of hostile jamming or protocol attacks. We illustrate the RF link-budget using 3-d graphs to show how interference affects the network performance as these networks become heavily utilized or jammed. Using low-cost hardware, self-organizing routing software, and uncoordinated/distributed CDMA we show how they can retain adequate system capacity even under heavy load from users or interference from jammers. Open standardization and field trials of SocialMesh networks will further clarify SocialMesh security and performance by opening up the design specifications to international review. Open-source design specifications for SocialMesh will be updated at http://www.socialmesh.org. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. This book is intended for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To meet this wide audience, the book has been divided into sections to satisfy the need of each reader. The book contains many software and hardware examples to assist the reader in developing a wide variety of systems. For the examples, the Arduino UNO R3 and the Atmel ATmega328 is employed as the target processor. The second edition has been updated with the latest on the Arduino UNO R3 processor, changes to the Arduino Development Environment and several extended examples.

AB  - Much of the widespread poverty, environmental desecration, and waste of human life seen around the globe could be prevented by known (to humanity as a whole) technologies, many of which are simply not available to those that need it. This lack of access to critical information for sustainable development is directly responsible for a morally and ethically unacceptable level of human suffering and death. A solution to this general problem is the concept of open source appropriate technology or OSAT, which refers to technologies that provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same fashion as free and open source software. OSAT is made up of technologies that are easily and economically utilized from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs and must meet the boundary conditions set by environmental, cultural, economic, and educational resource constraints of the local community. This paper explores both the open source and appropriate technology aspects of OSAT to create a paradigm, in which anyone can both learn how to make and use needed technologies free of intellectual property concerns. At the same time, anyone can also add to the collective open source knowledge ecosystem or knowledge commons by contributing ideas, designs, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It is argued that if OSAT continues to grow and takes hold globally creating a vibrant virtual community to share technology plans and experiences, a new technological revolution built on a dispersed network of innovators working together to create a just sustainable world is possible. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) printing has the potential to transform science and technology by creating bespoke, low-cost appliances that previously required dedicated facilities to make. An attractive, but unexplored, application is to use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Urban spaces are pervaded by interpretive and reactive technologies that shape and are shaped by its inhabitants, with an increasingly active role for citizen technologists. Yet the role of domestic spaces in shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city, despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user innovation literatures to present the methodology for the "Homesense" research project that explored how users design and develop "smart" technologies within their own homes, based on the intersection of their concurrent urban/domestic lived experience. Kits of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located "lead users" provided technical expertise. This methodology demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and "lived" expertise in developing these interventions. © 2012 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology.

AB  - The real-time monitoring of events in an industrial plant is an advanced technique that presents the real conditions of operation of the machinery responsible for the manufacturing process. A predictive maintenance program includes various rotating machinery condition monitoring techniques of the machine to determine the conditions of failure. To increase the operational reliability and to reduce preventive maintenance, it is necessary an efficient tool for analysis and process monitoring, in real time, enabling the detection of incipient faults for rolling bearings. Over the past few years there has been a major technological developments related to digital system, including innovations in both hardware and software. These innovations enable the development of new design methodologies that take into account the ease of future modifications, upgrades and expansions of the designed system. This paper presents a study of new design tools for embedded digital systems based on open hardware architecture with reconfigurable logic. Will be discussed a case study in the area of fault detection of rolling bearings, as well as its implementation and testing. © 2012, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - We describe an open-source freeware programme for high throughput analysis of nanoSIMS (nanometre-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry) data. The programme implements basic data processing and analytical functions, including display and drift-corrected accumulation of scanned planes, interactive and semi-automated definition of regions of interest (ROIs), and export of the ROIs' elemental and isotopic composition in graphical and text-based formats. Additionally, the programme offers new functions that were custom-designed to address the needs of environmental microbiologists. Specifically, it allows manual and automated classification of ROIs based on the information that is derived either from the nanoSIMS dataset itself (e.g. from labelling achieved by halogen in situ hybridization) or is provided externally (e.g. as a fluorescence in situ hybridization image). Moreover, by implementing post-processing routines coupled to built-in statistical tools, the programme allows rapid synthesis and comparative analysis of results from many different datasets. After validation of the programme, we illustrate how these new processing and analytical functions increase flexibility, efficiency and depth of the nanoSIMS data analysis. Through its custom-made and open-source design, the programme provides an efficient, reliable and easily expandable tool that can help a growing community of environmental microbiologists and researchers from other disciplines process and analyse their nanoSIMS data. © 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background and purpose: Deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus (GPi-DBS) is established as an effective treatment of primary generalised dystonia in controlled studies. In cervical dystonia (CD), only one previous study has reported observer-blinded outcome assessment of long-term GPi-DBS, with 1-year follow-up. Methods: In this prospective, single-centre study, eight patients with CD (7 women:1 man, 4 focal:4 segmental) treated with bilateral GPi-DBS for median (range) 30 (12-48) months, were evaluated by the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS; Severity, Disability and Pain scores), the Short-Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36), and the Becks Depression Index in an open design. In addition, a blinded rater assessed the TWSTRS Severity score from videos obtained preoperatively and at the last follow-up. Results: In the blinded evaluation, median (range) TWSTRS Severity score improved from 25 (19-30) to 8 (4-23) (P=0.028), thus a 70% (23-82) score reduction. In the open evaluation, median Severity score improvement at the last follow-up was 73%, representing a significant further improvement from 50% at 6months. The Disability and Pain scores improved by median 91% and 92%, respectively, and the SF-36 subdomain scores improved significantly. A reversible right hemiparesis and aphasia occured in one patient 4days postoperatively, because of reversible oedema around the left electrode. No other serious adverse effects and no permanent morbidity were observed. Conclusions: This single-blinded study shows good long-term efficacy of GPi-DBS in CD patients and supports using this treatment in those who have insufficient response to medical treatment. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - CERN makes extensive use of the WorldFIP fieldbus interface in the LHC and other accelerators in the pre-injectors chain. Following the decision of the provider of the components to stop the developments in this field and foreseeing the potential problems in the subsequent support, CERN decided to purchase the design information of these components and in-source the future developments using this technology. The first in-house design concerns a replacement for the MicroFIP chip whose last version was manufactured in an IC feature size found to be more vulnerable to radiation of high energy particles than the previous versions. nanoFIP is a CERN design based on a Flash FPGA implementing a subset of the functionality allowed by the communication standard, fitting the requirements of the different users and including the robustness against radiation as a design constraint. The development presented involved several groups at CERN working together in the framework of the Open Hardware Repository collaboration, and aiming at maximizing the interoperability and reliability of the final product. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.

AB  - The cement production line of the Latvian Broceni Cement Works for which the order was awarded in 2006 was equipped by Loesche both for raw meal production and also for the grinding of clinker using vertical roller mills. The grinding plant was designed for a daily throughput of 3 500 t of clinker; that is an annual production of 1.1 million tonnes of clinker or 1.6 million tonnes of cement. The grinding plant for raw meal production went into operation in May 2009 and that for clinker in September 2009. In contrast to the otherwise standard layout of grinding plants in central Europe the mills in the Broceni Cement Works were erected with an open design, that is, without a closed grinding plant building. In spite of the severe Latvian winter, this design has proven functional without any limitation on availability.

AB  - Here, we present the proof-of-concept for a subsurface bioelectrochemical system (BES)-based biosensor capable of monitoring microbial respiration that occurs through exocellular electron transfer. This system includes our open-source design of a three-channel microcontroller-unit (MCU)-based potentiostat that is capable of chronoamperometry, which laboratory tests showed to be accurate within 0.95 ± 0.58% (95% Confidence Limit) of a commercial potentiostat. The potentiostat design is freely available online: http://angenent.bee.cornell.edu/potentiostat.html. This robust and field-ready potentiostat, which can withstand temperatures of -30°C, can be manufactured at relatively low cost ($600), thus, allowing for en-masse deployment at field sites. The MCU-based potentiostat was integrated with electrodes and a solar panel-based power system, and deployed as a biosensor to monitor microbial respiration in drained thaw lake basins outside Barrow, AK. At three different depths, the working electrode of a microbial three-electrode system (M3C) was maintained at potentials corresponding to the microbial reduction of iron(III) compounds and humic acids. Thereby, the working electrode mimics these compounds and is used by certain microbes as an electron acceptor. The sensors revealed daily cycles in microbial respiration. In the medium- and deep-depth electrodes the onset of these cycles followed a considerable increase in overall activity that corresponded to those soils reaching temperatures conducive to microbial activity as the summer thaw progressed. The BES biosensor is a valuable tool for studying microbial activity in situ in remote environments, and the cost-efficient design of the potentiostat allows for wide-scale use in remote areas. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An experimental study on combined steel-to-timber joints with nails and bolts is conducted in this study. Principal results are as follows: The initial stiffness and effective allowable resistance of combined joints depend obviously on clearances in predrilled bolt-holes. The combined joints with nails and bolts have high potential of energy capacity to resist strong earthquake forces. There are upper limits of clearances in predrilled bolt-holes that allow advantages of considering the synthetic resistance of combined joints in practical structural design. Combining the joint components with appropriate design will give higher performance against strong earthquakes increasing the safety margin and energy capacity until the failure. The combined joints should be designed under the restrictions of particular specifications in closed design systems because the advantages of combining the joint components are influenced obviously by various actual conditions, which are too difficult to consider in detail in open design systems. © 2011 The Japan Wood Research Society.

AB  - The rise of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology as a driver of rural electrification in the developing world and a contributor to climate change mitigation suggests that innovations enhancing PV efficiency and scalability could make considerable strides in reducing both poverty and greenhouse gas emissions. The nearly global access to the solar resource coupled to innovation-driven decreases in the costs of PV provides a path for a renewable energy source to accelerate sustainable development. Open-source software development has proven to produce reliable and innovative computer code at lower costs than proprietary software through sharing development responsibility with a large community of invested individuals. Concepts of open-source design have been applied to other fields in an attempt to reap the same benefits realized within software development; however, applying open-source strategies to solar PV research is uncommon. This paper reviews and examines how open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry. The results show how successful open design and development methods can be created and utilized by identifying business models that provide PV researchers, turnkey suppliers and solar PV module manufacturers with the opportunity to utilize open-source design principles to accelerate innovation. © 2012 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Measuring the height of the vertical jump is an indicator of the strength and power of the lower body. The technological tools available to measure the vertical jump are black boxes and are not open to third-party verification or adaptation. We propose the creation of a measurement system called Chronojump-Boscosystem, consisting of open hardware and free software. Methods: A microcontroller was created and validated using a square wave generator and an oscilloscope. Two types of contact platforms were developed using different materials. These platforms were validated by the minimum pressure required for activation at different points by a strain gauge, together with the on/off time of our platforms in respect of the Ergojump-Boscosystem platform by a sample of 8 subjects performing submaximal jumps with one foot on each platform. Agile methodologies were used to develop and validate the software. Results: All the tools fall under the free software / open hardware guidelines and are, in that sense, free. The microcontroller margin of error is 0.1%. The validity of the fiberglass platform is 0.95 (ICC). The management software contains nearly 113.000 lines of code and is available in 7 languages.

AB  - The integration of the appropriate pedagogic methods for incorporating technologybased disciplines can be challenging within the design curriculum. However designers and design students who also possess the appropriate technological skills are being viewed by an ever increasing number of commercial organisations as valuable company assets. This paper discusses how the design team within NTU is using this platform to enhance the technological experience and knowledge of undergraduate, postgraduate and research degree students. A number of case studies demonstrate how such a relatively inexpensive and simple programming platform is being successfully utilised for a wide variety of design and research applications.

AB  - "Atoms are the new bits". That is the latest buzz arising from the Californian trade press. What do we get when this dictum is sampled with the old rallying cry: "Information wants to be free"? We suggest that the predominant, bounded critique of intellectual property is thereby destabilised. Constitutive of that critique was the exceptionality attributed to infor-mation goods (bits) vis-a-vis tangible goods (atoms). It was thus intellectual property could be presented as something altogether different from private property. We recognise that this way of framing the issue has had tactical advantages, but contend that it has stood in the way of a deeper understanding of what intellectual property is. When the critique of proprie-tary software is expanded by an emerging movement for open hardware development, however, the boundary between intellectual property and property as such crumbles. This enables us to renew our critique of the political economy of infor-mation.

AB  - When first introduced in the late 1970s, pattern language was described by its author, Christopher Alexander, as "a way to take design out of architects' hands". The main purpose of pattern language was to extract the design solution out of people's real "life patterns" and then have both people and professional designers use these solutions. Pattern language had been developed and adopted by number of theorists, architects and urban designer, as well as software designers throughout the last 30 years to create what is called "generative patterns", an end product that depends on sharing design knowledge and responsibilities between users and designers, a practice that may be considered as an "open source" process. The term open source describes a practice in the field of production and development that promotes the availability of end products to users for reviewing and enhancement. This approach has been widely adopted in the field of software design, yet not fully interpreted in architecture and urban design fields. This paper discusses patterns theory contributions to the field of user participation in urban design practices, and steps to be made to develop an open source model for urban design using pattern theory. © Common Ground, Moshira Karmouse, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The aim of the work presented in this paper is to investigate and demonstrate the potential for sensitive, physical and spatial interaction, bringing together the electronic and physical environments in an ecological approach. Through the research and design processes in the author's studio such electronic ecologies as spatial audiovisual environments are developed, in which the audience co-creates the final result through their body movements. An open design approach is applied, the audience participates in the development process at any stage. The paper presents a media framework to place interactivity and time-based material in a context. Several recent pieces are described, interactive video environments such as Trainflow and Facets, including a presentation of technical factors. The paper has a section on mapping and other design considerations, and audience feedback and experiences. The final section of this paper concludes with a discussion and reflection on the process and outcomes, and it presents future directions. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - During the design process of cylinder heads, evaluation of thermo-mechanical fatigue plays an essential role. The IABG thermal cylinder head test rig presents an innovative method for assessing and optimizing cylinder heads with respect to their service strength against thermo mechanical fatigue at a very early stage in the development process. The test rig makes it possible to reduce the testing time and costs significantly in comparison with standard test methods, thus shortening the development time for new cylinder head designs. The test rig's novel, open design also makes it possible to detect crack initiation and investigate the propagation of cracks in the pent roof during thermo shock cycles for the very first time. Inspection procedures do not require the disassembly of the entire engine for fueled operation. The present article exemplifies this new test concept concerning thermomechanical fatigue on cylinder heads including the results of an experimental comparison of two constructive identical cylinder heads with different aluminum cast alloys. © Carl Hanser Verlag, München.

AB  - Social and psychological stressors are both a part of daily life and are increasingly recognized as contributors to individual susceptibility to develop diseases and metabolic disorders. The present study investigated how snacks differing in sensory properties and presentation can influence ratings of affect in consumers with different levels of dispositional anxiety. This study examines the relationships between a pre-disposition to anxiety and food using a repeated exposures design with three interspersed test days over a period of two weeks. The study was conducted on ninety free-living male (n = 28) and female (n = 62) Dutch participants aged between 18 and 35 years old, with a BMI between 18 and 25 kg/m2 and different anxiety trait levels assessed using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory tests. The study was randomized by age, gender, anxiety trait score, and followed a parallel open design. Three test products: dark chocolate, a milk chocolate snack and crackers with cheese spread (control), which differed in composition, sensory properties and presentation, were evaluated. Changes in self-reported anxiety, emotion, and energetic states were assessed as a function of eating the snacks just after consumption and up to one hour. The repeated exposure design over a period of two weeks enabled the investigations of potential cumulative effects of regular consumption of the food products. The milk chocolate snack resulted in the decrease of anxiety in high anxiety trait subjects, whereas dark chocolate and cheese and crackers respectively improved the anxiety level and the energetic state of low anxiety trait participants. The mood effects were not altered with repeated exposure, and the magnitude of changes was similar on each test day, which illustrates the repeatability of the effects of the food on subjective measures of postprandial wellness. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents the development and testing of an open and flexible embedded system applied to positioning and telecontrol (OFESAPO) for outdoor applications. The system is composed of a control center (CC) and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - This gesture recognizer, developed by students in a third-year microprocessor-based laboratory course, takes Wii remote (Wiimote) as an input device to estimate the movements of the user and to compare the detected trajectory with the previously learnt movements, in order to carry out the associated actions. Such a cheap state-of-the-art wireless user interface is very attractive for the students and can be used in many interactive applications, from robotics to virtual reality and multimedia presentations. By combining commercially-available hardware, pattern-matching techniques and programming skills, we are able to foster students' interest on developing innovative potentiallymarketable systems. This freeware project, implemented as a configurable publicly-available library, can be adapted to the needs of any course or student. In our laboratory this open-source DLL is used for remotely controlling a robot (based on an open-hardware Arduino platform), using a PC and the Wiimote, although the DLL can be integrated in any C, C++, Java or C# project. A GUI application (based on a Model-View-Presenter paradigm) is also provided and can be used as a template for new applications or just for debugging purposes. Although the developed application only uses data from the accelerometers, data from the infrared camera and buttons of the Wiimote is also available.

AB  - Background: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is approved in Europe for use in patients with acute ischaemic stroke who meet strictly defined criteria. IST-3 sought to improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke, and to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit.Design: International, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial of intravenous rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke. Suitable patients had to be assessed and able to start treatment within 6 hours of developing symptoms, and brain imaging must have excluded intracranial haemorrhage and stroke mimics.Results: The initial pilot phase was double blind and then, on 01/08/2003, changed to an open design. Recruitment began on 05/05/2000 and closed on 31/07/2011, by which time 3035 patients had been included, only 61 (2%) of whom met the criteria for the 2003 European approval for thrombolysis. 1617 patients were aged over 80 years at trial entry. The analysis plan will be finalised, without reference to the unblinded data, and published before the trial data are unblinded in early 2012. The main trial results will be presented at the European Stroke Conference in Lisbon in May 2012 with the aim to publish simultaneously in a peer-reviewed journal. The trial result will be presented in the context of an updated Cochrane systematic review. We also intend to include the trial data in an individual patient data meta-analysis of all the relevant randomised trials.Conclusion: The data from the trial will: improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of iv rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke; provide: new evidence on the balance of risk and benefit of intravenous rtPA among types of patients who do not clearly meet the terms of the current EU approval; and, provide the first large-scale randomised evidence on effects in patients over 80, an age group which had largely been excluded from previous acute stroke trials.Trial registration: ISRCTN25765518. © 2011 Sandercock et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Respiratory tract infections are the most common syndromes at community, there are two types: upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The vast majority are started by a viral infection transforming the land vulnerable into a bacterial infection. The 2/3 of patients is treated from the onset of symptoms with antibiotics, although it is known that this treatment not positively influences the course of the disease. Renikan®, herbal extracted from the root of Pelargonium Sidoides has a threefold mechanism of action: antiviral, antibiotic and mucolytic, antiviral, because it activates the natural antiviral mechanisms of defense; antibacterial, due to its direct and indirect bacteriostatic action and mucolytic, owing to its secretomotory and expectorant properties. Objective: To test the effectiveness and tolerability of Renikan® in the treatment of respiratory infections. Materials and methods: Open design, multicenter study. We selected children 6-12 years' age and adults of any sex orrace with upper respiratory tract infections. They received Renikan® for 7 consecutive days, changes in symptoms; necessity of antibiotic use and the Integrative Medicine Outcome scale (IMOS) were evaluated. Results: Of a total of 305 patients, 156 adults and 149 children were divided into three groups: 97 Rhinosinusitis patients, who showed symptoms improvement in 86% of adults and 80% children no antibiotics use in 86% of adults and 91% of children, in 108 Tonsillitis patients, an improvement of symptoms was found in 92% of adults and 89% of children, no antibiotic use were in 86% of adults and 93% of children, and, in a third group consisting of 100 patients with bronchitis, improvement was report in 98% of adults and in 73% of children, no antibiotics were used in 88% of adults and 96% of children. The use of concomitant therapy decreased in 50% of cases and only 0.02% of patients had adverse events. Conclusions: The use of Renikan® use in patients with upper respiratory tract infections was shown to be safe and effective in both adults and children over 6 years of age. The use of Renikan® reduces bacterial complications and the need for antibiotics to treat the upper respiratory tract infections.

AB  - Photonic technology is becoming an increasingly attractive solution to the problems facing today's electronic chip-scale interconnection networks. Recent progress in silicon photonics research has enabled the demonstration of all the necessary optical building blocks for creating extremely high-bandwidth density and energy-efficient links for on-chip and off-chip communications. From the feasibility and architecture perspective however, photonics represents a dramatic paradigm shift from traditional electronic network designs due to fundamental differences in how electronics and photonics function and behave. As a result of these differences, new modeling and analysis methods must be employed in order to properly realize a functional photonic chip-scale interconnect design. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing and modeling fundamental photonic building blocks which can subsequently be combined to form full photonic network architectures. We also describe a set of tools which can be utilized to assess the physical-layer and system-level performance properties of a photonic network. The models and tools are integrated in a novel open-source design and simulation environment. We present a case study of two different photonic networks-on-chip to demonstrate how our improved understanding and modeling of the physical-layer details of photonic communications can be used to better understand the system-level performance impact. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Although potentiostats are the foundation of modern electrochemical research, they have seen relatively little application in resource poor settings, such as undergraduate laboratory courses and the developing world. One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food- and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license. © 2011 Rowe et al.

AB  - Embedded systems are a fundamental part of almost all human activities. This, coupled with the availability of free and open software development tools, opens up great possibilities for developing countries as they are not large capital investments needed for the conception, design, and manufacture of these systems. However, currently very few universities offer courses for building the skills necessary to achieve a marketable product, increasing dependence on Asian technology. This paper presents a methodology for teaching embedded system design using open hardware and software tools. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - A type of a plasmonic waveguide has been proposed featuring an "open" design that is easy to manufacture, simple to excite and offers convenient access to a plasmonic mode. Optical properties of photonic bandgap (PBG) plasmonic waveguides are investigated experimentally by leakage radiation microscopy and numerically using the finite element method confirming photonic bandgap guidance in a broad spectral range. Propagation and localization characteristics of a PBG plasmonic waveguide have been discussed as a function of the wavelength of operation, waveguide core size, and the number of ridges in the periodic reflector for fundamental and higher order plasmonic modes of the waveguide. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

AB  - This paper presents the design and testing of coaxial D-dot probes with three different designs, namely, totally closed, totally open and semi-open designs. The latter design gives a good response and has an easy-access assembly for fixing and replacing the surge arresters (SA) under test. Simultaneous measurements of residual voltage for 9-kV SA are conducted by the designed probes, and resistive and universal dividers (RD and MRCD). The divider compensation principle is also introduced and implemented for both dividers. Both perfectly compensated dividers and the designed D-dot probes have an error of about 2.5% in the SA residual voltage due to the unavoidable resistance of connecting leads. SA residual voltages measured by uncompensated short MCRD divider give good agreement with that measured by the D-dot probe. The former has small inductive overshoot which can be neglected as the residual voltage crests before the discharge current by a few microseconds. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - New open source hardware (OSH) for instrumentation and measurement are appearing regularly as the the OSH community requires more details and prefers that the journals be available online. OSH can provide a backup plan when parts are discontinued and makes it possible to publish a design in journals that specialize in instrumentation. Dr. Dan Steingart, a chemical engineering professor at the City College of New York, plans to publish an open hardware design with a Masters student, and says that such a move is expected to give him academic credit. Version tracking allows the designer to recover previous versions and create branches when major changes are made. Even if there is no OSH design that meets a project's immediate needs, it will help a user to download an OSH project and inspect the structure of the repository and the file types.

AB  - Design for (every)one is a macro framework that attempts to identify, share and use 'hidden solutions' in community-based rehabilitation contexts and translate them into disruptive assistive devices built with local resources or appropriate technology. Within healthcare contexts, local solutions are frequently more effective as they reflect the physical, emotional and cognitive needs of specific patients and engage all stakeholders in a specific local context. By using open horizontal innovation networks, where assistive devices can be easily shared and physically hacked by other allied health professionals, general patterns can be detected and translated into standard universal design objects. This generative design thinking approach is more than feasible with digital trends such as crowd sourcing, user-generated content and peer production. Cheap and powerful prototyping tools have become easier to use by non-engineers; it turns them into users as well as self-manufacturers of their personal assistive artefacts. This paper discusses the different aspects of this open innovation process within a 'design for disability' context and suggests the first steps in an iterative co-design methodology that brings together expertise from professional designers, occupational therapists, patients and other stakeholders. The overall aim is to gain more insights into designing qualitative occupational experiences for disabled users. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We investigated the effect of BoNT/A injection on hip lateralisation in children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy and bilateral adductor spasticity. Pelvic radiographs using Reimers migration index (MI) were evaluated from 27 children (n=9 females, n=18 males; mean age 5.2±1.96 years; range: 210 years; initial MI <50%) with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy over a time period of 2 years. All received injections of BoNT/A (Dysport®) every 12 weeks with a dose of 30 Units per kilogram body weight into adductor and medial hamstring muscles on both sides. The MI was calculated before treatment and after 1 and 2 years. The mean MI increased from 25.5% (range: 0-48) to 26.7% (+1.2%, range: 0-79) on the right side and from 28.0% (range: 0-40) to 30.6% (+2.6%, range: 3-84) on the left side over 2 years, respectively. Hips of one patient dislocated bilaterally. The mean MI remained stable over 2 years. Although a specific BoNT/A effect cannot be proven because of the open design of this study, we provide strong evidence that the MI can be kept stable for a time period of 2 years under non-surgical management including therapy with BoNT/A even in CP patients with a high risk for hip dislocation. © 2011 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) at micromolar or higher doses. Although cell death via NO-induced apoptosis has been studied quite extensively, the targeted delivery of such doses of NO to infected or malignant tissues has not been achieved. The primary obstacle is indiscriminate NO release from typical systemic donors such as glycerin trinitrate: once administered, the drug travels throughout the body, and NO is released through a variety of enzymatic, redox, and pH-dependent pathways.Photosensitive NO donors have the ability to surmount this difficulty through the use of light as a localized stimulus for NO delivery. The potential of the method has prompted synthetic research efforts toward new NO donors for use as photopharmaceuticals in the treatment of infections and malignancies. Over the past few years, we have designed and synthesized several metal nitrosyls (NO complexes of metals) that rapidly release NO when exposed to low-power (milliwatt or greater) light of various wavelengths. Among them, the ruthenium nitrosyls exhibit exceptional stability in biological media. However, typical ruthenium nitrosyls release NO upon exposure to UV light, which is hardly suitable for phototherapy. By following a few novel synthetic strategies, we have overcome this problem and synthesized a variety of ruthenium nitrosyls that strongly absorb light in the 400-600-nm range and rapidly release NO under such illumination. In this Account, we describe our progress in designing photoactive ruthenium nitrosyls as visible-light-sensitive NO donors.Our research has shown that alteration of the ligands, in terms of (i) donor atoms, (ii) extent of conjugation, and (iii) substituents on the ligand frames, sensitizes the final ruthenium nitrosyls toward visible light in a predictable fashion. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations provide guidance in this "smart design" of ligands. We have also demonstrated that direct attachment of dye molecules as light-harvesting antennas also sensitize ruthenium nitrosyls to visible light, and TDDFT calculations provide insight into the mechanisms of sensitization by this technique. The fluorescence of the dye ligands makes these NO donors "trackable" within cellular matrices. Selected ruthenium nitrosyls have been used to deliver NO to cellular targets to induce apoptosis. Our open-design strategies allow the isolation of a variety of these ruthenium nitrosyls, depending on the choices of the ligand frames and dyes. These designed nitrosyls will thus be valuable in the future endeavor of synthesizing novel pharmaceuticals for phototherapy. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In 1this paper we investigate produsage using Actor-Network Theory with a focus on (produsage) skills, their development, and transformation. We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background:: Acupuncture is widely used for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). There is evidence supporting acupuncture as an antidepressant monotherapy, but its efficacy as augmentation in antidepressant partial and non-responders has not been well-investigated. Methods:: Thirty subjects (47% female, mean age 48 ± 11 years) with a history of SCID-diagnosed MDD and partial or non-response after ≥ 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy were assigned 8 weeks of standardized 30-min open acupuncture augmentation sessions on a weekly (n = 24) or twice-weekly (n = 6) basis. Change in the Hamilton-D-17 score was the primary outcome measure, and response rates (based on HAM-D-17 score improvement of ≥ 50%) the secondary outcome. Results:: Twenty subjects (40% female; 18 in weekly and 2 in twice-weekly treatment) completed the study. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample (N = 30), HAM-D-17 scores decreased from 18.5 ± 3.8 to 11.2 ± 5.3 in the weekly group (p < 0.001), and from 18.5 ± 3.3 to 11.8 ± 4.8 in the twice-weekly group (p = 0.03). Improvement did not differ significantly between treatment arms (p = 0.76). Response rates were 47% for all ITT subjects, 50% for the weekly group and 33% for the twice-weekly group (p = 0.66). The most common side effects included soreness/pain (n = 7), bruising (n = 4), and mild bleeding (n = 1) at the needle site. One subject discontinued because of side effects (pain). Limitations:: Open design, small sample, polypharmacy with antidepressants. Conclusions:: Once or twice-weekly acupuncture augmentation was safe, well-tolerated and effective in antidepressant partial and non-responders, suggesting good feasibility in outpatient settings. Replication in controlled trials is warranted. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The choice of non-anthropomorphic kinematic solutions for wearable robots is motivated both by the necessity of improving the ergonomics of physical Human-Robot Interaction and by the chance of exploiting the intrinsic dynamical properties of the robotic structure so to improve its performances. Under these aspects, this new class of robotic solutions is potentially advantageous over the one of anthropomorphic robotic orthoses. However, the process of kinematic synthesis of non-anthropomorphic wearable robots can be too complex to be solved uniquely by relying on conventional synthesis methods, due to the large number of open design parameters. A systematic approach can be useful for this purpose, since it allows to obtain the complete list of independent kinematic solutions with desired properties. In this perspective, this paper presents a method, which allows to generalize the problem of kinematic synthesis of a non-anthropomorphic wearable robot for the assistance of a specified set of contiguous body segments. The methodology also includes two novel tests, specifically devised to solve the problem of enumeration of kinematic structures of wearable robots: the HR-isomorphism and the HR-degeneracy tests. This method has been implemented to derive the atlas of independent kinematic solutions suitable to be used for the kinematic design of a planar wearable robot for the lower limbs. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Recent progress in sensor networks and wireless systems provides serious difficulties to the higher education community for teaching these technologies. The complexity is so high that no practical work content is normally found in the related learning process. In this paper, a novel platform is presented for teaching Bluetooth-based wireless sensor networks and embedded systems. The system is based on a commercial "Open Hardware" device called Openmoko, a personal computer and a suite of software applications, with the objective of introducing a learner-centre approach in aforementioned fields, based on laboratory works in subjects assigned to the Telecommunication Engineering degree and the Electronic Engineering Department of the University of Seville. © IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low cost. The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework Player and, when placed within a TCP/IP networked infrastructure, provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm robotics research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Preoperative and postoperative ion concentrations were measured in 29 metal-on-metal, large-diameter head total hip arthroplasty (LDH-THA) patients. Mean chromium, cobalt (Co), and titanium levels from LDH-THA were 1.3, 2.2, and 2.7 μg/L at 12 months. The open femoral head design showed significantly higher Co concentrations than the closed design (3.0 vs 1.8 μg/L, P = .037). Compared with previously published ion levels from a hip resurfacing system presenting the same bearing characteristics, Co levels were significantly higher in LDH-THA (2.2 vs 0.7 μg/L, P < .001). This study has demonstrated that the addition of a sleeve with modular junctions and an open femoral head design of LDH-THA causes more Co release than bearing surface wear (157% and 67%, respectively). Even if no pathologic metal ion threshold level has been determined, efforts should be made to minimize its release. We recommend modification or abandonment of the modular junction and femoral head open design for this specific LDH-THA system. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Interactive value creation and especially the open innovation phenomenon have experienced constantly increasing attention during the last years. But hardly any scientific publications are available concerning the topic of open source hardware, a subsection of open innovation. Basic characteristics, like community cooperation or the openness of intellectual property could already be identified as a technological and psychological framework of the phenomenon. Due to broad access to the customers' ability to solve problems and lower commitment of capital in the facilities open source hardware companies can benefit from specific advantages. This article systematically highlights the most important characteristics and illustrates - based on an exploratory study - the upcoming opportunities for designing modern supply chains. © Carl Hanser Verlag, München.

AB  - Based on a survey, we describe the demographic and motivational structure of one open source hardware (OSH) community and compare it to open source software (OSS) communities. Taken separately, both the demographics and the motivational structure of the OSH community fall clearly within the typology of OSS communities, but when the two are taken together the OSH community forms a type of its own. We also discuss bottlenecks in OSH development revealed by the survey and subsequent interviews.

AB  - Open source (OS) has raised significant attention in industrial practice and in scholarly research as a new and successful mode of product development. This paper is among the first to study open source development processes outside their original context, the software industry. In particular, we investigate the development of tangible products in so-called open design projects. We study how open design projects address the challenges usually put forward in the literature as barriers to the open development of tangible products. The analysis rests on the comparative qualitative investigation of four cases from different industries. We find that, subject to certain contingencies, open design processes can be organized to resemble OSS development processes to a considerable degree. Some practices are established specifically to uphold OS principles in the open design context, while others starkly differ from those found in OSS development. Our discussion focusses on different aspects of modularity as well as the availability of low-cost tools. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Teaching and learning programming with a traditional classroom/ lab-based approach is challenging. Students often struggle to learn program due to lack of extensive hands-on practice and sufficient time to become familiar with programming concept. In this paper we report on an action research study of students' exploration and use of previously unexplored low-cost open-source mobile devices for learning programming. The study was conducted over a period of 14 weeks in University of West London, UK, with the postgraduate students studying Mobile Application Development (MAD) module which is a part of the MSc Network and Mobile Computing course. We introduced the Wikireader, a handheld reading device, and Nanonote, a lightweight pocket computer. In this study, we used mixed methods research methodology and data analysis was guided by the Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education (FRAME) model. The results of our evaluations indicate open-source devices have potential to enhance motivation to learn programming without being restricted to the limited practical sessions in the university lab and also facilitate offline reading.

AB  - Purpose: At 1.5 T, real-time MRI of joint movement has been shown to be feasible. However, 7 T, provides higher SNR and thus an improved potential for parallel imaging acceleration. The purpose of this work was to build an open, U-shaped eight-channel transmit/receive microstrip coil for 7 T MRI to enable high-resolution and real-time imaging of the moving ankle joint. Methods: A U-shaped eight-channel transmit/receive array for the human ankle was built. S -parameters and g -factor were measured. SAR calculations of different ankle postures were performed to ensure patient safety. Inhomogeneities in the transmit field consequent to the open design were compensated for by the use of static RF shimming. High-resolution and real-time imaging was performed in human volunteers. Results: The presented array showed good performance with regard to patient comfort and image quality. High acceleration factors of up to 4 are feasible without visible acceleration artifacts. Reasonable image homogeneity was achieved with RF shimming. Conclusions: Open, noncylindrical designs for transmit/receive coils are practical at 7 T and real-time imaging of the moving joint is feasible with the presented coil design. © 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

AB  - This paper documents the approach, methodology and outcomes of the knowledge cities (KCs) 'open design studio' (ODS) model, which allowed for the interaction of the three planning and design disciplines in the Faculty of Environmental Design at King Abdul-Aziz University. The 'ODS' methodology relied on the ability of each discipline to create its own approach to the study; working under one roof, allowing for ongoing exchange of knowledge and findings, and calling for periodical formal joint presentations to align the work of all tracks. First, the rational motives behind the adoption of the subject area, the selection of the case study, the utilisation of educational projects as a tool, and the promotion of multi-disciplinary design studio as a work environment were introduced. Next, the formation of the ODS, the development model, activities, and outcomes were presented. Lastly, a discussion highlighting the achievements, challenges and directions for future developments took place. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral miglustat treatment in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type III. The primary outcome was efficacy with improvement or stabilization in at least two domains of Vineland Adaptative Behavior Scales at 6 months. The secondary outcome measured the evolution of other cognitive tests at 12 months. The safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study. Study design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocenter, institutional, phase IIb to III study. In case of efficacy at 6 months, the study would go on for another 6 months on an open design with all patients receiving miglustat. In the absence of efficacy at 6 months, the trial had to be continued for 6 more months with the initial design. Results: After 6 months, efficacy was not superior in patients with miglustat. The independent review board confirmed continuing the study until 12 months. Conclusion: Miglustat treatment was not associated with any improvement/stabilization in behavior problems in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type III. Miglustat has an acceptable safety profile. However, the study has confirmed that miglustat is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier without significantly decreasing ganglioside levels. Copyright © 2011 Mosby Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is immunogenic, has a clinically acceptable safety profile, and prevents incident and persistent HPV-16/18 infection and cervical precancerous lesions. This study (NCT00552279) evaluated the vaccine when administered according to an alternative dosing schedule (0-1-12 months) compared with the standard dosing schedule (0-1-6 months). METHODS: The study was of randomized open design and was conducted at multiple centers in Europe. Healthy women aged 15 to 25 years were randomized (1:1) to receive HPV-16/18 vaccine according to the standard schedule at months 0, 1, and 6 (n = 401) or an alternative schedule at months 0, 1, and 12 (n = 403). HPV-16 and -18 antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at months 0, 2, and 7 or 13 (depending on group); noninferiority evaluation was performed sequentially for seroconversion rates and geometric mean antibody titers. Primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the according-to-protocol cohort. Vaccine safety and reactogenicity were assessed on the total vaccinated cohort. RESULTS: Predefined noninferiority criteria were met 1 month after the third vaccine dose when the HPV-16/18 vaccine was administered according to the 0-1-12 month schedule compared with the 0-1-6 month schedule in terms of seroconversion rates for HPV-16 (100% and 100%) and HPV-18 (99.7% and 100%) and geometric mean antibody titers for HPV-16 (11884.7 and 10311.9 ELISA units/mL) and HPV-18 (4501.3 and 3963.6 ELISA units/mL), respectively. The HPV-16/18 vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile when administered according to either schedule. CONCLUSIONS: The third dose of the HPV-16/18 vaccine can be administered any time between 6 and 12 months after the first dose, with adequate immunogenicity and a clinically acceptable safety profile. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - The use of customizable open-source software and affordable low-power open-hardware devices can help in building personalized connected-home applications. Open hardware, such as the BeagleBoard-xM and HawkBoard development boards, along with open software, such as the GeeXboX uShare media server and the XBMC media center, give developers the control to create an individualized, cost-efficient, and expandable system that allows them to quickly close the feature gap between the available and the desired solution. A networked media server can act as the basis of connected home applications and lets the owner share media among multiple local or remote network devices. The use of an an open platform with the right performance, peripherals, and connectivity options in combination with the appropriate open-source software will allow developers to join communities of other developers working jointly, to solve a shared set of problems.

AB  - Open-source communities that focus on content rely squarely on the contributions of invisible strangers in cyberspace. How do such communities handle the problem of trusting that strangers have good intentions and adequate competence? This question is explored in relation to communities in which such trust is a vital issue: peer production of software (FreeBSD and Mozilla in particular) and encyclopaedia entries (Wikipedia in particular). In the context of open-source software, it is argued that trust was inferred from an underlying 'hacker ethic', which already existed. The Wikipedian project, by contrast, had to create an appropriate ethic along the way. In the interim, the assumption simply had to be that potential contributors were trustworthy; they were granted 'substantial trust'. Subsequently, projects from both communities introduced rules and regulations which partly substituted for the need to perceive contributors as trustworthy. They faced a design choice in the continuum between a high-discretion design (granting a large amount of trust to contributors) and a low-discretion design (leaving only a small amount of trust to contributors). It is found that open-source designs for software and encyclopaedias are likely to converge in the future towards a mid-level of discretion. In such a design the anonymous user is no longer invested with unquestioning trust. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents the conceptual design and technical solutions for the bridge over the artificial lake of Ptuj (power plant reservoir on the Drava River) on the new south main road, which connects the city of Ptuj with the Maribor-Zagreb motorway. The horizontal axis of the 430,0 m long and 18,0 m wide bridge has a radius of curvature of R = 460,0 m. The bridge is designed as an "extrados bridge," representing an intermediate form between girder bridges and cable-stayed bridges. Structural spans of the bridge are 65 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 65 = 430 m. In the cross section the bridge is a mono-cellular, box-shaped, longitudinally prestressed concrete girder; H = 2,70 m, with classic prestressing tendons inside and additional exterior extrados cables over the low pylons. The conceptual design won the open design competition in 2004 and the final tender design was completed in March 2005. The construction of the innovatively designed "extrados bridge" started in November 2005, and the bridge was opened for traffic in May 2007. © 2010.

AB  - A modular architecture model of a computer-supported collaborative design (CSCD) system is proposed on the basis of the hierarchical structure characteristics of a distributed collaborative design system and advanced component object technology. The model mainly regards the module as the core organizing and managing design objects and uses the common object request broker architecture (CORBA) specifications as an interactive platform to achieve object communication. The browser/server computing model deals with the remote heterogeneous collaborative design problem. Product design strategies and mechanisms for collaborative design are separated to facilitate the application of distributed collaborative design environment for quick implementation. The open design framework for CSCD system developers can support the implementation of distributed collaborative design to improve product design speed and reduce product development time. The modular CSCD system (MCSCDS) model and its implementation are achieved in the modular CSCD, a prototype system. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Patients treated in a health centre can present conditions related to the caregiving process itself. The negative effects, as a consequence of invasive procedures, imply high morbimortality, and infections acquired in those settings are one of the most frequents complictions. Study aim: Identifying and describing the practice patterns of clinicians in terms of prevention in Primary Health Care. The qualitative methodology used was an emerging and open design that allowed for an in-depth insight of a complex reality that is barely known. Data collection was carried out through discussion groups. Setting: Primary care centres from the sanitary Area 6 of Madrid (Spain). Subjects: Physicians, nurses and nursing assistants that met the inclusion criteria. The sampling was purposeful, of maximum variability. Results: Data pondering and analysis led to awareness of the problem and adoption of an improvement strategy. © 2011 Fundación Index.

AB  - Double patterning lithography (DPL) is in current production for memory products, and is widely viewed as inevitable for logic products at the 32 nm node. DPL decomposes and prints the shapes of a critical-layer layout in two exposures. In traditional single-exposure lithography, adjacent identical layout features will have identical mean critical dimension (CD), and spatially correlated CD variations. However, with DPL, adjacent features can have distinct mean CDs, and uncorrelated CD variations. This introduces a new set of bimodal challenges for timing analysis and optimization. We assess the potential impact of bimodal CD distribution on timing analysis and guardbanding, and find that the traditional unimodal characterization and analysis framework may not be viable for DPL. We propose new bimodal-aware timing analysis and optimization methods to improve timing yield of standard-cell based designs that are manufactured using DPL. Our first contribution is a DPL-aware approach to timing modeling, based on detailed analysis of cell layouts. Our second contribution is an integer linear programming-based maximization of alternate mask coloring of instances in timing-critical paths, to minimize harmful covariance and performance variation. Third, we propose a dynamic programming-based detailed placement algorithm that solves mask coloring conflicts and can be used to ensure double patterning correctness after placement or even after detailed routing, while minimizing the displacement of timing-critical cells with manageable engineering change order (ECO) impact. With a 45 nm library and open-source design testcases, our timing-aware recoloring and placement optimization together achieve up to 271 ps (respectively, 55.75 ns) reduction in worst (respectively, total) negative slack, and 70% (respectively, 72%) reduction in worst (respectively, total) negative slack variation, respectively. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The study attempted to identify clinical variables which could predict the response to a second-generation antipsychotic treatment during acute episodes among schizophrenic patients. Socio-demographic, premorbid and clinical variables were studied in a population of 95 diagnosed with schizophrenia, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSMIV), during an acute treated phase, in a multicentre prospective study. Patients were assigned to olanzapine or risperidone treatment in an open design. Clinical evaluations were performed at D0, D42 and D180. Good response to treatment was defined as a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) reduction greater than 20% and a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score lower than 35. Univariate analysis revealed earlier age at onset of schizophrenia and earlier age at first prescription of antipsychotic among non-responders compared with good responders at D42. Non-responders also had a clinical profile at the onset of antipsychotic treatment characterised by more severe forms of the acute episode as shown by higher scores at the positive, general and overall PANSS scale and on CGI-S and BPRS scores. With a multivariate logistic regression model, age at onset and overall duration of illness remained the only clinical criteria identified as predictors of response to antipsychotic treatment at D42. Clinical variables do not clearly appear to be good predictors of treatment efficacy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aims. The aim of the study was to determine whether a high dose of atorvastatin lowers blood pressure (BP) in normolipemic patients with well controlled primary arterial hypertension and if this effect is associated with alteration of biomarkers of endothelial function and oxidative stress. In this open-label study, normolipemic patients (n56) were randomized in the proportion of 2:1 to receive atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 3 months (statin-treated, ST n39), or to previous therapy (statin-free, SF). BP was measured using a 24-h ambulatory BP measurement device. Plasma levels of 6-keto-PGF1α (prostacyclin metabolite), serum nitric oxide (NO) and levels of autoantibodies immunoglobulin G against oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were measured. Major findings. The mean change in systolic BP and diastolic BP for ST was 5.7 mmHg (95% CI 4.1 to 7.2 mmHg) and 3.9 mmHg (95% CI 2.7 to 5.0 mmHg), respectively. Hypotensive statin effect was independent of lipid lowering. No change of BP in SF patients was observed. In ST, prostacyclin metabolites and NO concentrations were not significantly increased and autoantibodies against ox-LDL concentrations did not change. In ST, the decrease in BP correlated with increase in NO and decrease in autoantibodies against ox-LDL. Principal conclusion. High-dose atorvastatin resulted in reduction of BP independently of lipid-lowering effect, changes in endothelial function and oxidative stress, but it was related to the increase in NO and decrease in autoantibodies against ox-LDL. However, because of the open design of the study, these results should be carefully debated. © 2010 Scandinavian Foundation for Cardiovascular Research.

AB  - Objective: N-acethyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), one of the component of cartilage, are investigated the effectiveness to knee osteoarthritis (KOA) symptoms. We assessed the effects of the administration of milk beverage containing GlcNAc on the biomarkers, CTX-II and C2C that associated with type II collagen degradation, CP II that associated with type II collagen synthesis, and their ratio (CTX- II /CP II, C2C/CP II). Method: An open trial was conducted in 20 subjects with knee pains. Subjects, aged 40-84 years, were administered milk beverage (100 mL/day) that contains 1200 mg of GlcNAc for 16 weeks. JOA score, JKOM (Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure) score, VAS (visual analogue scale), and biochemical markers derived from type II collagen were evaluated. Results: Intake of test beverage induced significant improvement in JOA total score, JKOM total score, and VAS. C2C and CP II, which are biomarkers derived from type II collagen, were both significantly increased, whereas ratio of CTX- II /CP II was significantly decreased, and ratio of C2C/CP II was substantially decreased, compared with before administration. No significant abnormal laboratory results or adverse events related to the treatment were detected, and no significantly difference in body weight, which is the risk factor of KOA, was observed during the study. Conclusion: The present results revealed that intake of test beverage rapidly and safely reduced the subjective symptoms from KOA. Moreover, test beverage also improved the metabolism of type II collagen, by increasing type II collagen synthesis relatively to degradation. Therefore, it is suggested that the intake of milk beverage containing GlcNAc could induce the improvement of KOA symptoms and Type II collagen metabolism.

AB  - Virtual design tools are gaining more and more importance in the production process of medical devices. Biomedical devices and their surrounding boundary conditions are usually characterized by complex geometrical shapes, materials and interactions, and current Abaqus capabilities in dealing with highly nonlinear problems are highly needed to realistically capture these complexities. As an example, stents can be laser-cut or braided, driven by folded balloons to expand or be self-expanding and they interact with stenosed, tortuous, highly non-linear and anisotropic blood vessels. In order to investigate in detail some of the above mentioned aspects of stenting we have developed a dedicated pre- and postprocessing tool based on the open-source design software pyFormex. The enormous potential of combining this design environment with Abaqus is illustrated in this paper, focusing on balloon- and self-expanding stents, embolic protection filters and patient specific modeling. This paper aims at providing a survey of the latest developments carried out in our research unit in this area and detailed information with respect to the simulations can be found in the cited works. © Society for Biomaterials and Artificial Organs (India), 2010.

AB  - Background: Obesity is considered an important factor contributing to premature arterial stiffening in type 2 diabetes but it is uncertain whether weight loss through dietary modification leads to a reduction in arterial stiffness. Rimonabant is an anti-obesity drug which, through its pharmacological action of cannabinoid receptor blockade, could exert effects on central haemodynamics. Methods: In an open design, 29 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes were studied. Subjects were studied before, during and after 6 months dietary intervention with (20 subjects), or without (9 subjects) rimonabant. Arterial stiffness (aortic and brachial pulse wave velocity), central aortic pressure and wave reflection were assessed non-invasively (Sphygmocor). Results: After 6 months (in comparison with baseline), there were reductions in weight (104 ± 21 versus 107 ± 21 Kg, p < 0.001), and improvements in HbA1c (7.3 ± 1.4 at 3 months, p < 0.01 and 7.4 ± 1.5 at 6 months, p = 0.06 versus 7.7 ± 1.5% at baseline) and HDL cholesterol (1.3 ± 0.2 versus 1.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L, p < 0.001). Aortic diastolic pressure (82 ± 10 versus 85 ± 8 mmHg, p < 0.05) was lowered despite unchanged peripheral mean arterial pressure. No reductions in aortic stiffness or wave reflection were observed. Conclusion: Dietary manipulation led to significant weight loss and favourable metabolic effects. These beneficial changes did not lead to a reduction in aortic stiffness or pressure wave reflection despite a fall in central aortic blood pressure. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.

AB  - Several automobile manufacturers such as Ford and Honda have developed new hybrids and all-electric cars as their concept vehicles which are not only flamboyant but functional and more importantly environmental friendly. Blue-Will, a hybrid launched by Hyundai, has dye-sensitized solar cells mounted on its glass roof for electricity generation and regenerative brakes. Thin transparent organic LED (TOLED) installed on the unusual steering column has replaced the conventional gage cluster inside the car. The Beachcomber, a four-wheel-drive, four seater vehicle developed by Mini, is the technological advancement of Mini Moke from the 1960. The open design of the car eliminates the need for air vents and the space thus left is used for mount speakers for the stereo system. The car is designed to travels on run-flat tires to increase storage space. Cadillac's XTS Platinum is a spacious luxury car which has a 3.6-liter V6, paired with an electric drive, four-door sedan about hp and 295-lb-ft of torque and runs on magnetorheological shocks.

AB  - A crossed-loop (orthogonal mode) resonator (CLR) was constructed of fine wire to achieve design goals for rapid scan in vivo EPR imaging at VHF frequencies (in practice, near 250 MHz). This application requires the resonator to have a very open design to facilitate access to the animal for physiological support during the image acquisition. The rapid scan experiment uses large amplitude magnetic field scans, and sufficiently large resonator and detection bandwidths to record the rapidly-changing signal response. Rapid-scan EPR is sensitive to RF/microwave source noise and to baseline changes that are coherent with the field scan. The sensitivity to source noise is a primary incentive for using a CLR to isolate the detected signal from the RF source noise. Isolation from source noise of 44 and 47 dB was achieved in two resonator designs. Prior results showed that eddy currents contribute to background problems in rapid scan EPR, so the CLR design had to minimize conducting metal components. Using fine (AWG 38) wire for the resonators decreased eddy currents and lowered the resonator Q, thus providing larger resonator bandwidth. Mechanical resonances at specific scan frequencies are a major contributor to rapid scan backgrounds. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Multi-agent modeling method is used to establish four categories' agent, i.e., industry agent, market agent, government agent and resident agent, and mechanism is designed to develop dynamic economy and power simulation system. This study simulates the impact of policies on the fluctuation of economy and power demand through simulating the changes of economic individuals by cooperation and interaction among related agents. With the semi-open design, expert is able to endow his intelligence with open-agent whenever necessary, which enhances the intelligence of agent involved. Finally, by simulating the influence of economy and power demand accrued by international finance crisis in 2008, the result obtained shows that the proposed model sufficiently reflects the relationship between policy and power demand. Therefore, it provides an effective tool to analyze economy and electric power for decision maker. © Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.

AB  - Moving object segmentation plays an important role in a complex object tracking system. This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (HAV) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity. The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system. ©2010 Society for Imaging Science and Technology:.

AB  - Traditionally the protection of intellectual property is regarded as a precondition for value capture. The rise of open source (OS) software and OS tangible products, so-called open design, has challenged this understanding. Openness is often regarded as a dichotomous variable (open-source vs. closed-source) and it is assumed that online developer communities demand full opening of the product’s source. In this paper we will explore openness as a gradual and multi-dimensional concept. We carried out an Internet survey (N = 270) among participants of 20 open design communities in the domain of IT hardware and consumer electronics. We find that open design projects pursue complex strategies short of complete openness and that communities value openness of software more highly than openness of hardware. Our findings suggest that open design companies can successfully implement strategies of partial openness to safeguard value capture without alienating their developer community. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The thermal cylinder head test rig presents an innovative method for assessing and optimizing cylinder heads in relation to their service strength vs. thermo mechanical fatigue at a very early stage in their development process. The test rig makes it possible to reduce the testing times and costs significantly in comparison with standard engine test benches, thus shortening the development time for new cylinder head designs. The test rig's novel, open design also makes it possible to detect crack formation and investigation of crack propagation in the pent roof across thermo shock cycles for the very first time. Inspection procedures do not require the assembly of the entire engine for fuelled operation.

AB  - The objective of this article is to conceptually transfer the concept of open source software (OSS) development to scientific entrepreneurship and to hypothetically discuss the support potentials of this rather new development philosophy for what we than call open scientific entrepreneurship. Therefore, at first the authors will go into conceptual details of scientific entrepreneurship and than of OSS development. Following, the main thrust of the article presents open scientific entrepreneurship from two points of origin: first of all, OSS development as a specific form of scientific e-entrepreneurship and further on potential benefits of opening "traditional" scientific entrepreneurship up by looking at specific action fields. These action fields are theoretically based on the process and competence perspective of scientific entrepreneurship. Finally, the general benefits as well as downsides of the concept of openness are discussed on a generic level. It becomes obvious that there is need for balancing the tensions between an open and closed design pattern for scientific entrepreneurship with a general emphasis on the open design perspective.

AB  - Background: Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder. Although prevention is the core of treatment for most, some patients are refractory to standard therapies. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of Quetiapine (QTP) in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine, defined as previous unresponsiveness to the combination of atenolol, nortriptyline, and flunarizine. Methods: Thirty-four consecutive patients (30 women and 4 men) with migraine (ICHD-II), fewer than 15 days of headache per month, and not overusing symptomatic medications were studied. All participants had failed to the combination of atenolol (60 mg/day), nortriptyline (25 mg/day), and flunarizine (3 mg/day). Failure was defined as <50% reduction in attack frequency after 10 weeks of treatment. After other medications were discontinued, QTP was initiated at a single daily dose of 25 mg, and then titrated to 75 mg. After 10 weeks, headache frequency, consumption of rescue medications, and adverse events were analyzed. Results: Twenty-nine patients completed the study. Three patients withdrew and two were lost to follow-up. Among those who completed, 22 (75.9%; 64.7% of the intention-to-treat population) had greater than 50% headache reduction. The mean frequency of migraine days decreased from 10.2 to 6.2 per month. Use of rescue medications decreased from 2.3 to 1.2 days/week. Adverse events were reported by nine (31%) patients. Conclusions: Although limited by the open design, this study provides pilot data to support the use of QTP in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine. Controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations. © American Academy of Pain Medicine.

AB  - Objective: Long-acting injectible antipsychotic agents are rarely considered in the treatment of bipolar patients [bipolar disorder (BPD)]. We posited that BPD patients receiving risperidone long-acting injections [Risperidone long-acting injections (RLAIs)] would experience fewer negative clinical events than those receiving oral atypical antipsychotic agents (AAP). Methods: Adult BPD patients in a hypomanic, manic or mixed episode were randomised to either oral risperdone followed by RLAI (n = 23) or an AAP (n = 25) for 15 months. Any mood stabilizers were continued. An independent clinician board declared any clinical events that occurred but the treatment assignment was concealed. Results: Nine of the 48 patients who participated in this study did not improve, leaving 39 patients in 1-year extension. RLAI patients received the following bi-weekly dosages: 25 mg (n = 9), 37.5 mg (n = 8), and 50 mg (n = 6). The AAP group included aripiprazole (n = 11, 15-30 mg/day), quetiapine (n = 8, 300-700 mg/day), olanzapine (n = 5, 15-25 mg/day), and ziprasidone, (n = 1, 160 mg/day). In total, 47 clinical events were declared. The RLAI-treated group experienced significantly fewer clinical events (mean: 0.86 ± 0.73) compared with the AAP group (1.61 ± 1.29), t = 2.29, d.f. = 37, p = 0.028 (95% CI = 0.087-1.421). Of all, 50% of the AAP subjects gained ≥ 7% of their baseline body weight as did 38% of the RLAI-treated patients. Conclusions: RLAI-treated patients experienced significantly fewer negative clinical events. Further exploration should focus on which subtypes of BPD patients might benefit from RLAI treatment. Weight gain in BPD subjects requires clinical attention. Limitations include an open design, small sample size and the inability to conclude on whether this strategy is useful for depressive episodes. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - A survey and comparison of King's Buildings Campus (KB) and Informatics Forum was undertaken by the University of Edinburgh to review the narrow design fire specifications of the Eurocodes for many new buildings. Twenty-eight of the main buildings in the KB campus were inspected out of which 26 that have one or more enclosures fall outside the applicability of the Eurocode. The rooms/enclosures that were out of range with the Eurocode limitations were atriums open between floors, laboratories or workshops with skylights in the roof, larger lecture theatres where the height was over 4m, and floor areas over 500m2. The Informatics Forum at the University of Edinburgh had an open design that is beyond the range of applicability of traditional design methods. In the Informatics Forum, 8% of the total volume is inside the limitations. The difference in both the buildings could be due to the construction period.

AB  - Background: The OxyMask™ is a unique, open-style, oxygen mask that was originally developed in 2005. The original mask was modified, using computational fluid dynamics numerical simulations, with the goal of allowing it to produce a wider range of FiO2. This analysis was used to guide the modification of the mask shell and the location for the oxygen diffuser. Methods: The new OxyMask was attached to 10 healthy subjects and used to deliver escalating levels of oxygen (1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 LPM) for 90 seconds at each level and the resulting FiO2 was recorded (at the lips) from 5 consecutive measurements at each oxygen flow rate. Results: Mean FiO2 was 25.4% at 1.5 LPM of oxygen, 30.1% at 2 LPM, 36.5% at 2.5 LPM, 41.8% at 3 LPM, 57.6% at 5 LPM, 74.4% at 10 LPM, and 80.1% at 15 LPM. Each FiO2 achieved at these escalating oxygen levels was significantly greater than all the previous levels. The mean FiO2 was 82.8 at 20 LPM, 84.2% at 25 LPM and 84.3% at 30 LPM. All of these values on average were not significantly greater than the FiO2 achieved with 15 LPM. In a few subjects a maximum FiO2 of 90% was reached. Conclusion: The original OxyMask was successfully modified so that the second generation of the mask can provide a wide range of FiO2, from 25% to 90%, while keeping its unique open design.

AB  - This open study exploredwhether methylphenidate could be tolerated and effective in improving the quality of life (QOL) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms of children with epilepsy and ADHD. Twenty-five subjects (aged 10.1 ± 3.0 years) with ADHD and epilepsy were recruited at an outpatient clinic in Seoul, Korea. We used the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE), ADHD rating scale (ARS) and clinical global impression (CGI) in this study. Osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (OROS) methylphenidate, 1.0 ± 0.4 mg/kg/day, was administered for 55.2 ± 7.5 days. The QOL subscales including physical restriction (p = 0.005), self-esteem (p = 0.002), memory (p < 0.001), language (p = 0.005), other cognition (p < 0.001), social interaction (p = 0.002), behaviour (p < 0.001), general health (p = 0.002) and QOL (p < 0.001) were significantly increased and the ARS (p < 0.001) and CGI-Severity of illness scores (p < 0.001) were significantly reduced after medication. Although 60% of subjects had experienced adverse effects, most were tolerable and only two subjects withdrew from the study owing to unbearable adverse effects (anorexia and insomnia). Two subjects had seizure attacks during the study period without having to discontinue the trial drug. Despite limitations related to the small sample size and the open design of the present pilot study, our results suggest that OROS methylphenidate may be well tolerated and effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and improving QOL in this patient population.

AB  - In December 2008, the European Council and the European Parliament agreed on a final compromise for a new European renewable energy directive. One of the most debated issues prior to this compromise was the design of "target flexibility mechanisms", which should allow member states with low or expensive renewable energy potential to partly fulfil their national renewable energy target in other countries. This article traces back the political discussion that has led to the evolution of the different flexibility options. It then evaluates the most prominent flexibility mechanisms against a set of qualitative criteria. It concludes that free or restricted certificate trade based on guarantees of origin (GOs) - as proposed earlier by the European Commission - is not a viable option due to some "knockout" criteria, despite other potential advantages. The mechanisms that have replaced GO trade in the final compromise - joint projects, joint support schemes and statistical transfer between member states - provide less flexibility, but score better against a number of other important criteria. The crucial question for the coming years is how their utilisation can be facilitated. One first step might be that proactive member states define open design issues for implementing the mechanisms. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article introduces a computer numerical control (CNC)-based open hardware architecture system to realize the special functions of automated tape-laying (ATL) in a numerical control system. It associates a programmable multi-axis controller (PMAC) as the motion control unit with programmable numerical controllers (PCL-725, PCL-730) for on-off control. To bring about synchronized movements of the main 5-axis tape-laying head system and the 3-axis ultrasonic tape-cutting sub-system, the tracking-control method associated with time-based mode attributed to PMAC is applied in different cases. In addition, with the goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000 system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also designed. This system is helpful to solve complicated problems in designing numerical controls for ATL such as ensuring high requirements for precise machine control and synchronization of motion control and on-off control. © 2009 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

AB  - The use of better quality steel cord conveyor belts has eliminated the problem of corrosion. This problem has been eliminated due to the use of better quality hot-galvanized cords of a special open design combined with special rubber compounds and the latest production technology. These materials, modern processes, and additional protection provided by cascaded ramps and synthetic traverse cord reinforcement present several advantages for the slices, including resistance and corrosion. Splices made using the latest technology can last as long as the entire conveyor belt, sometimes exceeding 30 years on significantly long conveyors.

AB  - Advances in steel-cord conveyor belts and belt splicing are improving performance in key mining applications. Corrosion is no longer a problem on top-class steel-cord conveyor belts, even when they have exterior damage. This is due to the use of high-quality, hot-galvanized cords of a special open design, combined with highly flowable and adhesive special rubber compounds and state-of-the-art production technology. The splice is the weakest point on an endless conveyor belt. Statically, it is usually easy to achieve a tensile strength that corresponds to that of the belt. Finite element programs are used to theoretically develop the optimum splice geometry. The splices must also be constructed with (chloroprene rubber) CR, which required a new splice design in view of the molecular structure which deviates from the usual SBRJNR compounds and the vulcanization process.

AB  - Open source software development has received considerable scholarly attention, much of which is based on the presumption that the 'open source model' holds some lessons of broader applicability. Nonetheless, our knowledge of its deployment outside the software industry is very limited. This paper focuses on the open source development of tangible objects, the so-called open design. We propose a generalised definition of open source development. Drawing on 27 exploratory interviews and six comparative case studies selected from a pool of more than 75 projects, we analyse the workings of open design. The analysis reveals that open design is already being implemented in a substantial variety of projects with different organisational and institutional structures. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: In patients with acute ischaemic stroke and hyperglycaemia, prolonged strict glycaemic control may improve clinical outcome. The question is how to achieve this prolonged strict glycaemic control. In this study, the efficacy and safety of two regimens with different basal to meal related insulin ratio are described. Methods: 33 patients with ischaemic stroke and hyperglycaemia at admission were randomised in an open design to receive: (1) conventional glucose lowering therapy, (2) strict glucose control with predominantly basal insulin using intravenous insulin or (3) strict glucose control with predominantly meal related insulin using subcutaneous insulin in the first 5 days after stroke. The target range of glucose control for the last two groups was 4.4-6.1 mmol/l. 16 consecutive patients without hyperglycaemia at admission were included to serve as normoglycaemic controls. Results: The median area under the curve (AUC) in the meal related insulin group was 386 mmol/lx58 h (range 286-662) for days 2-5, and did not differ from the hyperglycaemic control group (median AUC 444 mmol/l x58 h; range 388-620). There was also no difference in median AUC of the basal insulin group (453 mmol/l x58 h, range 347-629) and the hyperglycaemic control group on days 2-5. In the first 12 hours, glucose profiles were lower in the groups treated with strict glucose control; median AUC was 90 mmol/lx12 h (range 77-189) for the hyperglycaemic control group versus 81 mmol/lx12 h (range 60-118) for the meal related insulin group (p = 0.03) and 74 mmol/lx12 h (range 52-97) for the basal insulin group (p = 0.008). Conclusion: In intermittently fed ischaemic stroke patients, strict glycaemic control between day 2 and day 5 with two different basal bolus regimens did not result in lower glucose profiles due to postprandial hyperglycaemia. Continuous enteral feeding may therefore be needed to achieve prolonged strict glycaemic control in acute stroke patients.

AB  - Current diagnostic tools for the assessment of lung function are limited by global measurements or the need for radioactive tracers. Ideally, these tools should allow quantitative, regional distinct analyses without exposure to radiation. The current paper presents oxygen-enhanced functional MRI for assessment of lung ventilation. First applied in humans in 1996, a considerable amount of experience is now available on 1.5T scanners. The generation of quantitative T1-maps shows a high clinical potential. Low-field MR scanners, which are mostly open-designed, are especially interesting for functional lung imaging. The open design has advantages in respect to patient comfort by lower noise production and easy access to the patients and the costs are lower (no need for helium cooling). Lower signal-to-noise ratios can be overcome by changing the relaxation times. New navigator techniques allow further compensations. This article focuses on the presentation of low-field scanners and the application of T1 and T2* maps is described for healthy volunteers and first patients. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.

AB  - We are facing a probable great change in the way we carry through design in future ICT supported environments. The main driving forces are the digitalization of information handling leading to a paramount paradigm shift when information storage and access media are separated, building process and product systems are formalized in digital models, user environments are provided with rich adaptable multimedia access to virtual models, virtual collaboration rooms established, and new efficient and effective ICT tools defined and implemented. There are though some barriers putting strains on the development. Among the most important are missing ontologies both on business and Web/Internet service levels as well as their interrelations, poor user involvement in needs and requirements formulations on new ICT tools as well as in continuous user involvement in design and evaluation of new user environments, lack of interoperability within building process/product models, and the effects of local community behavior on global scale. The general competence level and preparedness for organizational and work change due to globalization and development of new common grounds for building design needs to be increased. The paper presents a roadmap for development of future Integrated Building Design Systems (IBDS) with enduser participation. Methods for development of tools supporting creative and innovative building design with end-user participation is taking into account, including methods for capture and modeling of explicit and implicit end-user needs and requirements on both the building to be designed and the supporting design tools. The paper provides grounds to higher success rate in capture of explicit and implicit end user needs and requirements on functional performance in use and re-use of buildings, taking into account effective tools for creative and innovative design. Providing a common ground for successful building design system development and meta-level agreements on open design systems supporting different design contexts and end user needs and values. The roadmap timeframe is 3-10 years. © 2009 The authors.

AB  - The author conducted a 3-week qualitative case study at the School of Environmental Studies (SES), a senior public school with an environmental studies focus. He argues that SES's physical design facilitates collaborative, multidisciplinary teaching practices especially suited to the school's environmental studies curriculum. He also shows that the school's open plan architecture positively contributes to the social climate at SES. Students who were interviewed as part of the study expressed a preference for the open plan setting over conventional classrooms because the open design helps them socially connect with a larger number of peers than would be possible in a more enclosed environment. Students consequently felt more socially accepted at SES and better enjoyed their time in school in comparison with other high schools they had attended. © 2009 Heldref Publications.

AB  - This paper deals with the development of an open design platform for characterization of mechanical cellular behavior. The resulting setup combines Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) techniques and advanced robotic approaches in order to carry out both prolonged observations and spatial measurements on biological samples. Visual and force feedback is controlled to achieve automatic data acquisition and to monitor process when high skills are required. The issue of the spring constant calibration is addressed using an accurate dynamic vibration approach. Experimentation on the mechanical cell characterization under in vitro conditions on human adherent Epithelial Hela cells demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of the proposed setup. Finally, the JKR (Johnson, Kendall and Roberts), the DMT (Derjaguin, Muller and Toporov) and Hertz contact theories are used to estimate the contact area between the cantilever and the biological sample. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper revisits the problem of the readiness for field deployments of wireless sensor networks by assessing the relevance of using Open Hardware and Software motes for environment monitoring. We propose a new prototype wireless sensor network that finetunes SquidBee motes to improve the life-time and sensing performance of an environment monitoring system that measures temperature, humidity and luminosity. Building upon two outdoor sensing scenarios, we evaluate the performance of the newly proposed energy-aware prototype solution in terms of link quality when expressed by the Received Signal Strength, Packet Loss and the battery lifetime. The experimental results reveal the relevance of using the Open Hardware and Software motes when setting up outdoor wireless sensor networks. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - To enable the open architecture Computer Numerical Control (CNC) system to be independent of specific hardware and software platforms, the NC pipeline architecture was proposed. The pipeline architecture was consisted of a NC pipeline thread, a driver and a NC Microcode Processor (NCMP). The NC Canonical Command (NCCC) interface and the NC Microcode (NCM) interface were defined to ensure the inter-changeability of different modules and the reconfiguration of the pipeline. The primary control functions from code interpretation to NCM generation were encapsulated in the NC pipeline thread. Standard programming interface and software development techniques were employed to guarantee the portability of the NC pipeline thread. The NCMP utilized reconfigurable open hardware to execute the NCM and perform the real-time control functions. The non-real-time section and real-time section of the NC pipeline was isolated by the NCM buffer. The experiment showed that the NC pipeline architecture was applicable to a wide range of general hardware and software platforms, and it provided a practical approach to construct open architecture CNC systems.

AB  - Direct interfacing of transected peripheral nerves with advanced robotic prosthetic devices has been proposed as a strategy for achieving natural motor control and sensory perception of such bionic substitutes, thus fully functionally replacing missing limbs in amputees. Multi-electrode arrays placed in the brain and peripheral nerves have been used successfully to convey neural control of prosthetic devices to the user. However, reactive gliosis, micro hemorrhages, axonopathy and excessive inflammation currently limit their long-term use. Here we demonstrate that enticement of peripheral nerve regeneration through a non-obstructive multi-electrode array, after either acute or chronic nerve amputation, offers a viable alternative to obtain early neural recordings and to enhance long-term interfacing of nerve activity. Non-restrictive electrode arrays placed in the path of regenerating nerve fibers allowed the recording of action potentials as early as 8 days post-implantation with high signal-to-noise ratio, as long as 3 months in some animals, and with minimal inflammation at the nerve tissue-metal electrode interface. Our findings suggest that regenerative multi-electrode arrays of open design allow early and stable interfacing of neural activity from amputated peripheral nerves and might contribute towards conveying full neural control and sensory feedback to users of robotic prosthetic devices. © 2009 Garde, Keefer, Botterman, Galvan and Romero.

AB  - This article presents the development of a metamodel and an open-source design environment for the synchronous language Signal in the Gme and Eclipse frameworks. This environment is intended to be used as a pivot modeling tool for a customized, aspect-oriented and application-driven, computer-aided engineering of embedded systems starting from multiple and heterogeneous initial specifications. The metamodel, called SignalMeta, is defined on top of the design workbench Polychrony, which is dedicated to Signal programming. Automated transformations are defined and implemented in order to produce, analyze, statically verify and model-check programs obtained from high-level models. The proposed approach promotes model-driven engineering within a framework that strongly favors formal validation. It aims at significantly decreasing design costs while improving the quality of systems. We demonstrate the agility of this approach by considering the design of both control-oriented and avionic systems. We start with an implementation of core polychronous1From the Greek words poly and chronos: multiple and time1 data-flow concepts in Gme and show the ease of its modular extension with application-specific concepts such as mode automata or integrated modular avionics concepts. This work is the first attempt to generalize the formal model of computation and the design philosophy of Polychrony. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extensive research has been done to analyze the phenomenon of open source software development from various perspectives. By contrast little is known about open source development of tangible objects, so-called open design, so far. Until recently, limitations to the availability of successful empirical examples of this 'new innovation model' outside software may have been a key reason for this gap. This paper contributes to the literature on the open source mode of product development by providing a quantitative study (N = 85) of open design projects. Our goal is to explore the landscape of open source development in the world of atoms, to analyze project characteristics, structures, and success, and to investigate similarities and dissimilarities to open source software development.

AB  - The theory of combinatorial designs has always been a rich source of structured, parametrized families of SAT instances. On one hand, design theory provides interesting problems for testing various SAT solvers; on the other hand, high-performance SAT solvers provide an alternative tool for attacking open problems in design theory, simply by encoding problems as propositional formulas, and then searching for their models using off-the-shelf general purpose SAT solvers. This chapter presents several case studies of using SAT solvers to solve hard design theory problems, including quasigroup problems, Ramsey numbers, Van der Waerden numbers, covering arrays, Steiner systems, and Mendelsohn designs. It is shown that over a hundred of previously-open design theory problems were solved by SAT solvers, thus demonstrating the significant power of modern SAT solvers. Moreover, the chapter provides a list of 30 open design theory problems for the developers of SAT solvers to test their new ideas and weapons. © 2009 John Franco and John Martin and IOS Press.

AB  - How does a newly diagnosed user get inducted into a forum dedicated to people suffering from bipolar disorder? Is their opening message "matched" by the forum's reply? We add to the literature on social support online by using conversation analysis (CA) to explore an apparent contradiction between a new user's first post and forum members' replies with ostensibly unsolicited advice. CA reveals the intimate relation between turns in sequence, an aspect of online communication largely ignored in existing work on social support. Seen from this perspective, giving unsolicited advice, although apparently a "mismatch," turns out to be a consequence of the open design of the new user's initial posting. We speculate that such unsolicited advice might function at the ideological level to induct the new user into the mores of the group, not only in the kind of support it countenances giving, but into the very meaning of bipolarity itself. © 2009 The Author(s).

AB  - Fertilizer application in the sowing rows does not necessarily increase crop yields, but it does increase the variability of the soil chemical properties, particularly of the nutrients P and K. This variability is greater in the no-tillage system because there is no homogenization of the soil surface layer. This study evaluated the effect of fertilization strategies on soil chemical properties at distinct soil depths after three and six years from the beginning of the experiment in a Haplohumox under long-term no-tillage. Besides, the variation of these properties considering two methods of soil sampling, with and without inclusion of the seeding row, was evaluated. Ten treatments were applied, nine considering P sources (rock phosphate and triple superphosphate), row preparation equipment (double disc opener and coulter opener), fertilizer placement (in-row and broadcast), time of application (summer and winter) and one control treatment, without fertilizer. The measured soil chemical properties were higher in the surface layers and depth distribution, except for P, was not influenced by the fertilization strategies. The soil P values were the lowest in the 0-5 cm layer where the coulter opener equipment had been continuously used for more than three years and no fertilizer was applied. With the inclusion of the sowing row in the soil sampling, higher K, Ca and CEC values were observed. The methodologies of soil sampling, with and without the inclusion of the sowing row and the 0-10 and 0-20 cm sampling layers resulted in similar fertilizer and lime recommendations for areas under long-term no-tillage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Good practice guidelines state that a psychological intervention should usually precede pharmacotherapy, but there are no data evaluating the feasibility of psychological interventions used in this way. METHODS: At the first stage of a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial, 318 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) with clinically significant agitated behavior were treated in an open design with a psychological intervention (brief psychosocial therapy [BPST]) for 4 weeks, preceding randomization to pharmacotherapy. The therapy involved social interaction, personalized music, or removal of environmental triggers. RESULTS: Overall, 318 patients with AD completed BPST with an improvement of 5.6 points on the total Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI; mean [SD], 63.3 [16.0] to 57.7 [18.4], t = 4.8, df = 317, p < 0.0001). Therapy worksheets were completed in six of the eight centers, with the key elements of the intervention delivered according to the manual for >95% of patients. More detailed evaluation of outcome was completed for the 198 patients with AD from these centers, who experienced a mean improvement of 6.6 points on the total CMAI (mean [SD], 62.2 [14.3] to 55.6 [15.8], t = 6.5, df = 197, p < 0.0001). Overall, 43% of participants achieved a 30% improvement in their level of agitation. CONCLUSION: The specific attributable benefits of BPST cannot be determined from an open trial. However, the BPST therapy was feasible and was successfully delivered according to an operationalized manual. The encouraging outcome indicates the need for a randomized controlled trial of BPST.

AB  - Mobility management is vital for realizing large-scale wireless mesh networks to provide cost-effective broadband Internet access. Although a considerable amount of research on mobility management for cellular, Mobile IP, and mobile ad hoc networks has been proposed, mobility management for IP-based hybrid WMNs, including the mobility support from both the network and link layers, remains largely unexplored. Traditional mobility management mechanisms, when applied to hybrid WMNs, may cause significant performance degradation because of the overlooking of key features of WMNs. Challenges arising from multihop wireless communications require the design of new mobility management techniques in WMNs. In this article, mobility management in IP-based hybrid WMNs is investigated. The motivation for mobility management in WMNs is explained, and the existing work is surveyed. To address the new challenges, various open design issues also are presented. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - A mechanical device, the "canopy opener," is being designed to bend tops of soybean plants, creating a pathway for sprayed pest control agents into the lower crop canopy. Mathematical models were developed to aid opener design and placement to maximize spray penetration and coverage with minimum crop damage. The models established relationships among plant deflection, opener depth inside the canopy, and plant height, enabling determination of opening width based on calculations of plant-recovery motion after release from the opener and time available for droplet travel from the nozzle to the lower canopy. To provide parameters to support the developed model, natural frequencies and damping coefficients of soybean plants were determined experimentally. Additionally, times required for droplet travel from specific nozzles to the lower canopy were determined using a laser velocimetry system. The models predicted that for XR8004 nozzles at 276 kPa the maximal opener depth would be 0.14 m and the opener width should range from 0.04 to 0.47 m for 1.06 m tall soybean plants. Experimental measurement of maximal deflection and plant motion agreed with mathematical models.

AB  - Conventional boom sprayers usually are not effective in delivering droplets to inner parts of dense target canopies, such as soybeans at growth stages from R3 to R5. An experimental mechanical canopy opener was developed with the assistance of mathematical models and attached to a conventional boom sprayer to increase spray deposition and coverage inside soybean canopies. The opener consisted of a 2.5 cm diameter metal pipe to push canopies forward, and a frame for connecting the pipe to the spray boom. Field experiments were conducted to determine the amount of spray deposition and percentage of spray coverage on artificial targets at the middle and lower portions of soybean canopies with three opener depths (7.5, 15, and 22.5 cm), three opener widths (15, 25, and 35 cm), and two different sizes of flat-fan nozzles. Additional field experiments were conducted to compare spray deposition and coverage inside soybean canopies among treatments using an air-assisted sprayer, the conventional boom sprayer with the opener, and the boom sprayer with a conventional flat-fan nozzle and a dual-pattern nozzle assembly without the opener. At the time of experiments, the soybean plants were at R5 growth stage with an average height of 1.06 m. An opener width of 25 cm or larger significantly increased the spray deposition and coverage inside the canopies. An opener depth from 7.5 to 15 cm had better spray coverage than the 22.5 cm opener depth. The boom sprayer with the opener produced no significant difference in spray deposition and coverage at the middle of canopies compared to the air-assisted sprayer, but it did produce significantly lower spray deposition and coverage at the lower portions of canopies than the air-assisted sprayer. With assistance from the opener to push the top of canopies, spray deposition and coverage on targets inside soybean canopies by the boom sprayer was improved. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Simultaneous recording of electrophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique of growing importance in neuroscience. Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI featuring low-noise (<0.6 μV p-p input noise), electromagnetic compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7 T), and user-programmable real-time signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7 T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3 T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.

AB  - In this paper we describe a localization and local communication system which allows situated agents to communicate locally, obtaining at the same time both the range and the bearing of the emitter without the need of any centralized control or any external reference. The system relies on infrared communications with frequency modulation and is composed of two interconnected modules for data and power measurement. Thanks to the open hardware license under which it is released, the research community can easily replicate the system at a low cost and/or adapt it for applications in sensor networks and in robotics. © 2008 by the authors.

AB  - Methods to determine cytokine protein content in samples of interest, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are often labor-intensive and costly. Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 200® platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a single sample. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The bipolar plate/current collector plays an important role in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). A current collector with different geometries could have a significant influence on cell performance. This paper presents fractal geometry application to current collector design in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). This new current collector design is named CCFG (Current Collectors with Fractal Geometry). This research determined how to make a better free open design for the current collector on a printed circuit board based DMFC. The results show that both the free area ratio and total holes perimeter length on the bipolar plate affect the cell performance. The total number of holes on the perimeter presents greater effects than the free open ratio. The cell performance is more sensitive using a cathode current collector than the anode current collector. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the complexity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels, direct measurement is the main viable option for accurate characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are presented, which was mainly constructed from conventional instruments and components. This switched architecture system is similar to commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US$ 50000). The sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers, which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this "open-hardware"project, the hardware design and software components are openly available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the MIMO measurement capability. The actual systems built at the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, and Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, are presented, as are some example studies. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This paper deals with the development of an open design platform for explorative cell mechanotransduction investigation. The produced setup combines scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques and advanced robotics approaches, allowing both prolonged observations and spatial measurements on biological samples. As a result, an enhanced force probing method based on scanning microscopy techniques and advanced robotics and automation approaches is integrated in this device. Visual and force feedback control is used to achieve automatic data acquisition and monitoring processes when high skills are required. Experimentation on the mechanical cell characterization under in vitro conditions on human adherent cervix epithelial Hela cells are presented to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed setup. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Pregabalin is a new anxiolytic that selectively binds to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, inhibiting release of excessive levels of excitatory neurotransmitters. In this open-label trial we aimed to investigate the efficacy of pregabalin on alcoholism indices in detoxified alcohol-dependent subjects. Reduction of cravings, psychiatric symptom improvements, and the evaluation of safety parameters were the secondary endpoints. Methods: Thirty-one alcohol-dependent patients were consecutively recruited and screened for the study. Twenty detoxified patients received pregabalin starting at 50 mg/day (orally) in the first week, gradually increasing to a flexible dose of 150-450 mg/day. Subjects were assessed at the beginning of the treatment, and after 2, 8 and 16 weeks. Craving (visual analogue scale, Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale [OCDS]) and withdrawal (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol [CIWA-Ar]) rating scales were applied; psychiatric symptoms were evaluated through the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Results: Out of the twenty patients who received the study drug, 15 completed the study procedures: 10 remained totally alcohol-free for the duration of the study, five relapsed. An additional four patients dropped out during the study, and one stopped taking medication due to adverse events. A significant progressive reduction of both craving and withdrawal symptomatology were observed. Safety parameters did not show any significant variation during treatment. Conclusion: Pregabalin shows promise as a treatment for alcohol dependence. Although limited by a low number of participants and by the open design, this is the first study concerning the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in current alcoholics. In these patients pregabalin was effective and well tolerated. Additional research is needed to explore the clinical relevance of these findings. © Springer Healthcare Communications 2008.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the image quality of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the carotid artery with open 0.35-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared to a 1.5-T high-field system. Patients and Methods: 100 patients were retrospectively evaluated with CE-MRA for suspected carotid or vertebral artery disease. 50 patients were investigated using an open-design 0.35-T MRI system, 50 were examined on a 1.5-T closed-bore magnet system. Maximum intensity (MIP) and volume-rendering technique (VRT) reconstructions were performed. Image quality was assessed using a four-point ranking score (1 = excellent, 4 = not evaluable). Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was measured. The data were analyzed using Wilcoxon's test (score data) and Student's t-test (S/N ratio). Significance levels were set at p < 0.05. Results: For 1.5-T imaging, average image quality using VRT for the common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery (ECA), and vertebral arteries (VAs) was 1.68, 1.14, 1.21, and 1.54, respectively. For MIP imaging, average image quality for the CCA, ICA, ECA, and VA was 1.44, 1.16, 1.22, and 1.22, respectively. For 0.35-T imaging, average image quality using VRT for the CCA, ICA, ECA, and VA was 1.46, 1.44, 1.90, and 2.02, respectively. For MIP imaging, average image quality for the CCA, ICA, ECA, and VA was 1.76, 1.80, 2.31, and 2.18, respectively. Quality differed significantly between 1.5 and 0.35 T, except for the CCA. There was no significant quality difference for the CCA between 0.35 T and 1.5 T using MIP or VRT reconstruction. There was no significant difference for the S/N ratio (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The 1.5-T system showed significantly or highly significantly better image quality scores, compared to the 0.35-T system. Nevertheless, image quality was rated satisfactory also using 0.35 T field strength. © 2008 Urban & Vogel.

AB  - A simple digital receiver named "GNU Radio Beacon Receiver (GRBR)" was developed for the satelliteground beacon experiment to measure the ionospheric total electron content (TEC). The open-source software toolkit for the software defined radio, GNU Radio, is utilized to realize the basic function of the receiver and perform fast signal processing. The software is written in Python for a LINUX PC. The open-source hardware called Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), which best matches the GNU Radio, is used as a frontend to acquire the satellite beacon signals of 150 and 400 MHz. The first experiment was successful as results from GRBR showed very good agreement to those from the co-located analog beacon receiver.

AB  - The current automotive electrical/electronic (E/E) systems are characterized by proprietary solutions, which seldom allow the exchange of applications between both automotive OEMs and their suppliers. It is especially difficult to change ECU suppliers or reuse the software in a new generation of products. Increasing functional requirements in automotive E/E vehicle development will significantly enhance the integration of novel functions. In order to satisfy the increasing requirements for the complex software development of automotive E/E system, implement the portability of application software modules and compatibility of ECU modules among different automotive OEMs and their suppliers, this paper presents an open design methodology based on quantum platform. An open architecture of automotive E/E system based quantum platform is established. Its principle and structures are described in detail. Finally, an automated mechanical transmission (AMT) system as a typical case is used to demonstrate the design process based on the proposed method. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conceptual studies and numerical simulations are performed for imaging devices that transform a near-field pattern into magnified far-zone images and are based on high-order spatial transformation in cylindrical domains. A lens translating a near-field pattern from an almost circular input boundary onto a magnified far-field image at a flat output boundary is considered. The lens is made of a metamaterial with anisotropic permittivity and permeability both depending on a single "scaling" parameter of the transformation. Open designs of the lens with a truncated body (3/4-body and 1/4-body lenses) are suggested and analyzed. It is shown that the ideal full lens and the 3/4-body lens produce identical images. Numerical simulations of 1/4-body designs indicate that further truncation of the lens could limit its performance. A light concentrator "focusing" far-zone fields into a nanometer-scale area is also considered. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is often described as the ability to recognize and exploit opportunities. Identifying opportunities is intentional and idiosyncratic insofar as they are recognized as opportunities is a novel and conscious event (otherwise the entrepreneur would be doing nothing new). Yet opportunities also have to be recognized by others as ones that are worthy of being recognized and pursued; the opportunity is a socially embedded construct. Thus opportunity recognition and pursuit can be understood as the skillful integration of prevailing and emerging objects and relations of business activity typically articulated through collaborative enterprise. To expand on this view I use an activity theory perspective that shows how the potentially transformative character of entrepreneurial opportunities unfurls from within the historical and cultural reproduction of collective activities. I note, however, different emphases within current takes on activity theory, notably between subjective perspectives and open-design perspectives. In discussing these theoretical differences using existing entrepreneurial studies, as well as selected data from a study of 90 entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom, I suggest a possible reconciliation. I conclude by suggesting that where activity theory promotes a rich and nuanced understanding of the socially embedded nature of entrepreneurial opportunities, entrepreneurial studies can also contribute to a nuanced development of activity theory insofar as the entrepreneurial object of activity (opportunity recognition and its pursuit through creating a business) has what I identify as an aesthetic as well as pragmatic logic.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of different commercially available biomonitors for the validation of chemo-thermal disinfecting washing procedures in textile service enterprises. In the course of quality management systems (e.g. ace. to EN 14065: Risk Analysis and Bio-contamination Control System, RABC-System) the performance of disinfecting washing procedures has to be controlled and validated periodically by the use of biomonitors. Biomonitors (typically small cotton fabrics) are loaded with bacteria and often encapsulated in semipermeable membranes. The following types of biomonitors are commercially available: a) "open design", fabrics soaked with blood and bacteria enclosed in textile bags, b) monitors with bacteria enclosed in a semipermeable membrane and c) monitors surrounded by a semipermeable membrane and covered with a hard plastic surface. The membranes should avoid bacterial contamination of the textiles and environment because bacteria are too large to pass the membrane. It is commonly accepted in practice that liquids, proteins and disinfecting agents can diffuse through the membrane. However, big differences in the germ reductions measured with different biomonitors were detected, depending on their individual design. Therefore the diffusion properties of several detergent ingredients were quantified by using semipermeable membranes. It is demonstrated that proteins and even active oxygen species, are retained by these membranes and are thus not able to kill or inactivate bacteria inside the monitors. Hence the use of biomonitors with membranes should be reconsidered, because they are mainly able to detect thermal disinfection, but barely react to the chemical part of chemo-thermal disinfection procedures.

AB  - Background: Two single case studies suggest that a protein-rich diet may be beneficial for patients with McArdle disease, based on improvements in either endurance or muscle energetics, as assessed by phosphorous MR spectroscopy. In healthy subjects, proteins contribute very little to energy metabolism during exercise, which questions the effect of protein in McArdle disease. Methods: In a crossover, open design, we studied seven patients with McArdle disease, who were randomised to follow either a carbohydrate- or protein-rich diet for 3 days before testing. Calorific intake on each diet was identical, and was adjusted to the subject's weight, age and sex. After each diet, exercise tolerance and maximal work capacity were tested on a bicycle ergometer, using a constant workload for 15 minutes followed by an incremental workload to exhaustion. Results: During the constant workload, heart rate and perceived exertion were consistently lower (p<0.0005) on the carbohydrate- versus protein-rich diet. Patients also had a 25% improvement in maximal oxidative work capacity on the carbohydrate versus the protein diet. Conclusions: This study shows that patients with McArdle disease can improve their maximal work capacity and exercise tolerance to submaximal workloads by maintaining a diet high in carbohydrate instead of protein. The carbohydrate diet not only improves tolerance to everyday activities, but will probably also help to prevent exercise-induced episodes of muscle injury in McArdle disease.

AB  - Background: Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder. Although prevention is the mainstream treatment, some patients are refractory to standard therapies. Aim: To evaluate the use of quetiapine (QTP) in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine, defined as previous unresponsiveness to the combination atenolol + nortriptyline + flunarizine. Method: Thirty-four consecutive patients (30 women and 4 men) with migraine (ICHD-II) and headache attacks on less than 15 days per month not overusing symptomatic medications were studied. The main inclusion criterion was the lack of response (<50% reduction in attack frequency) after ten weeks to the combination of atenolol (60 mg/day) + nortriptyline (25 mg/day) + flunarizine (3 mg/day). The patients started on QTP as the sole treatment in a single daily dose of 25 mg, titrated to 75 mg. After ten weeks, headache frequency, consumption of rescue medications and adverse events were analyzed. Results: Twenty nine patients completed the study. Among completers, 22 (75.9%; 64.7% of the intention-to-treat population) presented >50% headache reduction. The mean frequency of migraine days decreased from 10.2 to 6.2 and the average consumption of rescue medications decreased from 2.3 to 1.2 days/week. Adverse events were reported by 9 (31%) patients. Conclusion: Although limited by the open design, this study provides a pilot data to support the use of quetiapine in preventive treatment of refractory migraine.

AB  - Background: Prebiotic and probiotic therapies are new strategies that are being used to treat different gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Aims: Evaluating the effects of a symbiotic preparation on symptoms and colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and significant bloating. Methods: We carried out an open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter trial on 129 patients meeting Rome II criteria for irritable bowel syndrome who did not have lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse. For three months, the patients were treated with a symbiotic preparation and were investigated trough questionnaires on symptoms. Data on bloating and abdominal pain were obtained using the McNemar-Bowker's test, while data on stool frequency were evaluated using the t-test. Results: The administration of a symbiotic preparation to these patients modified the clinical picture and intestinal function, with a significant increase of stool frequency. Conclusions: Our data, although the study had an open design, represent a further analysis of positive symbiotic effects on clinical manifestations and intestinal function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. © Mattioli 1885.

AB  - IP-PBXs work with VoIP telephones to connect a number of private extensions through lines to the public phone system, routing outbound, and incoming calls and providing features such as voice services on an IP based data network and teleconferencing. IP-PBXs can also mix IP and traditional telephony, as in trunking a call from an analog phone over the Internet and routing an incoming analog call from the PSTN to a VoIP telephone. An extremely low cost yet powerful IP-PBX reference design can be developed and put into production by the combination of the Analog Devices Blackfin, which is an open hardware, to Asterisk, Oslec, and uClinux. The IP04 is such an open hardware IP-PBX design that uses a four port IP-PBX running Asterisk and uClinux on a Blackfin processor. The Blackfin boot ROM starts reading from the 256-kbit SPI flash chip, when power is applied. IP04 requires a lot of flash storage to store the Asterisk executable and audio prompts in comparison to embedded Linux systems.

AB  - Background: Studies suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) participates in neural circuitry that is dysregulated in Panic Disorder (PD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We tested whether low-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) could normalize the overactivity of right frontal regions and thereby improve symptoms. Methods: Six patients with PD and comorbid MDD were treated with daily active 1-Hz rTMS to the right DLPFC for 2 weeks in this open-label trial. Results: Clinical improvements were apparent as early as the first week of treatment. After the second week, 5/6 of patients showed improvements in panic and anxiety, and 4/6 showed a decrease in depression, with sustained improvement at 6 months of follow-up. Right hemisphere resting motor threshold increased significantly after rTMS. Limitations: Limitations of this study are the open design and the small sample size. Conclusions: Slow rTMS to the right DLPFC resulted in significant clinical improvement and reduction of ipsilateral motor cortex excitability. Replications in larger sample will help to clarify the relevance of this preliminary data and to define the potential role of right DLPFC rTMS in panic with major depression. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way? The international Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM) is an open design challenge for student teams that addresses this difficult question. Using a library of standardised parts known as BioBricks, groups of undergraduates from around the world spend their summer designing and assembling biological devices, to build genetic machines. © 2007 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the tolerance of MR examinations in children and adolescents performed in a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with an expanded bore diameter. Method and Materials: 163 patients, ages 4 to 25, underwent MR examinations in a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with an open design (MAGNETOM Espree, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), characterized by a compact length of 125 cm and an expanded 70 cm bore diameter. MR imaging of the brain was carried out in most cases (78.5%), followed by examinations of the spinal canal (9.8%), the extremities (9.2%) and the neck (2.5%). The patients were divided into four age groups and the success rate, motion artifacts and diagnostic quality of the MR examinations were assessed using a 3-grade scale. Results: In 119 of 163 patients (73.0%), MR examination was possible without any motion artifacts. With respect to the different age groups, 41.7% of the 4-7-year-old children, 67.6% of the 8-10-year-old children, 84.1% of the 11-16-year-old children and 95.8% of the patients older than 17 showed tolerance grade I without motion artifacts and excellent diagnostic image quality. In 39 of 163 children (23.9%), the MR images showed moderate motion artifacts but had sufficient diagnostic quality. With regard to the different age groups, 52.8% of the 4-7-year-old children, 26.5% of the 8-10-year-old children, 15.9% of the 11-16-year-old children and none of the patients older than 17 showed tolerance grade II with moderate motion artifacts and sufficient diagnostic image quality. In only 4 of 124 children < 10 years old and 1 child > 10 years old, the MR examination was not feasible and had to be repeated under sedation. Conclusion: Pediatric MR imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with an open design can be conducted in children and adolescents with excellent acceptance. The failure rate of 3.0% of cases for pediatric MR imaging is comparable to that of a conventional low-field open MR scanner. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - PURPOSE. To test the hypothesis that human choroidal blood flow (ChBF) may depend, not only on ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), but also on absolute mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intraocular pressure (IOP). METHODS. There were two study days in an open design. On the first day, OPP was varied by elevating IOP during a squatting-induced increase in MAP (28 subjects). On the second day, only the IOP was increased (17 subjects). IOP was raised in stepwise increments by using the suction cup method. Subfoveal ChBF (laser Doppler flowmetry), MAP, and IOP were assessed, and OPP was calculated as 2/3(MAP - IOP). For correlation analysis, data from all subjects were pooled according to IOP and MAP, and correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS. When data from study day 1 were grouped according to IOP, no correlation was observed between ChBF and MAP; but ChBFs were lower, the higher the IOP (P < 0.001). When data were grouped according to MAP, a significant correlation was found between ChBF and IOP (P < 0.001), but correlations were independent of MAP. When data of study day 2 were pooled according to IOP, a correlation between ChBF and OPP was seen only at IOP > 40 mm Hg (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. The data confirm previously published observations that the choroid shows some autoregulatory capacity during changes in OPP. In addition, the data indicate that the choroid regulates its blood flow better during exercise-induced changes in MAP than during an experimental increase in IOP.

AB  - Yomeishu® (YMS) is one of the traditional medicinal tonic liqueur in Japan, containing 14 kinds of herbal drugs such as Cinnamomi Cortex, Paeoniae radix, Ginseng radix, Eucommiae Cortex, Cistanchis Herba and so on. The effects of YMS on sensation of cold syndrome and external temperature of insteps as peripheral body temperature were studied in 8 women. YMS was taken for 2 months continuously. The sensation of cold syndrome was partially improved by continuous taking of YMS. The external temperature of insteps before and after cold water immersion were increased by continuous taking of YMS. These results suggest that continuous taking of YMS is effective for sensitive women to the cold.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown that 4% of hospitalized patients suffer from an adverse event caused by the medical treatment administered. Some institutions have created systems to encourage medical workers to report these adverse events. However, these systems often prove to be inadequate and/or ineffective for reviewing the data collected and improving the outcomes in patient safety. Objective: To describe the Web-application Duke Surgery Patient Safety, designed for the anonymous reporting of adverse and near-miss events as well as scheduled reporting to surgeons and hospital administration. Software architecture: DSPS was developed primarily using Java language running on a Tomcat server and with MySQL database as its backend. Results: Formal and field usability tests were used to aid in development of DSPS. Extensive experience with DSPS at our institution indicate that DSPS is easy to learn and use, has good speed, provides needed functionality, and is well received by both adverse-event reporters and administrators. Discussion: This is the first description of an open-source application for reporting patient safety, which allows the distribution of the application to other institutions in addition for its ability to adapt to the needs of different departments. DSPS provides a mechanism for anonymous reporting of adverse events and helps to administer Patient Safety initiatives. Conclusion: The modifiable framework of DSPS allows adherence to evolving national data standards. The open-source design of DSPS permits surgical departments with existing reporting mechanisms to integrate them with DSPS. The DSPS application is distributed under the GNU General Public License. © 2007 Pietrobon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 0.35 T magnetic resonance system with open design. METHODS: Eleven patients were examined in an open MRI system with a field strength of 0.35 T. Myocardial function was assessed with cine true fast imaging with steady-state precession sequences in 2 planes. Perfusion images were acquired with a T1-weighted gradient echo sequence. Late enhancement was performed using an inversion recovery-prepared fast gradient echo technique. Image quality was assessed using a 4-point score in consensus. Signal-noise ratio was measured. RESULTS: For functional imaging, average score was 1.65 (SD, 0.6). For perfusion imaging, the value was 2.25 (SD, 0.68). For late enhancement, quality score was 2.6 (SD, 0.82). Average value of signal-noise ratio for functional, perfusion, and late enhancement imaging was 50.6 (SD, 16.4), 91.8 (SD, 52.8), and 33.2 (SD, 20.4), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Open MRI with lower field strength can be used for functional imaging of the heart. For perfusion and viability imaging (late enhancement), higher field strength is needed. Open low-field cardiac MRI may provide a helpful alternative for obese or claustrophobic patients or patients who are difficult to move. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of milnacipran in the acute treatment of patients with panic disorder. Thirty-one patients who met Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-IV criteria for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were included in the study. Patients were initially treated with milnacipran 25 mg twice daily and then 50 mg twice daily until the 10th week. The treatment outcome and panic disorder severity were determined by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Panic Inventory, Clinical Global Impression and Hamilton Anxiety Scale, all of which were applied during every evaluation interview. Quality of life (WHOQOL-bref) was evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study. Missing data were handled by using the last observation carried forward for all participants who had taken at least one dose of study medication. Intention-to-treat was used in the analyses. Pharmacological treatment resulted in a clinically and statistically significant mean reduction in all severity measures. Remission (Clinical Global Impression≤2) was obtained in 58.1% of the sample. Regarding WHOQOL, we found a significant improvement (P<0.05) across treatment in all the domains studied. Although results may be influenced by the open design of this pilot study and by the small sample size, our findings suggest that milnacipran may be effective for the treatment of panic disorder and justify further research. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of clozapine on plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels in schizophrenic patients and to compare their results with those of unmedicated healthy controls. Groups of 20 outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls matched for age, sex and smoking status were recruited for the study. Psychopathology, neurocognitive functioning, plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin and MAO levels were assessed after 1-week drug free interval, and 8 weeks after initiation of clozapine treatment in an open design. The mean clozapine dose at week 8 was 382.5 ± 96.4 (range: 250-600) mg/day. In the patient group, at baseline, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels were significantly lower, and platelet serotonin levels were significantly higher than in controls. After 8 weeks of clozapine treatment, plasma serotonin and platelet MAO levels increased significantly, while a significant decrease in platelet serotonin levels was detected compared with baseline values. Baseline platelet MAO levels explained 22% of the variance in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and improvement in attention, while baseline platelet serotonin predicted 23% of the variance in the improvement in positive symptoms during clozapine treatment. Our data indicate that clozapine may be reversing or compensating for a pre-existing alteration in serotonergic neurotransmission in schizophrenic patients. The prediction of response to clozapine through peripheral biochemical markers may have important clinical implications if repeated in larger samples. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Organic materials offer new electronic functionality not available in inorganic devices. However, the integration of organic compounds within nanoscale electronic circuitry poses new challenges for materials physics and chemistry. Typically, the electronic states in organic materials are energetically misaligned with the Fermi level of metal contacts. Here, we study the voltage-induced change in conductivity in nanoscale devices comprising a monolayer of polyelectrolyte macromolecules. The devices are fabricated using integrated shadow masks. Reversible switching is observed between conducting (ON) and non-conducting (OFF) states in the devices. The open design of our devices easily permits chemical modification of the polyelectrolyte, which we show has a pronounced effect on the ON-OFF switching. We suggest that the switching voltage ionizes the polymers, creating a conducting channel of electronic levels aligned with the contact Fermi level. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Objective: In spite of introduction of novel drugs, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) has still found no suitable treatment. On the other hand, high rates of co-morbidity of OCD with bipolar spectrum disorders are increasingly recognized. Mood switching and development of rapid cycling with antidepressants are significant problems in these patients. From this viewpoint, introducing a non-antidepressant anti-OCD drug has great theoretical and clinical importance. In this open-label clinical trial we evaluated the effects of naltrexone on OCD symptoms. Method: In this study, 23 OCD outpatients treated with a fixed dose of clomipramie, fluoxetine, or both, for at least 3 months before trial underwent treatment with naltrexone, 25 to 100 milligrams a day as adjunctive treatment. Change in symptoms was evaluated by Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Persian version, administered at baseline and at the end of the 2 months trial. Results: Seven patients dropped out of the study before the end of the 2 months: 4 patients for non-response and 3 patients for intolerable side effects. Sixteen patients, 9 females and 7 males, completed the study. The most frequent co-morbid disorders found in these patients were bipolar spectrum disorders (68.7%). Non-parametric (Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test) and parametric (paired t-test) analyses both showed significant reductions in YBOCS ratings after naltrexone treatment (P<0.001). Two patients remained symptom free over 6 months after discontinuation of all medications. Conclusion: Although small sample size and open design of the trial make the results tentative, it appears that naltrexone may be effective on at least certain subgroups of OCD patients, especially those with both OCD and bipolar spectrum disorders. Long-term effects of the drug after discontinuation should be addressed in future double-blind studies.

AB  - Context: Pegvisomant is a specific GH receptor antagonist that is able to normalize serum IGF-I concentrations in most patients with acromegaly. The impact of pegvisomant on insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism is less well described. Patients and Methods: We assessed basal and insulin-stimulated (euglycemic clamp) substrate metabolism in seven patients with active acromegaly before and after 4-wk pegvisomant treatment (15 mg/d) in an open design. Results: After pegvisomant, IGF-I decreased, whereas GH increased (IGF-I, 621 ± 82 vs. 247 ± 33 μg/liter, P = 0.02; GH, 5.3 ± 1.5 vs. 10.8 ± 3.3 μg/liter, P = 0.02). Basal serum insulin and plasma glucose levels decreased after treatment (insulin, 54 ± 5.9 vs. 42 ± 5.3 pmol/liter, P = 0.001; glucose, 5.7 ± 0.1 vs. 5.3 ± 0.0 mmol/liter, not significant), whereas palmitate kinetics were unaltered. During the clamp, the glucose infusion rate increased after pegvisomant (3.1 ± 0.5 vs. 4.4 ± 0.6 mg/kg·min, P = 0.02), whereas the suppression of endogenous glucose production tended to increase (0.7 ± 0.0 vs. 0.5 ± 0.1 mg/kg·min, not significant). Total resting energy expenditure decreased after pegvisomant treatment (1703 ± 109 vs. 1563 ± 101 kcal/24 h, P = 0.03), but the rate of lipid oxidation did not change significantly. Conclusions: 1) Pegvisomant treatment for 4 wk improves peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity in acromegaly. 2) This is associated with a decrease in resting energy expenditure, whereas free fatty acid metabolism is unaltered. 3) The data support the important direct effects of GH on glucose metabolism and add additional benefits to pegvisomant treatment for acromegaly.

AB  - PURPOSE. To determine how severe peripheral field loss (PFL) affects the dispersion of eye movements relative to the head in patients walking in real environments. This information should help to define the visual field and clearance requirements for head-mounted mobility visual aids. METHODS. Eye positions relative to the head were recorded in five patients with retinitis pigmentosa who had less than 15° of visual field and in three normally sighted people, each walking in varied environments for more than 30 minutes. The eye-position recorder was made portable by modifying a head-mounted system (ISCAN, Burlington, MA). Custom data processing was implemented, to reject unreliable data. Sample standard deviations of eye position (dispersion) were compared across subject groups and environments. RESULTS. The patients with PFL exhibited narrower horizontal eye-position dispersions than did the normally sighted subjects (9.4° vs. 14.2°, P < 0.0001), and the vertical dispersions of patients with PFL were smaller when they were walking indoors than when walking outdoors (8.2° vs. 10.3°; P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS. When walking, the patients with PFL did not increase their scanning eye movements to compensate for missing peripheral vision information. Their horizontal scanning was actually reduced, possibly because of lack of peripheral stimulation. The results suggest that a field of view as wide as 40° may be needed for closed (immersive) head-mounted mobility aids, whereas a much narrower display, perhaps as narrow as 20°, may be sufficient with an open design.

AB  - Background: The source of conspecific heart transplantation organ is very limited and deficiency becomes more and more obvious. Objective: To observe the mechanical properties of ascending aorta at one-dimensional loading between healthy persons and swine of different months, so as to provide necessary biomechanical experimental basis for anastomosing blood vessel in heterogeneic heart transplantation from swine to human. Design: Open design Setting: Staff Room of Anatomy, Yunyang Medical College Materials: This experiment was carried out at the Laboratory of Biomechanics, Yunyang Medical College from April 2002 to July 2003. Ascending aortas of human were obtained from the 6 adult male corpses without cardiovascular diseases, aged 18 to 30 years, who died for accident and donated by Yunyang Medical College. Totally 42 conspecific swine of 1 month old, with certification number of QN0202, were provided by Animal Experimental Center of Yunyang Medical College. They were raised with common foodstuff. The 42 swine were butchered respectively at 1,2,3, 4,5,6 and 7 months, 6 swine once. After anatomical isolation and in situ measurement of respective in vivo length, ascending aorta from aorta valve ring base plane to initiation part of innominate artery was taken out (Artherosclerosis was not presented in all the samples) and divided into five equal segments, and the second and fourth segments were used for mechanical test of one-dimensional loading. Methods: Six adult male corpses and ascending aorta of 42 swine of 1 to 7 months were performed mechanical test of one-dimensional loading. All the blood segments were pre-treated ten times with the same strain rate at room temperature 32 °C (loading range from 0 to 0.5 N). Hysteresis disappeared after blood vessel was given periodic permanent loading and unloading, and repeated force-deformed data were obtained. Blood vessel was given loading and unloading once with the same loading range and strain rate. The recorded force-deformed data were used for computer analysis. Force and displacement were scaled with standard weight and percentage scale at the end of each time. Constant α and elastic modulus dT/dλ were fitted from experimental data. Main outcome measures: 1 Comparison of the mechanical characteristic constant of ascending aorta at one-dimensional loading between human and swine of different months. 2 Comparison of elastic modulus of ascending aorta at one -dimensional loading between human and swine of different months. Results: 1 Comparison of the mechanical characteristic constant of ascending aorta at one-dimensional loading between human and swine of different months: With the increase of month, although the material constant of blood vessel of swine had a little increase, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The mechanical material constant of ascending aorta at one-dimensional loading of human was basically familiar to that of swine of 1 to 7 months (P > 0.05). 2 Comparison of elastic modulus of ascending aorta at one -dimensional loading between human and swine of different months: With the increase of months, elastic modulus of ascending aorta was significantly increased in swine of 7 months old in comparison with that in other months old (P < 0.05); there was no significant difference of elastic modulus of corresponding blood vessel between human and swine of different months (P > 0.05). Conclusion: There is no significant difference in mechanical characteristic constant and elastic modulus of ascending aorta between human and swine of 1 to 7 months. Mechanical characteristics of corresponding blood vessel were similar in some segments at least. From the mechanical angle, anastomosis of corresponding ascending aorta in the process of heterogeneic heart transplantation from swine to human has certain feasibility.

AB  - We discuss a low-cost atomic force microscope that we have designed and built for use in an undergraduate teaching laboratory. This microscope gives students hands-on access to nano-Newton force measurements and subangstrom position measurements. The apparatus relies mainly on off-the-shelf components and utilizes an interferometric position sensor known as the interdigitated (ID) cantilever to obtain high resolution. The mechanical properties of the ID readout enable a robust and open design that makes it possible for students to directly control it. Its pedagogical advantage is that students interact with a complete instrument system and learn measurement principles in context. One undergraduate experiment enabled by this apparatus is a measurement of Boltzmann's constant, which is done by recording the thermal noise power spectrum of a microfabricated cantilever beam. In addition to gaining an appreciation of the lower limits of position and force measurements, students learn to apply numerous concepts such as digital sampling, Fourier-domain analysis, noise sources, and error propagation. © 2006 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - Location-based services turned out not to be the "next big thing" following the success stories of GSM and SMS. The reasons for this are manifold and range from inaccurate cellular positioning technologies to a lack of competition in this field, both being closely related to the fact that positioning is controlled by a network-centric approach where the mobile network operator has the unique selling point for making position data available to third parties. However, things change: small, low-cost GPS receivers, either attachable to mobile devices or even integrated, are enjoying great popularity since their recent inception and are expected to become a standard feature of cell phones in the near future. In conjunction with mobile packet data services, they provide a basis for device-centric LBS platforms, where position data can be obtained directly from the mobile device. In this article the device-centric LBS middleware TraX, which focuses particularly on position management, advanced functions for interrelating the position data of several targets, and privacy protection, is presented. Due to its generic and open design, TraX can be reused for a broad range of different LBSs and thus fosters service diversity and multiprovider environments, both of which are essential for making the next generation of LBSs a success. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Measurement of locomotor activity is a valuable tool for analysing factors influencing behaviour and for investigating brain function. Several methods have been described in the literature for measuring the amount of animal movement but most are flawed or expensive. Here, we describe an open source, modular, low-cost, user-friendiy, highly sensitive, non-invasive system that records all the movements of a rat in its cage. Methods: Our activity monitoring system quantifies overall free movements of rodents without any markers, using a commercially available CCTV and a newly designed motion detection software developed on a GNU/Linux-operating computer. The operating principle is that the amount of overall movement of an object can be expressed by the difference in total area occupied by the object in two consecutive picture frames. The application is based on software modules that allow the system to be used in a high-throughput workflow. Documentation, example files, source code and binary files can be freely downloaded from the project website at http://bioinformatics.org/gemvid/. Results: In a series of experiments with objects of pre-defined oscillation frequencies and movements, we documented the sensitivity, reproducibility and stability of our system. We also compared data obtained with our system and data obtained with an Actiwatch device. Finally, to validate the system, results obtained from the automated observation of 6 rats during 7 days in a regular light cycle are presented and are accompanied by a stability test. The validity of this system is further demonstrated through the observation of 2 rats in constant dark conditions that displayed the expected free running of their circadian rhythm. Conclusion: The present study describes a system that relies on video frame differences to automatically quantify overall free movements of a rodent without any markers. It allows the monitoring of rats in their own environment for an extended period of time. By using a low-cost, open source hardware/software solution, laboratories can greatly simplify their data acquisition and analysis pipelines and improve their workload. © 2006 Poirrier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A de facto standard such as DWG or PDF (Portable Document Format) to AEC, becomes a standard design by broad grass roots adoption and recognition throughout an industry. DWG is the format for Autodesk's AutoCAD based products and is used as the primary channel of data design in an extended project lifecycle. Downstream consumers of design data can never be sure if they will actually be able to use the DWG files they are getting. The Open Design Alliance develops software libraries to enable import and export of DWG files, are supported by hundreds of software vendors and used by millions of engineers, designers and architects. PDF is the open file format developed by Adobe systems for describing documents containing any combination of text, graphics and images in a device and resolution-independent format. A growing number of federal and state agencies, institutions and associations, including the FDA and U.S. courts, have mandated PDF-based workflows.

AB  - The main objective of this work was to study the functional markers of the clinical response to cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4). Twelve healthy male subjects were challenged with CCK-4 and simultaneously underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recording. Since anticipatory anxiety (AA) is an intrinsic part of panic disorder, a behavioral paradigm, using the threat of being administered a second injection of CCK-4, has been developed to investigate induced AA. The study was composed of three fMRI scans according to an open design. During first and second scan, subjects were injected with placebo and CCK-4, respectively. The third scan was the AA challenge. CCK-4 administration induced physiological and psychological symptoms of anxiety that met the criteria for a panic attack in 8 subjects, as well as cerebral activation in anxiety-related brain regions. Clinical and physiological response intensity was consistent with cerebral activity extent and robustness. fMRI proved more sensitive than clinical assessment in evidencing the effects of the AA challenge. The latter induced brain activation, different from that obtained on CCK-4 and during placebo injection, that was likely related to anxiety. The method applied in this study is suitable for the study of anxiety using fMRI. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oshima Shipbuilding has launched a 54,000dwt bulk carrier of the Super-Handymax size with a so called semi-open design. The new design has less area than the hold dimensions as hatch openings are adopted at all holds, but with a cross-deck at the fore and aft end of each opening. Oshima has also created some alternative semi-open version of 50,000dwt, 52,000dwt and 54,000dwt, which include hopper-type holds or bench-type bottoms. The additional features of this new semi-open series include improved cargo loading and discharge efficiency, reduced fuel consumption, environment protection, reduced maintenance work, and better operational safety. The vessel also has Oshima's Seaworthy Bow form to improve seakeeping and limit resistance in rough weather conditions.

AB  - Aim: This comparative, open design, phase III study was to assess the non-inferiority of the non-preserved T-Gel 0.1% single dose unit (SDU) versus its preserved multidose (MD) reference. Methods: 175 patients with bilateral POAG or OHT were randomised: 87 patients were to receive one drop daily of T-Gel 0.1% MD and 88 patients were to receive one drop daily of T-Gel 0.1% SDU, for a treatment period of 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change in intraocular pressure (IOP) in the worse eye between the baseline and the last assessment. Subjective and objective ocular signs as well as adverse events were recorded for safety. Global tolerance was assessed by the investigator and by the patient. Results: The mean percentage reduction from baseline IOP was 24% for both treatments groups, which was consistent with previous studies. The safety results were comparable in both treatment groups. Because of gel formulation, mild short lasting episodes of blurred vision occurred for about 20% of patients. The global tolerance assessment reported that both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: The overall study results demonstrated that T-Gel 0.1% SDU is not inferior to T-Gel 0.1% MD.

AB  - Industrialised nations have dedicated significant investments toward the development of civil infrastructure. To preserve this investment, attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil infrastructure applications. © Imperial College Press.

AB  - The architecture and functions of the control system we developed for plate rolling process were introduced according to the characteristics of the process. How the data communication is implemented among the modules used was analyzed in detail. Based on the application in site, a conceptual design was suggested for the system software to constitute a two-level software hierarchy of process control of which the communication is separated from the process model. Such a hierarchy meets all the safe and stable requirement for the operation of the process control system and simplifies the debugging procedure and maintenance for the system. Introducing the expandable open design into the software hierarchy, the adaptability of the control system becomes stronger. Such a hierarchy is adaptable to the development of cooling process control as well.

AB  - This technical note describes a new robotic workstation for neurological rehabilitation, shortly named Braccio di Ferro. It has been designed by having in mind the range of forces and the frequency bandwidth that characterize the interaction between a patient and a physical therapist, as well as a number of requirements that we think are essential for allowing a natural haptic interaction: back-driveability, very low friction and inertia, mechanical robustness, the possibility to operate in different planes, and an open software environment, which allows the operator to add new functionalities and design personalized rehabilitation protocols. Braccio di Ferro is an open system and, in the spirit of open source design, is intended to foster the dissemination of robot therapy. Moreover, its combination of features is not present in commercially available systems. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes a novel emitter tip having the shape of a nib and based on an open structure for nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS). The nib structure is fabricated with standard lithography techniques using SU-8, an epoxy-based negative photoresist. The tip is comprised of a reservoir, a capillary slot and a point-like feature, and is fabricated on a silicon wafer. We present here a novel scheme for interfacing such nib tips to MS by applying the ionization voltage directly onto the semi-conductor support. The silicon support is in direct contact with the liquid to be analyzed at the reservoir and microchannel level, thus allowing easy use in ESI-MS. This scheme is especially advantageous for automated analysis as the manual step of positioning a metallic wire into the reservoir is avoided. In addition, the analysis performance was enhanced compared with the former scheme, as demonstrated by the tests of standard peptides (gramicidin S, Glu-fibrinopeptide B). The limit of detection was determined to be lower than 10-2 μM. Due to their enhanced performance, these microfabricated sources might be of great interest for analysis requiring very high sensitivity, such as proteomics analysis using nanoESI-MS. © 2005 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.

AB  - Complexity demand of modern communication systems, particularly in the wireless domain, grows at an astounding rate, a rate so high that the available complexity and even worse the design productivity required to convert algorithms into silicon are left far behind. This effect is commonly referred to as the design productivity crisis or simply the design gap. Since the design gap is predicted to widen every year, it is of utmost importance to look closer at the design flow of such communication systems in order to find improvements. While various ideas for speeding up designs have been proposed, very few have found their path into existing EDA products. This paper presents requirements for such tools and shows how an open design environment offers a solution to integrate existing EDA tools, allowing for a consistent design flow, considerably speeding up design times.

AB  - Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be used as an alternative treatment for depressed patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to treatment with a conventional antidepressant. This randomized, open-label, multicenter study compared the effectiveness of the SNRI venlafaxine extended release (VXR) with that of conventional antidepressants (CA) in patients who were referred to an outpatient psychiatric specialty care setting for treatment after failure to tolerate or respond to at least 4 weeks of treatment with a CA in a primary care setting. Patients with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) score ≥ 17 were randomly assigned to treatment with an alternative CA or VXR. Remission was defined as a score ≤ 7 on the HAM-D17. Efficacy analyses were carried out on 3,097 patients from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (1,632 VXR; 1,465 CA). The antidepressants prescribed most frequently in the CA group were paroxetine (21.3%), citalopram (20.1%), sertraline (19.1%), fluoxetine (17.0%), and mirtazapine (7.9%). After 24 weeks of treatment, the VXR group demonstrated a significantly higher remission rate than did the CA group (59.3% VXR; 51.5% CA; P &lt;.0001; odds ratio: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.19-1.58; P &lt;.01). Despite the limitations of the open design, the results of this study suggest that venlafaxine extended release may be more effective than the conventional antidepressants used in this study when treating depressed patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to treatment with a conventional antidepressant. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A distributed control system based on heterogeneous agent for mobile robot was described. The system architecture combines three layers including deliberative layer, reactive control layer and coordination layer, and adopts multiple heterogeneous agents to implement corresponding function distributed in different control systems. The information of the instantaneous environmental snap from a laser scanner is used to control the mobile robot dynamically in unknown environment in local planning, while reversed D* algorithm is adopted to search the leave point for avoiding local minimum trap in deliberative planning. Deliberative layer and control layer are implemented by heterogeneous and distributed control system with two low power-consuming industrial control computers. This system architecture realizes the real time of reactive control and the adaptability of deliberative planning in complex environment. Open hardware platform with software Agent architecture has a good scalability and provides a paradigm for mobile robot design.

AB  - Object: To compare efficacy and safety of milnacipran and fluoxetine in a population of Korean patients with major depression. Research design and methods: The design was a multi-centre, randomised, comparative clinical study. Patients with major depression (DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) scoring over 17 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and over 21 points on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were recruited and randomised to receive milnacipran (50 mg/ day increasing after 1 week to 100 mg/day) or fluoxetine (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks. All previous medication was stopped at least 7 days before entry into the study. Patients were evaluated (HAM-D, MADRS and clinical global impression scale, CGI) at baseline and after 1,2,4 and 6 weeks of treatment. All adverse events which developed during the study period were recorded. Results: 70 patients (milnacipran 39; fluoxetine 31) were included in the study. Total score on both HAM-D, MADRS and CGI decreased significantly in both groups after 1 week and continued to decrease throughout the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups for any measurement at any time point. Both antidepressants were well tolerated. In the milnacipran group, 13 patients reported 28 adverse reactions, and in the fluoxetine group 11 patients reported 18 adverse reactions. Two patients discontinued due to adverse events in the milnacipran group and three in the fluoxetine group. There were no clinically significant modifications in vital signs, routine blood laboratory tests, biochemistry or ECG throughout the study. Nausea and headache were the most frequently reported adverse events with milnacipran while digestive disturbances, diarrhoea and insomnia were more common with fluoxetine. Conclusion: Milnacipran, like fluoxetine, was found to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression in this population of depressed Korean patients. Principal limitations of the study were its open design, its small sample size and its relatively short duration. © 2005 Librapharm Limited.

AB  - Purpose: There is some indirect evidence for altered autoregulation in patients with glaucoma, but only a few studies have measured ocular blood flow directly during changes in ocular perfusion pressure. The present study was designed to compare pulsatile choroidal blood flow and optic nerve head (ONH) blood flow during moderate increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal controls. Design: Two nonrandomized studies comparing blood flow responses in glaucoma patients and controls in an open design. Participants and Controls: Sixteen patients with POAG glaucoma and 16 healthy gender-matched and age-matched controls were included in the choroidal blood flow experiments. The ONH blood flow experiment was performed in 14 POAG patients and 14 healthy gender-matched and age-matched controls. Methods:In the first study, pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed by laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude (FPA). In the second study, ONH blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. In both cohorts, the IOP was increased stepwise by 10 and 20 mmHg using a suction cup. Main Outcome Measures: Fundus pulsation amplitude and ONH blood flow. Results: The baseline values of FPA and ONH blood flow were lower in glaucoma patients as compared with age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls. In patients with POAG, FPA decreased by -4.5±5.8% and -11.3±4.9% during elevation of IOP of 10 and 20 mmHg, respectively. These results were not different from the results in healthy controls, where FPA decreased by -5.1±3.4% and -12.2±4.9% at the 2 pressure levels (P = 0.23 between groups). Optic nerve head blood flow showed no changes during the increase of IOP of 10 and 20 mmHg in either of the 2 groups (glaucoma patients, +2.1±14.7% and -0.8±15.2%; healthy controls, +4.3±12.0% and +0.2±14.2%; P = 0.83 between groups). Conclusions: The present study does not provide evidence for altered autoregulation in patients with POAG during a moderate increase in IOP. However, these results do not necessarily contradict the concept of vascular dysregulation in glaucoma. © 2005 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

AB  - In design of high performance heatsinks, it is vital to understand how the primary constraints of volumetric footprint and hydraulic operating point limit maximum thermal performance. This paper provides a framework to establish a priori maximum attainable levels of air-side cooling performance for a given class of fin geometry over a basis of continuously varied footprint and hydraulic constraints. A model of packaging volume required for air moving devices to deliver flow and pressure is developed. It is shown how single fin thermal model results may be extrapolated to multiple fan-heatsink combinations within an open design space. A method to identify fin-fan combinations to achieve maximum system volumetric conductance levels is presented. The methodology is extendable to other volumetricaly constrained heat exchanger problems. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - In order to evaluate the incidence of hereditary bleeding disorders in patients presenting with menorrhagia, where the usual gynecological and endocrinal causes of bleeding were ruled out by various local ultrasonography (USG) and relevant endocrine investigations, 120 women aged between 18 and 35 years presenting with menorrhagia without any discernable cause were studied using an open design, where the investigators knew that these patients had menorrhagia. These patients were investigated for inherited coagulation defects. Of the 120 women investigated, 19.16% (23 cases) had an inherited coagulation disorder to account for their menorrhagia. Although a majority (11.6%) are patients with von Willebrand's disease (VWD), other rare platelet disorders such as Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (3.3%), Bernard-Soulier syndrome (0.83%), coagulation factor deficiencies such as factor VIII (0.83%), factor X (0.83%), and factor XI (0.83%), and immune thrombocytopenia (0.83%) were also found. Taking a detailed history for bleeding from other sites howsoever minor, paternal consanguinity as well as family history of bleeding tendencies appeared as a very strong predictor for such kinds of disease in patients with menorrhagia. Patients with menorrhagia without a discernable cause, therefore, need evaluation for the congenital coagulation disorders. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - The present study examined the effect of smoking reduction and cessation on asthma regulation and biomarkers of exposure to cigarette smoke. In a prospective open design, we allocated 220 asthmatics among three groups: (a) Smoking reduction (reducers), with the aim of smoking fewer than seven cigarettes per day, (b) complete smoking cessation (abstainers), or (c) continuation of usual smoking (continuing smokers). Subjects used nicotine chewing gum or an oral nicotine inhaler to promote reduction and cessation. We monitored changes in the biomarkers carbon monoxide, cotinine, and thiocyanate, and in peak flow, medicine use, bronchial reactivity, and asthma symptoms. The analysis used the three outcome groups, regardless of original allocation to treatment groups. At 4 months, analysis of abstainers (n=27), reducers (n=33), and continuing smokers (n=50) showed marked, statistically significant decreases in expired carbon monoxide of 17 ppm (abstainers) and 15 ppm (reducers); in plasma cotinine of 124 ng/ml (abstainers) and 122 ng/ml (reducers); and in plasma thiocyanate of 5.03 ng/ml (abstainers) and 3.74 ng/ml (reducers). For abstainers, we observed improvements in the asthma-specific quality-of-life score, and reductions in seff-reported day and night use of rescue β2-agonists, in doses of inhaled corticosteroids, in daytime asthma symptoms, and in bronchial hyperreactivity. For reducers, smaller improvements occurred for night use of rescue β2-agonists, doses of inhaled corticosteroids, and bronchial hyperreactivity. Smoking cessation resulted in a marked decrease in three biomarkers of cigarette smoke inhalation and improved asthma regulation, whereas smoking reduction had a less pronounced effect on biomarkers and only a small effect on asthma regulation. © 2005 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.

AB  - The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is the largest fully public repository for high-throughput molecular abundance data, primarily gene expression data. The database has a flexible and open design that allows the submission, storage and retrieval of many data types. These data include microarray-based experiments measuring the abundance of mRNA, genomic DNA and protein molecules, as well as non-array-based technologies such as serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and mass spectrometry proteomic technology. GEO currently holds over 30 000 submissions representing approximately half a billion individual molecular abundance measurements, for over 100 organisms. Here, we describe recent database developments that facilitate effective mining and visualization of these data. Features are provided to examine data from both experiment-and gene-centric perspectives using user-friendly Web-based interfaces accessible to those without computational or microarray-related analytical expertise. The GEO database is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND ISSSUES: Ginkgo biloba-extracts are often used in therapy of patients with dementia. In this study, benefit and structure of Ginkgo biloba-extract EGb 761 in treatment of patients with dementia was examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For the assessment of quality of life of care-taking relatives and patients as well as treatment costs were documented. The study was conducted as a non-randomised, two-armed cohort study with an open design for 683 slightly or moderately demented patients, aged between 65 and 80 years. Society's perspective was taken. Barthel-Index and MMST were also documented. Because of significant differences at inclusion of both cohorts, a matched-pairs-analysis and multiple regression analysis conducted. RESULTS: According to PLC a significant improvement in quality-of-life of care-taking relatives (p < 0.001) and patients (positive mood p = 0.018, negative mood p < 0.001) was only observed in the Ginkgo-cohort. Also Barthel-Index indicated an improvement in the Ginkgo-cohort (p < or = 0,001). MMST-scores increased significantly only in the Ginkgo-cohort (p < 0.001). Average total cost per patient amounted to 3.614,75 euro in the standard-cohort, whereas these costs per patient in the Ginkgo-cohort amounted to 3.031,78 euro (p = 0.067). Results were confirmed by matched-pairs-analysis. RESULTS: Ginkgo treatment has a valid place in caretaking structure of health services. Gingko attributes to a higher quality of life for both care-takers and patients, the progression of disease is slowed down and treatment costs are lower.

AB  - The present simulation study elaborates on a finite element (FE) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (Gerogiorgis and Ydstie, 2003a) developed for a candidate carbothermic aluminium reactor (Johansen and Aune, 2002), aimed at industrial implementation of carbothermic Al production. Carbothermic reduction is an alternative to the conventional Hall - Héroult electrolysis process and is characterized by cost and environmental advantages as well as by a challenging complexity. Process technology encompasses a wide spectrum of phenomena (convection, diffusion, reaction, evapouration, electric field) that occur simultaneously in a multiphase configuration, the geometry of which is an open design problem and remains to be determined without prior experience or even abundance of experimental data. The strong interaction among Joule heating, endothermic reaction, natural Boussinesq convection and turbulent flow phenomena is of paramount importance for understanding reactor performance; conducting CFD simulations is an efficient way to advance with the latter goal, since reliable high-temperature measurements of state variables are remarkably laborious, uncertain and expensive. The quadruple partial differential equation (PDE) problem (electric charge, heat, momentum and gas volume balances) for the slag flow in the ARP reactor is solved via a commercial CFD software suite (FEMLAB® v. 2.3) to obtain potential, temperature, velocity and gas volume fraction distributions in a two-dimensional domain, representing in detail the complete second stage of the proposed carbothermic reactor. The new challenge is the present paper is to accurately calculate the volume fraction of the gas generated within the molten slag and understand how the proposed geometry affects production, via the instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium assumption. The main objective of this CFD study is to extract conclusions regarding the reactive slag flow, the extent of space utilization and the existence of dead volumes, and to provide design guidelines. A steady state sensitivity analysis of state variable distributions (namely, potential, temperature, velocity and gas volume fraction) with respect to a key design variable (the imposed voltage profile) reveals the reactor heating potential, the geometry of the Al region and the nontrivial operation, design and optimization problems. © 2005 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Aspirin is widely used for its antiplatelet activity, but it harbors a risk of severe adverse gastrointestinal effects, such as bleeding and perforation, especially in elderly people. Our aim to assess the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal lesions and the effect of aspirin on the gastrointestinal mucosa in asymptomatic subjects taking minidose aspirin (100 to 325 mg per day) for more than 3 months. A prospective, open design was used. Patients attending the ophthalmology and cardiology outpatient clinics who had a medical history of more than 3 months of regular aspirin consumption were referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Of the 90 patients referred for EGD, 44 were symptomatic (epigastric pain or dyspepsia) and were excluded from the study. The 46 asymptomatic patients included 22 men and 24 women of mean age 70 ± 10 years (range, 36 to 87 years); 32% were current or former smokers. Mean daily aspirin dose was 129.34 ± 76.61 mg. Only 24% were taking a gastroprotective agent. EGD revealed ulcer or erosions in 47.83% of the patients: erosive gastroduodenitis in 13 patients, gastric ulcer in 14, duodenal ulcer in 2, and gastric and duodenal ulcers in 2. Urease test for Helicobacter pylori infection was positive in 26%. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no factor other than aspirin predictive of a positive endoscopy. Minidose aspirin treatment is associated with a high prevalence of ulcerations of the stomach and duodenum. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Current criticisms regarding vertical mammaplasty include problems with poor immediate postoperative appearance, nipple-areola complex malposition, and excessive lower pole length. These problems can be avoided by proper patient selection, by utilizing correct concepts of skin design, and by observing correct glandular resection and closure concepts. Vertical mammaplasty also can result in other problems, such as hypertrophic circumareolar scars and lower pole deformities, including notching, boxy shape, infra-areolar depression, and flatness. These problems are also largely avoidable by using correct technique. Several basic concepts described previously have not proven necessary to achieve good results. Abandoning some of these principles has contributed to the ability to establish an aesthetically ideal breast shape intraoperatively as well as to a decrease in morbidity. This includes eliminating liposuction as a major integral component of the procedure, eliminating suturing the gland to the pectoralis muscle, not undermining the lower pole skin, and avoiding overly wide skin resection and tight wound closure that produces significant lower pole distortion in the early postoperative period. An important concept that has proven reliable is to use a "closed" design that does not predetermine the areolar opening whenever circumstances permit. When this is not possible, a modification that utilizes the smallest possible circumference as an open design is better than a large "mosque." These alternatives allow greater flexibility in determining final nipple position and also reduce the risk of hypertrophic circumareolar scars. Important glandular resection concepts include creating pillars that are attached to both the skin and the chest wall; making them of adequate dimension to avoid postoperative lower pole shape problems, such as flattening; resecting closer to the skin lateral to the pillars to avoid a boxy breast shape; and using a drain both to assist in accurately determining the endpoint of resection and to avoid postoperative seromas. Key closure concepts include approximation of the superior surfaces of the pillars at their base to maintain vertical height and thereby prevent lower pole flattening; approximation of the inferior surfaces of the pillars to the base of the breast to prevent notching; and proper management of the vertical incision by restricting the purse-string suture effect to only the inferior portion of the incision, where there may be skin excess present. Inclusion of these concepts leads to predictable and improved aesthetic results in vertical mammaplasty. This allows full realization of the purported advantages of vertical mammaplasty and allows this method to be utilized with a level of confidence similar to that seen with inverted-T techniques.

AB  - There were two trials involved in the experiment. Trial 1: the trial was conducted on two Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC) pig farms. One was located in the north of Taiwan and the other was located in the south. Both farms had wet pad and forced ventilation (WPFV) and conventional open design (COD) boar and sow houses. There were 12 Duroc boars, age ranging from 12-24 months. Half of them (6 boars) were raised in a WPFV pig house, and the other half were kept in a COD house. Semen was collected at 5-day intervals from May 1st to the end of October. Sixteen sows (2-8 parity) were served by artificial insemination each week from the beginning of May to the end of Oct. These sows were checked for heat from 18 days to 25 days after insemination. Trial 2: there were four MPFV boar houses involved in the test. Two houses were located in the north of Taiwan, and the other two houses were located in the south. The test was conducted from January 2000 to December 2001. The total number of serviced sows by MPFV-housed boars was 35,105 head and for COD-housed boars 103,065 head. The results showed that the total semen volume, density of sperm, total sperm per ejaculate, sperm motility and morphological abnormality were significantly better (p&lt;0.01) for boar raised in WPFV house than for COD houses. Average sperm motility in June and July was lower than for the other months. Morphological abnormality was higher during May, June and July. Although the results did not reach a significant level, the average value showed that the total volume of boar semen was higher in the north than for the south. The total semen volume production of boar raised in WPFV was higher than for boars raised in COD house, reaching a significant level only in summer. Boars kept in WPFV house had higher total sperm number than boars kept in COD house, reaching a significant level in spring (p&lt;0.05), summer (p&lt;0.01), and fall (p&lt;0.05) but not in winter (p&gt;0.05). Boars raised in WPFV house had significantly higher sperm motility than boars in COD house during spring (p&lt;0.001), summer (p&lt;0.001), fall (p&lt;0.01) and winter (p&lt;0.05). The average farrowing rate and piglets born alive were higher for boars in WPFV house than for boars in COD house, but neither reached a significant level (p&gt;0.05). The present experiment shows that WPFV house can improve the reproduction performance of boars.

AB  - The study objective was to evaluate, by means of automated office and phone-transmitted home blood pressure (OBP and HBP) recordings, the effects of a fixed combination of valsartan 160 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg in hypertensive patients previously uncontrolled with the combination of an angiotensin receptor antagonist and HCTZ. From 241 selected patients, 171 (71%) had uncontrolled hypertension OBP and HBP [mean baseline OBP and HBP systolic and diastolic (SBP/DBP): 157/91 and 152/87 mmHg]. In this open-design study, patients were directly switched from other angiotensin receptor blocker combination products to valsartan/HCTZ for 6 weeks. The same validated automated device was used for OBP and HBP recordings. At baseline, mean HBP was 152 ± 15/87 ± 10 mmHg and mean OBP was 157 ± 12/91 ± 9 mmHg. After 6 weeks of treatment with valsartan 160 mg and HCTZ 25 mg, a significant decrease in BP was observed both at home (146 ± 17/83 ± 12 mmHg) and at the office (151 ± 18/87 ± 11 mmHg), with a difference from baseline of -4 mmHg, p < 0.001 for DBP and of -6 mmHg for SBP, p < 0.001. The percentage of patients with office and home control was 24% and 23% respectively, with a kappa index at 0.459. Elevated OBP only (office hypertension) was observed in 3.6% and elevated HBP only (masked hypertension) in 10% of patients. In conclusion, treatment with valsartan and HCTZ 25 mg in patients with confirmed uncontrolled hypertension induced a clinically relevant decrease in BP with approximately 23% of additional patients strictly controlled with a single tablet. The use of an automated oscillometric device at the office and at home allowed the detection of controlled subjects with good agreement.

AB  - Chloasma (melasma), an acquired hypermelanosis, is often recalcitrant to various treatments and an amenable, as well as safe, pigment-reducing modality is needed. We investigated that the reducing effect of proanthocyanidin, a powerful antioxidant, on chloasma in a one-year open design study. Proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract (GSE) was orally administered to 12 Japanese woman candidates with chloasma for 6 months between August 2001 and January 2002 and to 11 of these 12 for 5 months between March and July 2002. Clinical observation, L* value (lightening) and melanin index, and size (length and width) measurements of chloasma were performed throughout the study period. The first 6 months of GSE intake improved or slightly improved chloasma in 10 of the 12 women (83%, p < 0.01) and following 5 months of intake improved or slightly improved chloasma in 6 of the 11 candidates (54%, p < 0.01). L* values also increased after GSE intake (57.8 ± 2.5 at the start vs 59.3 ± 2.3 at 6 months and 58.7 ± 2.5 at the end of study). Melanin-index significantly decreased after 6 months of the intake (0.025 ± 0.005 at the start vs 0.019 ± 0.004 at 6 months) (p < 0.01), and also decreased at the end of study (0.021 ± 0.005) (p < 0.05). GSE is effective in reducing the hyperpigmentation of women with chloasma. The beneficial effects of GSE was maximally achieved after 6 months and these was no further improvement after this period. The latter GSE intake for 5 months may prevent chloasma from becoming worse prior to the summer season. GSE is safe and useful for improving chloasma. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - To date, the market for open-source software has significantly grown. Currently, the issue is whether open-source hardware (OSH)will be as successful as open-source software. A look at the market shows that some open-source reduced-instruction-set computing (RISC) microprocessor projects are already available. However, other issues still looms indicating that a design constructed entirely of OSH blocks is not likely to be a commercial success.

AB  - Open design methodology (mathematical modeling by means of linear and nonlinear programming with negotiable constraints) is applied to three options for the extension of Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam:(1) extension at the current location,(2) moving take-off and landing operations to an artificial island in the North Sea, and(3) using the island also to relieve other European airports from intercontinental air traffic. The latter option has great potential, but requires that decision making on the issue be moved to an international level. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adult GH deficiency (GHD) is linked to endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease. We examined the effect of 12 months of GH therapy on endothelial function, C-reactive protein (CRP) and coronary risk. DESIGN: Open-design intervention study. PATIENTS: Fourteen GH-deficient patients (nonsmokers, without diabetes, hypertension or vascular disease) studied before, 6 months and 12 months after GH therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) thrombomodulin (TM), E-selectin, CRP, lipid profile, blood pressure and anthropometric data were recorded. We used the Framingham equation to calculate coronary risk. RESULTS: FMD improved (7.5 ± 1.62 vs. 11.93 ± 1.52, P = 0.038). Overall there was no change in IMT, TM, E-selectin or CRP. The correlation between TM and FMD showed a trend for statistical significance (r = -0.54, P = 0.056). Changes in CRP correlated with change in IGF-1 (r = -0.67, P = 0.012); E-selectin correlated with high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (r = -0.60, P = 0.028), triglycerides (r = 0.68, P = 0.01) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.71, P = 0.006). Systolic (127.36 ± 4.47 vs. 120.36 ± 3.50, P = 0.017) and diastolic (84.71 ± 2.73 vs. 76.93 ± 2.03, P = 0.005) blood pressure decreased. HDL-cholesterol increased (0.70 ± 0.05 vs. 0.93 ± 0.06, P = 0.001). WHR decreased (0.90 ± 0.02 to 0.88 ± 0.02, P = 0.043) without changes in weight or body mass index (BMI). Ten-year absolute (P = 0.009) and relative (P= 0.002) cardiac risk decreased. CONCLUSION: Biophysical test of endothelial function (FMD) improved after 12 months of GH therapy but there was no significant change in biochemical endothelial or inflammatory markers. Calculated coronary risk decreased mainly due to reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increase in HDL-cholesterol.

AB  - In contrast to the effects seen in younger adults, depressed elderly subjects have shown more modest antidepressant responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We theorized that higher stimulation intensities in older depressed subjects with prefrontal atrophy might be needed to stimulate underlying cortex. In an open design with patients on stable baseline medications, we treated 18 treatment-resistant elderly depressed subjects (mean age 61.2 ± 7.3) with 15 rTMS sessions over 3 weeks. We adjusted the delivered TMS intensity to account for MRI measured prefrontal atrophy. The skull to prefrontal cortex distance increased with age, whereas the skull to motor cortex distance did not. All subjects tolerated the higher doses well. The average intensity used was 114% of motor threshold (MT) with a range from 103-141% MT. There was an average 35% decline over the 3 weeks in HRSD scores. After 3 weeks of treatment, 27% (5/18) met response criteria (> 50% improvement), with four of these five also meeting criteria for remission (exit Hamilton Depression Score < 8). These initial pilot findings support the need for blinded studies using prefrontal TMS in an elderly population, testing whether TMS, delivered at stimulation intensities calculated to overcome atrophy, is more effective than TMS without adjusting for atrophy. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Study Design. Open design cross-sectional questionnaire. Objectives. The aims of this study are to determine the frequency of low back pains in the younger population and the factors that have an influence on this frequency. Summary of Background Data. Low back pain is one of the most important social problems that causes injuries in the younger population. Low back pain frequency is around 30% among adolescents and 88% of those with low back pain experiences in adolescence have low back pain in later years. Therefore, identifying and, if possible, preventing the associated factors in adolescence and young adulthood is essential for the solution of this social problem. Methods. A total of 1,552 students from a total of 8,000 who had come from all parts of Turkey for university registration accepted to participate in the study and were given a questionnaire about low back pain experiences, disability, and possible associated factors. Results. Low back pain frequency was found to be 40.9%. This rate increases with age. Abandonment of moderate level physical activity and traumas such as slipping on ice and falling down the stairs were identified as associated factors. Conclusions. Regular physical activity and the prevention of falls might be ways for decreasing the frequency of low back pain experiences among the youth and significantly influencing the frequency of low back pain in adult population.

AB  - A rapid forming open platform was developed for the forming of various kinds of bio-materials. The process includes material dissolving, jetting and depositing, solidifying at low temperatures, and freeze-drying. Various polymers or polymer based composites can be fabricated into random three-dimensional shapes on the platform. The spray head, temperature control and motion control modules are key parts of the platform. The open design uses standard spray heads which can be easily replaced. Material phase change and thermally induced phase separation of materials are controlled by controlling the spray head and working chamber temperatures. The result shows that some bio-materials, such as fatty group polyesters and polyether ester elastomers, can be successfully formed using the platform.

Women were assigned to one of the following regimens depending on the presence of risk factors for osteoporosis, climacteric symptoms and an intact uterus: conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg (CEE, n = 34), continuous combined CEE 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 5 mg, (n = 80), continuous combined 17β-estradiol 2 mg plus norethisterone acetate (NETA) 1 mg (n = 58), tibolone 2.5 mg (n = 83) and raloxifene HCl 60 mg (n = 50). Forty-five postmenopausal women with no indications for HRT served as controls. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestrol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels were assessed in each subject at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months of therapy. All therapy regimens lowered TC levels compared to baseline (4.2-8.0% decrease). This effect was more prominent in the subgoup of women with high baseline TC levels (9.1-20.4% decrease). LDL cholesterol decreased significantly in CEE, CEE/MPA and raloxifene groups (-11.2%, -11.9% and -11.0%, respectively). Hypercholesterolemic women exhibited a steeper decrease in LDL cholesterol (10.6-27.8% in all therapy groups). TG levels increased significantly in the CEE and CEE/MPA groups (23.7% and 21.8%, respectively), while estradiol/NETA had no effect on TG levels. Tibolone decreased TG levels markedly, by 20.6%, while raloxifene had no TG-lowering effect. HDL cholesterol and ApoA1 were increased by CEE and CEE/MPA (HDL cholesterol, 7.4% and 11.8%, respectively; ApoA1, 17.8% and 7.9%, respectively) and decreased by tibolone (HDL cholesterol, -13.6%; and ApoA1, -9.9%). All therapy regimens except raloxifene lowered Lp(a) levels, with tibolone having the more pronounced effect (-13.2 to -29.0%). In conclusion, each therapy regimen had a different effect on lipid-lipoprotein levels, exerting favorable. and unfavorable modifications. Hypercholesterolemic women seemed to benefit more from the cholesterol-lowering effect of estrogen replacement therapy/HRT. The choice for a particular regimen should be based on individual needs, indications and lipid-lipoprotein profile.

AB  - Permanent continuous power quality monitoring is beginning to be recognized as an important aid for managing power quality. Preventive maintenance can only be initiated if such monitoring is available to detect the minor disturbances that may precede major disruptions. This paper establishes the need to encourage interoperability between power quality instruments from different vendors. It discusses the frequent problem of incompatibility between equipment that results from the inherent inflexibilities in existing designs. A new approach has been proposed to enhance interoperability through the use of open systems in their design. It is demonstrated that it is possible to achieve such open design using existing software and networking technologies. The benefits and disadvantages to both the end-users and the equipment manufacturers are also being discussed.

AB  - This study examined the influence of various conflict management mechanisms embedded into computer-supported collaborative concept mapping systems on the behaviour and learning of elementary students. Four conflict management mechanisms were compared: an assign design, in which the mapping control was designated to a particular group member; a rotate design, in which the mapping control was rotated among the group members; a give design, in which the child with mapping control could relinquish control to another group member; and an open design, in which every group member simultaneously had mapping control. Ninety-six fifth and sixth grade Taiwanese students participated in this study. They were arranged into assign, rotate, give, or open three-member groups to generate collaboratively shared concept maps. Student interactions, attitudes, and achievement were analysed. The results suggest that each conflict management mechanism has a different effect on the elementary students.

AB  - As pharmacokinetics represents a bridge between pharmacological concentrations and clinical regimens, the pharmacokinetic exploration of the therapeutic dose range is a major outcome. This study was aimed at assessing pharmacokinetic linearity of i.v. vinorelbine through an open design with intra-patient dose escalation (3 doses/group). Three groups of six patients received either 20-25-30 mg/m, or 25-30-35 mg/m2; or 30-35-40 mg/m2. The inclusion criteria were: histologically confirmed tumour with at least one assessable target lesion, age 25-75 years, WHO PS ≤ 2, normal haematology and biochemistry, life expectancy ≥3 months. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated in both whole blood and plasma over 120 h. Twenty-six patients were recruited and 18 were evaluable for pharmacokinetics. The toxicity consisted in grade ≤ 3 leucopenia and neutropenia (&lt; 20% of courses) and two grade 4 constipation with rapid recovery (2/54 courses). Compared to blood, plasma was demonstrated to underestimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. In blood, the drug total clearance was about 0.6 l/h/kg, with minor contribution of renal clearance, steady state volume of distribution close to 13 l/h/kg, and elimination half-life at about 40 h. A pharmacokinetic linearity was demonstrated up to 40 mg/m2, and even up to 45 mg/m2 when pooling data from another study. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship was evidenced on leucopenia and neutropenia when pooling the data from the two studies. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Growth hormone replacement in adult growth hormone deficient patients improves psychological well-being and the quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate relationship between changes in mood, cognitive functioning, quality of life, changes in body composition and hormone concentration at baseline and six months after treatment with human recombinant growth hormone. Eighteen adult patients with growth hormone deficiency syndrome were recruited to the study. Growth hormone was administered in doses of 12 IU per week in an open design. After 6 months of growth hormone replacement therapy the psychological functioning improved significantly on mood scales (Profile of Mood State) and on a cognitive performance tests. Changes in quality of life scale were trivial. After growth hormone treatment serum concentration of Insulin like growth factor -1 (IGF-1) and triiodothyronine increased and concentration of serum free thyroxine decreased significantly in comparison to basal concentration. There were no significant differences in changes of plasma cortisol, thyrotropin and growth hormone concentrations. Improvement on Profile of Mood State global score as well as on Vigor-Activity subscale correlated significantly with increase in IGF-1 concentration. Improvement on Profile of Mood State Vigor-Activity subscale correlated with increase in water body mass and improvement on Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale depression subscale correlated with decrease in cortisol concentration. The study shows that growth hormone replacement improves mood and cognition in adult growth hormone deficient patients. This improvement is related to changes in water body mass as well as to endocrine changes.

AB  - Background In randomized trials there may be no overriding reason whether or not to have a placebo control. Purpose We assessed the effects of an open trial design (no placebo and people know what tablets they are given) compared with a blinded, placebo-controlled design on recruitment, compliance and retention within a randomized trial of secondary osteoporotic fracture prevention. Methods We undertook a randomized controlled comparison nested within a placebo-controlled trial of nutritional supplementation amongst people aged 70 years or over who had previously sustained a fracture, recruited in a UK teaching hospital. Randomization was 2: 1 in favour of the blinded, placebo-controlled trial design. Results From 180 eligible participants randomized to receive information based on the open trial design, 134 (74.4%) consented to take part, compared with 233 (65.1%) of 358 people randomized to the blinded, placebo-controlled design (difference 9.4%, 95% confidence interval 1.3–17.4%). Reluctance to take a placebo and the desire to know tablet allocation were reasons given for not taking part in the blinded, placebo-controlled design. There was no significant difference in tablet compliance. Open trial participants were more likely to remain in the trial for one year (difference 13.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.1–24.6%), mainly reflecting the high retention of the open trial no tablet group compared to the open trial tablet group (difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9–35.2%). The odds ratio for reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo-controlled design was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.28–1.49), and for reporting a fracture was 0.81 (0.36–1.85). Conclusions We conclude that using an open trial design may enhance participant recruitment and retention and thus improve generalizability and statistical power, but withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the internal validity of the trial. © 2004, Sage Publications.

AB  - Advances in IC fabrication technology have made the design of complex and powerful embedded appliances feasible. To design such appliances, a hardware/software co-design methodology, which allows concurrent hardware and software development before a system prototype is available, is the preferred solution. While different hardware and software specification techniques present obstacles that each combined approach has to overcome, the introduction of SystemC, a C++ class library for hardware and system level specification, has opened a new horizon. This paper combines open source components, to built a custom and flexible co-simulation environment based on SystemC. Even though commercial solutions for this problem have recently been introduced, their high cost and small to medium scale customization capability, make this open source and fully customizable competitor look appealing, especially for researchers and small companies.

AB  - Background: In order to use a combination of ivermectin and albendazole for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, it is important to assess the potential risk of increased adverse events in individuals infected with both lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. We compared the safety and efficacy of albendazole (400 mg) in combination with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg), for the treatment of co-infections of Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus with single infection of W. bancrofti. Methods: The safety study on co-infections was a crossover, double blind design, while for the single infection of bancroftian filariasis an open design comparing two treatments was used. For coinfection, one group was allocated a single dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg) plus albendazole (400 mg) (Group A). The other group received placebo (Group B). Five days later the treatment regime was reversed, with the Group A receiving placebo and Group B receiving treatment. For the single bancroftian filariasis infection, one group received a single dose of albendazole (400 mg) plus ivermectin (150 μg/kg) (Group C) while the other group received a single dose of albendazole (400 mg) alone (Group D). Blood and skin specimens were collected on admission day, day 0, and on days 2, 3, and 7 to assess drug safety and efficacy. Thereafter, blood and skin specimens were collected during the 12 months follow up for the assessment of drug efficacy. Study individuals were clinically monitored every six hours during the first 48 hours following treatment, and routine clinical examinations were performed during the hospitalisation period and follow-up. Results: In individuals co-infected with bancroftian filariasis and onchocerciasis, treatment with ivermectin and albendazole was safe and tolerable. Physiological indices showed no differences between groups with co-infection (W. bancrofti and O. volvulus) or single infection (W. bancrofti). The frequency of adverse events in co-infected individuals was 63% (5/8, Group A, albendazole + ivermectin) and 57% (4/7, Group B, placebo) and of mild or moderate intensity. In single W. bankrofti infection the frequency of adverse events was 50% (6/12, Group C, albendazole + ivermectin) and 38% (5/13, Group D, albendazole) and of a similar intensity to those experienced with co-infection. There were no differences in adverse events between treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the reduction of microfilaraemia following treatment with albendazole and ivermectin in groups with single or co-infection. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ivermectin plus albendazole is a safe and tolerable treatment for co-infection of bancroftian filariasis and onchocerciasis. © 2003 Makunde et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Spinbox SC-R is at the heart of Rieter's open end spinning machine, with Suessen collaborating with Rieter to provide the spinboxes used in the Rieter machine. The spinbox SC-R is the rtss of that collaboration, and builds upon a former cooperative effort with Schlafhorst. The open design of the Rieter machine allows fly collection to be easily made, avoiding accumulation. Some detail of the machine is shown including a photo eye for alignment accuracy. Another feature described is the undivided fibre channel, which has just been optimised. Trash collection and the problems surrounding efficient ways of implementing it are discussed in detail. The Suessen solution is the Bypass, an adjustable second opening for the airflow that now offers for the first time adjustable trash collection at the mill.

AB  - Background and objective: Nitric oxide (NO) is an almost ubiquitous messenger molecule and is implicated in several disorders. NG monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA:546C88) is an inhibitor of all three NO synthases (NOS), the enzymes that catalyse the production of NO. The present study was performed to evaluate the dose-response relation of L-NMMA to improve the design and interpretation of studies in migraine sufferers and other diseases. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, six healthy volunteers were randomised to receive three different doses of L-NMMA (0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg) or placebo (5% dextrose) intravenously (iv) over 5 min on four different days. On a fifth study day, in an open design, the same subjects received L-NMMA in the dose 6 mg/kg iv over 15 min. The effect of L-NMMA on the maximal mean blood velocity (Vmean) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) (transcranial Doppler), the luminal diameter of the radial artery (high-frequency ultrasound), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate and electrocardiogram were repeatedly followed every 5 min until 60 min after start of the infusion, then every 15 min during the following hour, and at 3 h and 4 h. Results: Inhibition of NOS had no effect on V mean in MCA or on the diameter of the radial artery, but MAP increased and heart rate decreased dose dependently. With a dose of 6-mg/kg L-NMMA infused over a 15-min period, the maximum MAP increase was 20% 20 min after the start of L-NMMA infusion. The maximum decrease of heart rate was 24% 15 min after start of the L-NMMA infusion. Conclusion: L-NMMA in a dose that caused marked changes in systemic blood pressure and heart rate had no effect on cerebral and radial arteries in man.

AB  - The importance of exact patient positioning in radiation therapy increases with the ongoing improvements in irradiation planning and treatment. Therefore, new ways to overcome precision limitations of current positioning methods in fractionated treatment have to be found. The Department of Medical Physics at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) follows different video-based approaches to increase repositioning precision. In this context, the modular software framework FIVE (Fast Integrated Video-based Environment) has been designed and implemented. It is both hardware- and platform-independent and supports merging position data by integrating various computer-aided patient positioning methods. A highly precise optical tracking system and several subtraction imaging techniques have been realized as modules to supply basic video-based repositioning techniques. This paper describes the common framework architecture, the main software modules and their interfaces. An object-oriented software engineering process has been applied using the UML, C++ and the Qt library. The significance of the current framework prototype for the application in patient positioning as well as the extension to further application areas will be discussed. Particularly in experimental research, where special system adjustments are often necessary, the open design of the software allows problem-oriented extensions and adaptations.

AB  - Background: The safety and efficacy of the combination of risperidone and topiramate in the long-term treatment of mania were assessed in a 12-month, multicenter open study. Method: Subjects (N = 58) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and for a manic episode received both risperidone and topiramate for the treatment of their manic symptoms. Patients with mixed episodes were excluded. Risperidone could be discontinued at any point, but patients had to be on topiramate therapy for at least 12 months to be considered completers. Efficacy was assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and a modified version of the Clinical Global Impressions for Bipolar Disorder (CGIBP-M). Safety was assessed with systematic collection of side effect data, weight, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) scores, to address the risk of switch into depression. Results: 41 patients (70.7%) completed the study. There was a significant improvement on the YMRS (p < .001) and the CGI-BP-M subscales for manic symptoms (p <.005) and long-term outcome (p <.005) from week 2 onward. Relapse rates were significantly lower during the 12-month study period compared to the precedent year (p < .0001). There was no increase in depressive symptoms as measured by the HAM-D. 37 patients (63.8 %) experienced at least 1 adverse event, the most frequent of which was somnolence (N = 7, 12.1 %). At endpoint, the patients' mean weight had decreased an average of 1.1 ± 0.4 kg. Conclusion: Despite the limitations inherent to the open design, this naturalistic study suggests that the combination of risperidone and topiramate may be a valuable option for the short-and long-term treatment of mania.

AB  - The authors investigated the microlevel processes of collaborative reasoning in heterogeneous peer dyads working on an open-design task in elementary geometry. Special attention was paid to the nature of student social interaction, problem-solving strategies, and mathematical language and how they shape collaborative problem-solving processes. Qualitative case-based analyses of 3 focal dyads reveal that collaborative reasoning was supported by equal participation in social interaction, consisting of joint negotiation of problem-solving strategies and active conceptualization and visualization of the situation. Challenges to collaboration were manifested in the existence of divergent strategies and verbal conceptualizations where negotiation did not lead to the construction of a shared understanding. In summary, the study demonstrates the power of microlevel process analyses in revealing the interpersonal dynamics of collaborative reasoning and shows how those dynamics mediate the learning opportunities in peer interactive dyads. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - An understanding of the effects of different opener designs and on-row packing force would help producers in their selection of appropriate direct seeding implement options for their soil conditions. A field trial was conducted at three locations (Indian Head, Sylvania and Watrous) in Saskatchewan from 1997 to 1999 to evaluate the effect of opener-packer design (spoon-steel V packer; spoon-flat rubber packer; paired row-steel V packer; paired row-flat rubber packer; sweep-pneumatic tire) in combination with a range of on-row packing forces [0, 333, 549, 746, and 1000 Newton (N) per press wheel] on crop emergence and grain yield with direct seeding. The differences observed between opener-packer combinations in this study varied by less than 10% for grain yield, and were almost always associated with the opener design and not the packer type. Despite the variable results, there was a tendency for higher pea and wheat emergence with the sweep + tire compared with other opener types at those locations that tended to be drier in the spring. Also, grain yield tended to be greater for the sweep + tire in 1999 at Indian Head, when the heavy-textured soil at this site had high soil moisture conditions at seeding. The responses to packing force varied with different years and among the crops. Generally, 333 N per press wheel provided adequate emergence and grain yield across the environmental conditions encountered in this study, regardless of the opener-packer combination. In 1997, 5% more pea seedlings emerged with some amount of packing compared with no packing. Relative to the check, some packing resulted in wheat grain yield that was 13% greater at three of the location-by-year combinations, and wheat emergence that was 9% greater in 1998. However, with canola excessive packing force (i.e., the two highest vs. lower packing forces) resulted in 11 fewer seedlings m-2 in 1999. A packing pressure of 333 N per press wheel provided adequate emergence and grain yield across varied environmental conditions, with higher packing force only negatively influencing emergence in canola, and not yield.

AB  - Background: In a previous study, improvement of antipsychotic-induced blefarospasm and involuntary oral-mandibulo movements were observed with the use of the anticonvulsant drug gabapentin among affectively ill patients who had been exposed to maintenance neuroleptics. The results reported in the present paper represent the sequel to the previous study. Methods: The purported efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia has been assessed in an open design 1-year follow-up study, in which 30 schizoaffective, bipolar I and schizophrenic patients from seven Italian centres were evaluated by means of AIMS. The results showed a statistically significant time-related decrease in AIMS scores. The mean percentage of improvement at AIMS was 47.5±18.2%. An improvement of more than 35% after 1 year in 76% of the subjects who completed the trial (n=25) and in 63.3% of the entire sample admitted to the study was revealed. Limitation: Open trial. Conclusion: The introduction of new antipsychotic drugs has probably already limited the problems related to tardive dyskinesia. However, this type of side-effect is also observed during the course of treatment with atypical neuroleptics albeit with a lesser frequency. The fact that gabapentin treatment may have further improved clinical conditions of patients in whom therapeutic protocols had already been modified, appears to suggest exertion of a possible synergic action by the new neuroleptics on tardive dyskinesia. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Objective: Our aim was to compare the effect of lacidipine and chlorthalidone on cardiovascular outcome as a primary parameter and blood pressure as a secondary in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension in a prospective study with an open design. Methods: 1882 males and females outpatients ≥60 years were randomly assigned to the administration of chlorthalidone 12.5 mg o.d. or lacidipine 4 mg o.d. Patients were recruited if sitting systolic blood pressure was ≥160 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure equal or lower than 95 mmHg. Primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Results: At randomization mean systolic blood pressure was 178.1 mmHg in the lacidipine and 178.2 mmHg in the chlorthalidone group, the corresponding mean diastolic values being 86.9 and 86.8 mmHg. In both lacidipine and chlorthalidone groups treatment caused a significant (p < 0.001) and marked systolic blood pressure reduction which was maintained throughout the treatment period with a significant (p < 0.001) and steady although less marked reduction in diastolic blood pressure as well. At the end of treatment period (median 32 months), the reduction was 36.8/8.1 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) in the chlorthalidone and 38.4/7.9 mmHg in the lacidipine group, the final on treatment blood pressures being 142.0/79.2 and 143.2/79.5 mmHg, respectively. Treatments were similarly effective in males and females and in age groups between 60 and 69 years (n = 763), 70 and 79 years (n = 744) and ≥80 years (n = 375). Similar reductions were obtained in a subgroup of patients (n = 209) followed in double-blind fashion for 1 year. The overall incidence of the primary endpoints was 9.3% with no significant between-group difference. Total mortality was also similar between groups. Conclusions: In elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, administration of lacidipine or chlorthalidone markedly reduced systolic blood pressure with no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events and total mortality.
Indications:940 patients with systolic hypertension. Coexisting diseases: 274 cardiovascular diseases, 119 diabetes mellitus.
Patients:1882 outpatients. Hygroton group: 940 patients (355 males, 585 females; aged 72.4 ± 7.6 years). Lacidipine group (942 patients (373 males, 569 females; aged 72.3 ± 7.5 years). Follow-up visits were made at monthly intervals during the first 3 months after randomization and thereafter after 6 months and every year for a maximum of 5 years.
TypeofStudy:The aim of this was to compare the effect of Hygroton and lacidipine on cardiovascular outcome and blood pressure in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension in a prospective multicenter randomized, study with an open design. A subgroup was followed in a double blind fashion (systolic hypertension in the elderly: lacidipine long-term study SHELL)
DosageDuration:Dosage: 12.5 mg once daily increased to 25 mg if response was not satisfactory after 4 weeks and then reduced to initial dose 4 weeks later. Duration: up to 5 years.
ComparativeDrug:Lacidipine: 4 mg once daily increased to 6 mg if response was not satisfactory after 4 weeks and then reduced to initial dose 4 weeks later ; up to 5 years duration.
Results:In the whole group of patients systolic blood pressure fell markedly during treatment with a smaller reduction in diastolic blood pressure. The reductions were similar in the 2 treatment groups and the changes were maintained throughout the follow-up period (median 32 months). Similar reductions were obtained: in patients aged 60-69, 70-79 and ≥80 years; and in males and females. The reductions were also similar when the smaller number of patients followed for 1 year in a double-blind fashion was considered. Heart rate never showed any significant change. Patients kept in lower-dose monotherapy were 72% (n=678) in the lacidipine group and 47% (n=442) in the Hygroton group, while those in higher-dose monotherapy were 12.8% (n=121) and 25% (n=235), respectively. The corresponding figures for the group followed in a double-blind fashion were 71.1%, 66.7%, 12.4% and 15.2% , respectively. During follow-up, patients who remained on randomized treatment were 79.5% (n=749) in the lacidipine group and 75.5% (n=710) in the Hygroton group. The overall incidence of the primary endpoint was 9.3% (88 and 90 for Hygroton and lacidipine, respectively) with no significant between-group difference. The overall mortality rate (obtained by death certificates) was higher (14.2%; 122 and 145 for Hygroton and lacidipine, respectively) due to a high incidence of deaths diagnosed as of non-cardiovascular or unknown origin. There was again no between-group difference in all-cause mortality. The event-free curves were superimposable in the 2 groups throughout, both for primary endpoints and for the primary and secondary endpoints combined. Patients lost to follow-up were 12.3% (n=116) in the lacidipine and 11% (n=103) in the Hygroton group, respectively.
AdverseEffects:Patients under lacidipine treatment showed a greater incidence of pretibial edema, whereas patients under Hygroton treatment showed a greater incidence of fatigue. Other side-effects were similar between the 2 groups. Similar data were obtained in the patients of the double-blind protocol and in patients aged ≥80 years. 117 patients experienced dizziness, 193 fatigue, 60 headache, 46 edema, 15 skin rash, 36 itching, 74 skeletal muscle disorders, 43 paresthesia, 54 constipation, 24 orthostatic hypotension, 38 cough.
AuthorsConclusions:Treatment was equally effective with chlorthalidone and lacidipine, a finding that was observed also in the subgroup of patients followed in a double-blind fashion.
FreeText:At baseline, in the Hygroton and lacidipine groups, respectively: systolic blood pressure (mmHg) was 178.2 ± 10.3 and 178.1 ± 10.2; diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) was 86.8 ± 5.8 and 86.9 ± 5.7; heart rate (beats/min) was 76.3 ± 9.5 and 76.0 ± 9.4. Additional treatment given after 8 weeks when after 4 weeks blood pressure reduction was not satisfactory (reduction ≤ 20 mmHg and absolute value > 160 mmHg): fosinopril (10 mg once daily) or any other dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor (at an equivalent dose). Tests done: blood pressure and heart rate determinations. The primary endpoints were a composite of fatal and non-fatal stroke, sudden death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and nonfatal congestive heart failure, myocardial revascularization and carotid endarterectomy. Secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and non-Q myocardial infarction.

AB  - Background context: The use of interbody fusion cages as a treatment for degenerative disc disease has become widespread. Low-profile cages have been developed to allow a closer fit when implanting bilateral cages in patients with smaller vertebral bodies. Some surgeons feel the open design also allows better bone contact and visualization. This is particularly true when two low-profile cages are used adjacent to one another. Because of the open design of low-profile interbody fusion cages, there has been concern regarding such issues as subsidence, lordosis and fusion rates. Purpose: This retrospective review of paired bilateral reduced profile interbody fusion cages was completed to assess changes in subsidence, lordosis and fusion. As a secondary goal, patient outcomes were measured to determine overall health since surgery and the patient's satisfaction with the spine surgery, in an attempt to assess the effect of the outcome variables cited supra. Study design: This was a retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion with low-profile interbody fusion cages. Patient sample: Seventy-one consecutive patients who underwent bilateral implantation of low-profile interbody fusion cages were evaluated. Outcome measures: A patient self-evaluation, which included a Short Form (SF)-36 and questions regarding patient satisfaction were administered to patients who were at least 1 year postoperative. Subsidence and lordosis measurements were completed. Fusion was assessed by the operating surgeon. Methods: Low-profile interbody fusion cages (BAK/Proximity, Centerpulse Spine-Tech, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) were implanted bilaterally in at least one level from L3-L4 to L5-S1. Most patients had degenerative disc disease with leg and back pain that was not responsive to conservative treatment and demonstrated segmental instability or collapse. A small percentage of patients had either a degenerative spondylolisthesis (7.0%) or an isthmic spondylolisthesis (4.2%). Autograft harvested from the iliac crest was used in all cases. Demographic, surgical and follow-up data were retrospectively collected from patient charts. A clinical outcome questionnaire that included an SF-36 as well as questions regarding patient satisfaction was either mailed to each patient who was at least 1 year postsurgery or given to patients to complete at their 1-year visit. Patients were routinely followed radiographically before surgery, immediately after surgery and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Fusion was assessed by the operating surgeon using lateral radiographs often in conjunction with a thin-slice computed tomography (CT) scan. Criteria for a successful fusion were lack of motion, anterior bridging bone and lack of lucencies on flexion/extension X-rays and/or contiguous bone through the cage using a thin-cut sagittal CT scan. Lateral X-rays on each patient were also measured for subsidence and lordosis changes. Results: A total of 71 patients (45 men, 26 women) with a mean age of 43.4 years (range, 25 to 74) were evaluated. Thirty-six percent of the patients were smokers, and 96% were worker's compensation patients. Thirty-two percent of the patients had previous lumbar surgery. A total of 100 operative levels were evaluated. There were 45 one-level, 23 two-level and three three-level cases. Forty-nine percent were level L5-S1, 43% were L4-L5 and 8% were L3-L4. The mean duration of symptoms was 31.5 months. Mean surgical time, mean blood loss and mean hospital stay were 139 minutes, 186 cc and 3.34 days, respectively. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications attributable to the construct and no cases of cage migration or collapse. Patients who were at least 1-year postsurgery and had follow-up X-rays or had undergone a CT scan at this time point were evaluated for fusion status. Sixty-three patients were assessed for fusion. Fifty-four (86%) of these patients were determined to have a solid fusion. Mean time to fusion was 10 months. Fusion was assessed as solid only if all operative levels were fully fused. Mean subsidence of the anterior region was 1.97 mm, whereas the mean subsidence of the posterior region was 0.82 mm. Lordosis was unchanged at all surgical levels with mean lordosis in L3-L4 decreasing only slightly from 13 degrees before surgery to 12 degrees after surgery. L4-L5 and L5-S1 showed only slight increases in lordosis changing from 17 to 18 degrees at L4-L5 and from 17 to 19 degrees at L5-S1. These changes were not statistically significant. The clinical outcome questionnaires had a return rate of 68%. Of the 48 patients who completed the questionnaire, 75% responded that they were happy with the surgical results and would definitely recommend the surgery to a friend. Sixty-seven percent agreed that surgery met their expectations or that surgery improved their condition enough that they would go through it again for the same outcome. The results of the SF-36 portion of the survey revealed that the physical and mental composite scores were within normal range of the US population that has experienced back pain or sciatica. Conclusion: Bilateral implantation of low-profile cages in this patient population led to satisfactory outcomes. Subsidence and changes in lordosis were minimal. Fusion rates were good especially for one-level cases. Patient satisfaction was relatively high, considering the population consisted of 96% worker's compensation cases. With proper surgical technique, bilateral low-profile cages can be used effectively to treat patients with degenerative disc disease. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by enhanced immune activation, which possibly plays a pathogenic role in this disorder. We therefore examined whether immunomodulation with thalidomide could improve cardiac performance in patients with CHF. Methods: Nine patients with chronic symptomatic CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, who were receiving "optimal" conventional cardiovascular treatment, were given 200 mg thalidomide daily in an open design for a period of 6 weeks. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and LVEF were measured at baseline and on completion of the study. Results: Two patients withdrew because of side effects. Sedation was common and required dose reduction in 6 of 7 patients completing the study. Plasma levels of TNF-α were elevated at baseline compared with levels in healthy control patients, but decreased significantly from 33.9 ± 10.1 pg/mL to 19.3 ± 6.1 pg/mL during therapy (P < .05). LVEF increased in all patients from 26% ± 9% to 34% ± 10% at the end of the observation period (P < .05). Conclusions: In this pilot study, therapy with thalidomide in patients with CHF resulted in decreased TNF-α levels and increased cardiac performance. Although few patients were included, our results suggest that thalidomide should be further investigated as an immunomodulating agent in CHF.

AB  - The acquisition by Rieter of some parts of the Suessen Group eighteen months ago has led to the development of a new rotor spinning machine known as the R 40. Suessen's spinning box expertise has been added to Rieter machine and transport automation expertise to produce the new machine. The R 40 is based on Rieter's R 20 rotor spinning machine, already optimised over several years for maximum reliability. The R 40 offers the advantage of an adjustable "ByPass" system to control airflow in the trash separator according to feed material to allow optimum trash removal, a function that gathers in importance as rotor speeds increase. The open design of the opening roller eliminates fibre accumulation on covers. Accessibility to the spinning box is much improved with easy removal and replacement of components like the opening unit. A full description of other innovations is given. Rieter commitment to its customers is demonstrated by the incorporation of customer ideas in the design with three significant changes listed on page 42.

AB  - Background: A number of open studies and preliminary results of unpublished double-blind trials have suggested that the novel antipsychotic risperidone may be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder. Methods: A total of 174 patients entered this large, open, multicentre trial. Inclusion criteria were: current manic, hypomanic or mixed episode (DSM-IV), and a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of >7. Assessments included the YMRS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser (UKU) subscale for neurological side effects. Results: There were significant reductions (P<0.0001) on the YMRS, PANSS and HAM-D scores and a significant improvement (P<0.0001) in CGI ratings at the endpoint. There were no statistically significant increments in the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms according to the UKU. Risperidone was generally well tolerated. The mean dose of risperidone at the endpoint was 4.9±2.9 mg/day. Conclusions and clinical implications: This open study provides further evidence that risperidone is safe and effective in combination with mood stabilisers in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. Limitations: The open design and the use of concomitant medications make unclear to what extent the positive results were entirely related to risperidone. © Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of estrogen replacement therapy on lipid and glucose metabolism as related to abdominal fat distribution were investigated in fifty-one healthy postmenopausal women aged 52-53 years. They were randomized to treatment with either estradiol 2 mg or placebo daily for three months in a double-blind design. Forty-six women continued with estradiol for another nine months in an open design with the addition of medroxyprogesterone for ten days every three months. Intra-abdominal and subcutaneous abdominal fat, and intrapelvic and subcutaneous pelvic fat was estimated by computed tomography before and after one year of estrogen treatment. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, oral glucose tolerance test and analyses of blood lipids were performed after 3 and 12 months of treatment. Estrogen replacement therapy decreased body fat mass as well as intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fat, but not the subcutaneous fat compartments. LDL cholesterol decreased and HDL cholesterol increased, whereas triglycerides were not changed by one year of estrogen treatment. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were not affected by estrogen treatment. In postmenopausal women estrogen treatment for one year decreased intra-abdominal and intrapelvic fat compartments, but this was not related to changes in plasma lipid levels. Insulin sensitivity and plasma triglycerides were not affected by estrogen treatment.

AB  - Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) design and manufacturing are inherently multi-physical and multi-disciplinary; no single person is able to perform a full development process for a MEM device or system. In this paper we develop a WWW-based design platform for collaborative design of MEMS. The proposed web-based distributed object modeling and evaluation framework with client-knowledge server architecture, KS-WebDOME, allows multi-users/designers in different locations to participate in the same design process. Under this framework, concurrent integrated MEMS design and simulation models can be built using both local and distributed resources, and the design collaboration can be realized by exchanging services between modules based upon CORBA standard communication protocol. To facilitate the rapid construction of the concurrent integrated design models for MEMS, a prototype design system, Web-MEMS Designer, is implemented through concurrent integration of multiple distributed and cooperative knowledge sources and software. By use of the developed prototype system, MEMS design and simulation can be carried out simultaneously and intelligently in an integrated but open design environment on the web. The case of a microgripper design for micro-robotic assembly systems is provided to illustrate how designers in different teams and organizations may participate and collaborate in MEMS design.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bioequivalence of two salbutamol aerosols in healthy subjects using a special pharmacokinetic method. METHODS: A randomized, two - way crossover, open design was adopted. 18 healthy male subjects were enrolled. Single doses of 1200 μg salbutamol as generic salbutamol aerosol (12 × 100 μg) and Ventolin (12 × 100 μg) were administered over 6 min. Mouth rinsing was performed after every inhalation. Blood samples were taken before administration and at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after inhalation. The concentrations of salbutamol in plasma were determined by HPLC assay. The AUC0∼20 min and cmax were evaluated by analysis of variance and two one-sided t-test. RESULTS: The parameters of the reference and test salbutamol aerosols were AUC0∼20 min (0.71±0.32) and (0.46±0.27) ng·h·mL-1, cmax(2.97±1.38) and (1.91±1.18) ng·mL-1, tmax(0.21± 0.07) and (0.19±0.09) h, respectively. The relative bioavailability of the test salbutamol aerosol was 58.4 %. The results of two one-sided t test were as following: T(H)AUC = 6.79, T(L)AUC = -2.81, T(H)cmax = 7.16, T(L)cmax = -1.32. CONCLUSION: The two formulations were not bioequivalent.

AB  - The R40 rotor spinning machine by Rieter is presented. It integrates advanced spinning technology with a high level of automation, combining the Suessen Spin box with machine and transport automation by Rieter. This combination of technologies is due to Rieter's acquisition of parts of the Suessen Group in 2001. The main innovation of the R40 is the new SC-R spinning unit, which was based on the SC-M and adapted to the geometry of the Rieter machine. It features a number of advantages including an adjustable Bypass for trash removal, the open design of the opening roller and greater accessibility of the spin box. The machine offers increased productivity and consequently reduced costs. Piecing speeds in particular are very high, almost the same as spinning speed.

AB  - Purpose: To demonstrate the general utility of the first dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit enabling upright, weight-bearing positional evaluation of the spinal column (pMRI) during various dynamic-kinetic maneuvers (kMRI) in patients with degenerative conditions of the spine. Materials and methods: This study consisted of a prospective analysis of cervical or lumbar imaging examinations. All studies were performed on a recently introduced whole body MRI system (Indomitable™, Fonar Corp, Melville, NY). The system operates at 0.6T using an electromagnet with a horizontal field, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the patient's body. Depending upon spinal level, all examinations were acquired with either a cervical or lumbar solenoidal radiofrequency receiver coil. This unit was configured with a top-open design, incorporating a patient-scanning table with tilt, translation and elevation functions. The unique motorized patient handling system developed for the scanner allowed for vertical (upright, weight bearing) and horizontal (recumbent) positioning of all patients. The top-open construction also allowed dynamic-kinetic flexion and extension maneuvers of the spine. Patterns of bony and soft tissue change occurring among recumbent (rMRI) and upright neutral positions (pMRI), and dynamic-kinetic acquisitions (kMRI) were sought. Results: Depending on the specific underlying pathologic degenerative condition, significant alterations observed on pMRI and kMRI that were either more or less pronounced than on rMRI included: fluctuating anterior and posterior disc herniations, hypermobile spinal instability, central spinal canal and spinal neural foramen stenosis and general sagittal spinal contour changes. No patient suffered from feelings of claustrophobia that resulted in termination of the examination. Conclusion: To conclude, the potential relative beneficial aspects of upright, weight-bearing (pMRI), dynamic-kinetic (kMRI) spinal imaging on this system over that of recumbent MRI (rMRI) include: the revelation of occult disease dependent on true axial loading, the unmasking of kinetic-dependent disease, and the ability to scan the patient in the position of clinically relevant signs and symptoms. This imaging unit also demonstrated low claustrophobic potential and yielded relatively high-resolution images with little motion/chemical artifact.

AB  - An open-design, prospective, non-comparative study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole in the treatment of tinea pedis (interdigital-type, hyperkeratotic-type and the combination of both). Treatment consisted of one pulse of itraconazole, meaning that each patient received 400 mg/day for one week. Clinical and mycologic control examinations were performed at baseline and at the end of treatment; follow-up visits took place at 30 and 60 days after the last medication administration. A total of 44 patients were evaluated. The major causal agent isolated was Trichophyton rubrum (93%). At the final follow-up visit (60 days), 37 cases (84.4%) achieved clinical and mycologic cure; 5 (11.3%) had improvement and 2 cases (4.5%) failed. Three cases reported side effects attributable to itraconazole (6.6%); one patient had a moderate headache and two reported moderate dyspepsia. None of the 3 cases required discontinuation of the medication. We concluded that the administration of one pulse of itraconazole is an effective, safe and short regimen to treat tinea pedis.

AB  - Both hydroxyapatite (Ha) and titanium (Ti) are well-accepted alloplastic materials for ossicular prostheses. Many different designs of Ha and Ti prostheses are presently available. Fourteen surgeons of different seniority and surgical experience were asked to 'test-drive' four different types of ossicular prostheses in cadaveric temporal bones to investigate the user-friendliness of these protheses. The Goldenberg design Ha incus prosthesis and the Dusseldorf design Bell Ti prosthesis were used as partial ossicular replacement prostheses (PORP). The Richards design Ha incus-stapes prosthesis and the Dusseldorf design Aerial Ti prosthesis were used as a total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP). Nine out of 14 surgeons found the Ha PORP to be more user-friendly because of the notch design in the head. The Ti prosthesis was found to be more difficult to manipulate because it was too light. Half of the surgeons preferred the Ti TORP because of the open design of the top-plate. The Ha TORP was thought to be too top-heavy and to have a tendency to fall over.

AB  - Using 6 fresh specimen of horses (age: 5 month to 18 years) transversal, sagittal and coronar section images of head and collum were performed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), among other things for comparison with 3 pathologic cases (pulpitis/periodontitis, retrobulbar neuroepithelioma, edema of the spinal cord/cerebellar hyperplasia). At the first two patients (alive), the examination led to fundamental information on the character and the exact location of the lesion. The open design of the 0,2 Tesla Magnetom Open viva (SIEMENS, D-Erlangen) proved to be padicularly beneficial concerning logistic ana examination possibilities.

AB  - The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.

AB  - Objective: Patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) often require bedside imaging procedures such as radiographs, fluoroscopic placement of enteral feeding tubes, and insertion of vena cava filters. The potential for scattered radiation exposure is a concern to healthcare workers. Our study's purpose was to measure the level of scattered ionizing radiation present in a TICU. Design and Setting: This prospective study was conducted over 3 months in an open-design, ten-bed TICU of a Level I trauma center. Interventions and Measurements: Fifteen dosimeters were placed in selected areas of the TICU to measure the amount of scattered radiation present. Standard radiation protection precautions were used throughout the study period. At the end of each month, data from the dosimeters were sent to the manufacturer for analysis. Main Results: One thousand seventy-four radiologic studies were performed at the bedside during the study period (803 portable chest radiographs, 103 abdominal radiographs, 303 extremity radiographs, 223 spine radiographs, and 15 fluoroscopic procedures). Dosimetry analysis showed < 5 mrem (1/1000 roentgen equivalent in man) scattered radiation per month (< 60 mrem/ year) in each of the monitored areas. All monitored areas measured <2 mrem per week of scattered radiation when adjusted for occupancy. Conclusions: The level of scattered radiation in our TICU is less than the recommended allowable exposure of < 100 mrem/year, indicating that radiation exposure is not a significant occupational hazard in our TICU, even in the setting of frequent use of bedside imaging studies.

AB  - Background: The capsule and ligaments are generally viewed as the primary stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint, but many important activities are performed in midrange positions in which these structures are lax. Hypothesis: In vivo, the humeral head can be centered in the glenoid, even when the shoulder is in positions in which the capsule is lax and even when the shoulder is passively positioned. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: We documented the centering of the humeral head in the relaxed shoulders of six subjects using open-magnet magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: While these shoulders were passively placed in midrange positions (those not at the extremes of motion), the humeral head center was never more than 2.2 mm from the glenoid center (mean + 0.1 ± 1.2 mm). Conclusions: The results suggest that mechanisms other than ligamentous restraint, such as the compressive effect of resting muscle tone into the conforming concavity of the glenoid, may be sufficient to maintain centering of the glenohumeral joint. Further exploration of these mechanisms may lead to methods other than ligament tightening or capsular shrinkage for restoration of stability to joints that are unstable in the midrange of motion. Clinical Relevance: In that many patients with unstable shoulders demonstrate instability in midrange positions, it is hoped that further study of living shoulders will lead to a more effective understanding of the nonligament mechanisms of shoulder stability and the ways in which these stabilizing mechanisms can be restored.

AB  - From the advancement in imaging techniques and computers have emerged the new idea of the vision of image-guided, computer-assisted, minimally invasive surgery (6). While a variety of imaging modalities could be used for image-guided therapy (IGT), MRI has the greatest potential as it can better characterize soft tissue, it is sensitive to temperature for monitoring of thermal therapies and it can detect vascular flow. For these reasons, GE Medical Systems has developed the Signa SP/2. This new concept of "double-doughnut" magnet/system is the most distinctive and versatile open-architecture MR system, specially designed to perform image-guided, computer-assisted minimally invasive interventional/surgical procedures. The most important feature is the integration of a tracking/navigational system to guide image acquisition by instruments such as biopsy needle, laser fiber, cryo probe, etc. The real time imaging mode continuously monitors the position of the instrument in different planes. A more advanced image processing software can be used during thermal ablation for therapy monitoring. The Signa SP/2 has a variety of coils to fulfill the imaging needs during head, spine, breast, abdominal or prostate intervention/surgery. The design of the system allows for easy integration into the standard OR environment. The vertically open design of the magnet allows the opportunity to either do kinematic imaging (lumbar/cervical spine, knee, shoulder) by either standing, kneeling or sitting on a special MR compatible chair. The excellent integration of IGT in the Signa SP/2 will become a new standard for several types of interventions for improved patient outcome.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of 1 mg 17β-estradiol continuously combined with 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg dydrogesterone on the serum lipid profile of postmenopausal women. Design: Serum lipid profile was measured in two 1-year studies performed in healthy, nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women. One study (n = 182) had an open design and investigated oral 17β-estradiol 1 mg daily continuously combined with dydrogesterone 2.5 mg daily; the other study (n = 326) had a double-blind, randomized design and investigated oral 17β-estradiol 1 mg daily continuously combined with dydrogesterone at doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg daily. Results: With all four dosages of dydrogesterone, serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced (-4.6% to -7.6% and -6.3% to -11.6%, respectively), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly increased (+4.3% to +7.4%). Serum apolipoprotein A1 and B also improved significantly, reflecting the favorable changes in high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as did lipoprotein(a). Conclusion: Oral 17β-estradiol 1 mg daily continuously combined with dydrogesterone 2.5 to 20 mg daily has beneficial effects on serum lipid profile in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Background: Cigar smoking has become a quickly growing trend among teenagers, women, and young adults. The objective was to explore whether cigar smoking affects flow-mediated vasodilation in healthy, non-smoking young adults. Methods: This was a prospective randomized trial with open design. It was performed in a cardiology teaching program in a private community hospital that serves as a major referral center within the greater Miami area. Apparently healthy, non-smoking young adult cardiology trainees and staff between the ages of 20 and 45 years were randomly assigned to a cigar smoking group (n = 15) or a control group (n = 14). The main outcome measures were the difference in percent diameter increase in the brachial artery after reactive hyperemia and sublingual nitroglycerin between members of the cigar smoking and control groups at baseline, measured after cigar smoking, and at 5 hours. Results: Twenty-nine participants were randomized. Percent diameter increase in the brachial artery was measured with the use of high-resolution ultrasonography. Baseline percent diameter increase after reactive hyperemia and sublingual nitroglycerin was similar in both groups (6.2% vs 6.7%, P =. 4 and 22% vs 23%, P =. 5, respectively). We observed a 2.5% increase in brachial artery diameter with hyperemia after cigar smoking compared with a 9.4% increase in the control group, P =. 045. Values after nitroglycerin were similar between groups, P =. 2. Between-group analysis showed no significant difference in percent dilation after reactive hyperemia at 5 hours, P =. 4, but a significant difference was seen after sublingual nitroglycerin, P =. 02. Conclusions: These data are compatible with the possibility that cigar smoking may have an acute effect on endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated brachial artery dilation and do not support the possibility of an immediate effect on endothelium-independent vasodilation. Taken together, these results suggest that cigars are not an innocuous alternative to cigarette smoking.

AB  - In addition to dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been reported to play an important role in schizophrenia. Besides blocking dopamine, atypical antipsychotics also block 5-HT receptors. The clinical efficacy of the atypical anti-psychotic clozapine is associated with the 5-HT antagonistic action of the drug and a high serotonergic tone before treatment. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has a receptor-binding profile similar to that of clozapine. The present study investigated whether treatment with olanzapine blocks hormone release induced by the 5-HT2c agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and, if so, whether this 5-HT antagonistic effect is related to treatment response. Eighteen male schizophrenic patients participated in this study. All patients were challenged with m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg orally) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design after a drug-free period of at least 2 weeks. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels were measured every 30 minutes up to 210 minutes after challenge. Patients were treated for 6 weeks with 10 mg olanzapine daily in an open design, after which the challenge tests were repeated. Olanzapine significantly blocked m-CPP-induced ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin release, suggesting that it is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo. This 5-HT antagonistic effect of olanzapine was not significantly correlated with treatment response. Also, no significant correlation was found between m-CPP-induced hormone release before treatment and clinical response after treatment with olanzapine. These findings suggest that olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2c antagonist in vivo but that this is unrelated to its clinical efficacy in this nonrefractory sample of schizophrenic patients.

AB  - Intertrochanteric osteotomies of the proximal femur are used to improve the anatomy and function of the hip joint in a number of orthopaedic diseases. To investigate the geometrical and biomechanical aspects of pre-operative planning we created a set of programs to automatically perform a simulation of intertrochanteric osteotomies on a three-dimensional finite element model of the human proximal femur based on computed tomography (CT) data and using uniform brick-shaped elements. To eliminate artefacts resulting from the rough surface of the brick elements, the femoral head was represented by a tetrahedron-based head that included a cartilage layer and a subchondral cortical zone. Applicability of the procedure was tested by performing a parametric study using a model created from CT scans taken in vivo, by applying individually calculated force conditions for the one-leg stance situation. We found a large influence of osteotomy angle on the observed stress in the femoral head cartilage, especially in a situation with insufficient containment of the femoral head. The model presented here is a biomechanical tool to simulate intertrochanteric osteotomies patient-specifically for a better understanding of the effects of such operations in the individual case. The open design of the described programs allows future interfacing with surgical navigation and robot systems. © 2001 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a new technological approach for in situ investigation of long-term impacts of elevated CO2 concentration (EC) on juvenile forests characterised by an intensive community level and canopy closure phase. Construction of the glass domes is based on the properties of earlier tested open-top chambers (OTCs). An air climatisation device together with an adjustable window system, that forms the shell cover of the domes, is able to keep the required [CO2] in both time and spatial scales with the relatively small consumption of supplied CO2. This is achieved by half-closing the windows on the windward side. We evidenced good coupling of treated trees to the atmosphere, including mutual interactions among trees. The semi-open design of the domes moderates the problems of strong wind, humidity, and temperature gradients associated with OTCs. The frequency distributions of the environmental variations within the domes indicate that: air temperature is maintained within the ambient range ±1.0°C for ca. 80 % of the time, and changes in the relative air humidity vary from -15 to 0 % for ca. 82 % of the time. The most important chamber effect is associated with the penetration of solar irradiance, which is reduced by 26 % compared to the open condition outside the domes. The dimensions of the domes are 10 × 10 m in length and 7 m high in the central part. The experiment was done in three identical stands of twelve-year-old Norway spruce trees. The 56 trees are planted at two different spacings to estimate the impacts of stand spatial structure in relation to EC.

AB  - In this paper a modern gain-scheduling methodology is proposed which exploits recently developed velocity-based techniques to resolve many of the deficiencies of classical gain-scheduling approaches (restriction to near equilibrium operation, to slow rate of variation). This is achieved while maintaining continuity with linear methods and providing an open design framework (any linear synthesis approach may be used) which supports divide and conquer design strategies. The application of velocity-based gain-scheduling techniques is demonstrated in application to a demanding, highly nonlinear, missile control design task. Scheduling on instantaneous incidence (a rapidly varying quantity) is well-known to lead to considerable difficulties with classical gain-scheduling methods. It is shown that the methods proposed here can, however, be used to successfully design an effective and robust gain-scheduled controller. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article describes the combination of a Besocke-type scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment. The open design of the Besocke STM allows the SEM to be implemented as an add-on of a high resolution electron column and a secondary electron detector. The combined instrument is capable of atomic resolution imaging by STM and real time SEM imaging. SEM resolution down to about 80 nm was achieved. Simultaneous operation of STM and SEM is possible. The operation and performance of the combined instrument is illustrated by a variety of examples. Although the instrument is suitable for a wide range of applications where a combination of atomic resolution with lower magnification imaging is required, its operation in an UHV environment makes it particularly appropriate for the study of reactive metal surfaces. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - AIM: To study the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of salbutamol aerosol in healthy volunteers. METHODS: An HPLC method for the determination of salbutamol in human plasma was improved. Ten healthy male subjects were enrolled. A randomized, two-way crossover, open design was adopted. After the subjects inhaled or orally administered salbutamol, fourteen blood samples were taken at predetermined time. The concentrations of salbutamol in plasma were determined by HPLC, and then assessed with PCNONLIN software to obtain the pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailability of aerosol versus water solution. RESULTS: The standard curve was linear over the range 0.2 - 20 ng · mL-1. The intra- and interassay RSDs were 7.01% and 2.10% at 0.4 ng·mL-1 2.18% and 5.25% at 4.0 ng · mL-1 and 4.61% and 4.85% at 15.0 ng · mL-1. The recoveries were between 90% and 110%. The pharmacokinetics of salbutamol aerosol was described well with a two-compartment model, and the parameters for salbutamol inhaled and orally administered were assessed as follows: Tmax were (0.22 ± 0.07) h and (1.8 ± 0.6) h, Cmax were (3.4 ± 1.1) ng · mL-1 and (3.9 ± 1.4) ng · mL-1, T1/2β were (4.5 ± 1.5) h and (4.6 ± 1.1) h, respectively. The AUC0-20 min (inhal) was 7.94 times as high as the AUC0-20 min (po). There were significant differences between Tmax, AUC, K12, K21, α and T1/2α (P &lt; 0.05). The relative bioavailability of salbutamol aerosol was 57.23% compared with its oral solution. CONCLUSION: The assay was sensitive, specific, accurate and precise. The absorption process of salbutamol aerosol in human was significantly different from that of the oral solution. It was demonstrated that AUC0-20 min reflected the lung availability of salbutamol inhaler.

AB  - Objective: In DSM-IV, winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is classified as a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes in winter with full remission of symptoms in summer. However, other groups with "winter depression" have been identified, including patients with incomplete summer remission (ISR) and subsyndromal SAD (sub-SAD, winter depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for major depression). In this study, we compare the clinical characteristics of these three seasonal groups and their response to light therapy. Method: 558 patients assessed at a specialized SAD Clinic were diagnosed using DSM-III-R or DSM-IV criteria. Clinical information was recorded using a checklist at index assessment. A subset of patients (N=192) were treated with an open, 2 week trial of light therapy using a 10 000 lux fluorescent light box for 30 min per day in the early morning. Patients were assessed before and after treatment with the 29 item modified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and clinical response was defined as greater than 50% improvement in scores. Results: The rates of some melancholic symptoms, anxiety, panic, suicidal ideation, and family history of mood disorder were lowest in the sub-SAD group. The clinical response rates to light therapy were highest in the sub-SAD group (N=32, 78%), intermediate in the SAD group (N=113, 66%), and lowest in the ISR group (N=47, 51%). Limitations: This was a retrospective study of patients seen in a specialty clinic, although information was obtained in a standardized format. The light therapy trial had an open design so that placebo response could not be determined. Conclusions: There are differences in both the patterns of clinical symptoms and the response to light therapy in these three groups with winter depression. These results are consistent with a dual vulnerability hypothesis that considers these groups to result from interaction of separate factors for seasonality and depression. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The design of open-access elliptical cross-section magnet systems has recently come under consideration. Obtaining values for the forces generated within these unusual magnets is important to progress the designs towards feasible instruments. This paper presents a novel and flexible method for the rapid computation of forces within elliptical magnets. The method is demonstrated by the analysis of a clinical magnetic resonance imaging magnet of elliptical cross-section and open design. The analysis reveals the non-symmetric nature of the generated Maxwell forces, which are an important consideration, particularly in the design of superconducting systems.

AB  - Investigations have been camed out at the Textile Research Institute Thuringen-Vogtland e.v., Germany, to use water-soluble yarns and a combination of production processes to develop a range of embroideries that could be used both in the production of the embroidery backing fabric and the embroidery to create a transparent, three-dimensional effect in the finished product. As far as the backing was concerned, surfaces were worked with water-soluble and non-water-soluble yarns and woven using various types of linen and panama weaves. The material for the embroidery was chosen so that the yarns used were the same as in the fabric. Designs were created to match the woven fabric and were combined to produce new creative and functional effects such as a background fabric showing through an open design to produce a light/dark contrast and a special lace effect.

AB  - We describe the architecture, design, components, and functionality of the Distributed Mission Training Integrated Threat Environment (DMTITE) software. The DMTITE architecture and design support the development and run-time operation of computer-generated actors (CGAs) in distributed simulations. The architecture and design employ object-oriented techniques, component software, object frameworks, containerization, and rapid prototyping technologies. The DMTITE architecture and design consist of highly modular components where interdependences are well defined and minimized. DMTITE is an open architecture and open design, and most component and framework code is open source. The DMTITE architecture and design have been implemented (including all system components and frameworks) and currently support a number of types of computer-generated actors. The DMTITE architecture, design, and implementation are capable of supporting multiple reasoning, vehicle dynamics, skill level, and migration requirements for any type of CGA.

AB  - The effect of citalopram was investigated in 20 mentally retarded patients suffering from a depressive disorder characterized by alterations in the domains of affectivity, motivation, motor activity and vital signs. The study followed a baseline-controlled open design. Citalopram was started in a daily dosage of 20 mg that was kept unchanged for 6 weeks. Thereafter dosage was adjusted to maximally 60 mg per day. Treatment effects were assessed according to the Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGIS) after at least 6 months. In 12 of the 20 patients a moderate to marked improvement in all domains was observed upon treatment with 20-40 mg citalopram daily. Treatment for one year in the effective dose prevented recurrence of depressive symptomatology. Concomitant use of sedative anticonvulsants reduced responsiveness to treatment. No interactions were observed. It is concluded that citalopram is a well-tolerated, safe and effective antidepressant in mentally retarded subjects with depressive disorders. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - We describe the successful treatment of five patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TR-MDD) with a combination pharmacotherapy of pindolol, tryptophan and nefazodone. Five TR-MDD outpatients who had previously not responded to at least four different antidepressant medication trials were initiated on 300 mg/day of nefazodone, 7.5 mg/day of pindolol and 1 g/day of tryptophan. Pindolol doses remained the same throughout the 20 weeks, while tryptophan and nefazodone dosages were gradually increased to 8 g/day and 450 mg/day, respectively. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to evaluate outcome. By week 4, all cases demonstrated at least 50% decrease in HAM-D scores. At the end of the trial, the group mean HAM-D score had significantly decreased from 26.8 (± 1.9) to 1.8 (± 0.8) (p < 0.001). No significant adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that if serotonin availability and release is further enhanced by tryptophan in the presence of nefazodone and pindolol, an antidepressant effect may be produced in patients who are otherwise treatment-resistant. Due to limited sample size, an open design and an 'unusually' high successful efficacy rate of this preliminary study, controlled studies are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment strategy.

AB  - Postoperative pain resulting from surgical management, is a major contributor to postoperative problems, as patients are inhibited from coughing, taking deep breaths and mobilizing themselves. Treatment of pain has not only humanitarian value but also diminish the incidence and severity of postoperative complications. Postoperative pain relief with analgesic drugs is particularly important following surgery performed in young patients. This study was designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety and tolerance of a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug with a potent analgesic activity -dexibuprofen- for the management of postoperative acute pain in children. A total of 57 young patients were studied to determine prospectively the role of this therapy for the management of postoperative pain. Male and female patients aged between 12 and 15 years were assigned to receive orally dexibuprofen in an open design since the recovery from anesthesia until 7 days after, and the data were analyzed to determine the degree and duration of the analgesic response. From the present study, it becomes evident that dexibuprofen provides a significant decrease on the intensity of the postoperative acute pain, without adverse effects and good tolerance. The results obtained indicate that dexibuprofen is a potent analgesic drug that, in appropriate doses, can be administered safely along without toxicity, and thus this results provide strong evidence supporting the beneficial effects of the drug during the postoperative period.

AB  - Objective: Many patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) have dysfunctional eating behaviors. Conversely, many women with bulimia nervosa have marked winter worsening of mood and bulimic symptoms. Controlled studies of light therapy in SAD and in bulimia nervosa have shown beneficial effects on mood and binge/purge symptoms. We explored the clinical use of light therapy in women with SAD who also had comorbid bulimia nervosa. Method: Twenty-two female patients diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria with both bulimia nervosa and major depressive disorder with a seasonal (winter) pattern were treated with an open design, 4-week trial of light therapy (10,000 lux fluorescent light box with an ultraviolet filter, 30 to 60 minutes per day in the early morning). Patients were assessed before and after treatment with depression scales and with binge/purge diaries. Results: Light therapy resulted in significant improvement in mood, with a mean 56% reduction in 29-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores following treatment (p<.001). The frequency of binges and purges per week also signifieantly decreased (p < .001) from baseline by a mean of 46% and 36%, respectively. Two (9%) of 22 patients became abstinent of binge/purge episodes, compared with 10 (45%) of 22 patients who met criteria for remission of depressive symptoms. The light therapy was well tolerated by patients. Conclusion: These results suggest that therapeutic effects of light therapy on mood and bulimic symptoms in patients with SAD and comorbid bulimia nervosa are sustained over at least 4 weeks. However, the low abstinence rate in bulimic symptoms indicates that light therapy may be most effectively used as an adjunctive treatment to medications and/or psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa. ©Copyright 2001 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To compare the efficacy, safety, cost and effects on platelet aggregation of unfractionated heparin and low-molecular weight heparin in unstable angina patients. Patients and methods: Ninety-three patients with unstable angina were randomized to receive either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or enoxaparin in an open design clinical trial with blinded end point evaluation. The effects of the heparins on platelet aggregation were also compared. Results: The composite end point of myocardial infarction, cardiac death, recurrent angina and need for intervention was observed in 62% of patients treated with UFH and in 37% of patients treated with enoxaparin (RR 1.7, 95%CI 0.75 to 3.71, p = 0.04). There was no difference in the frequency of severity of adverse events. A cost-effectiveness analysis showed both the heparins to be similar. Platelet aggregation was inhibited to a greater extent by UFH when compared to enoxaparin. Conclusions: Enoxaparin appears to be superior in efficacy to UFH and similar to UFH in safety. No difference in costs was detected in this study. The greater inhibition of platelet aggregation observed in the case of UFH compared to enoxaparin indicates that there may be more bleeding complications with UFH.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was performed according to a pro-spective, randomized, open design. The aim was to test the efficacy of local application of nifedipine ointment in healing acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids. METHODS: Ninety - eight patients who gave their informed consent were recruited; they received clinical examination and anoscopy. A questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, pain, and concurrent use of analgesics was administered. Patients treated with nifedipine (n = 50) used topical 0.3 percent nifedipine and 1.5 percent lidocaine ointment every 12 hours for two weeks. The control group, consisting of 48 patients, received topical 1.5 percent lidocaine ointment during therapy. RESULTS: Results obtained were as follows: complete relief of pain in 43 patients (86 percent) of the nifedipine-treated group as opposed to 24 patients (50 percent) of the control group after 7 days of therapy (P < 0.01); oral analgesics were used by 4 patients (8 percent) in the nifedipine-treated group as opposed to 26 patients (54.1 percent) of the control group after 7 days of therapy (P < 0.01); and resolution of acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids was achieved after 14 days of therapy in 46 patients (92 percent) of the nifedipine-treated group, as opposed to 22 patients (45.8 percent) of the control group (P < 0.01). We did not observe any systemic side effect in patients treated with nifedipine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrates that the use of topical nifedipine, which at present is for treatment of cardiovascular disorders, is a reliable new option in the conservative treatment of thrombosed external hemorrhoids.

AB  - Background: Most proficiency testing (PT) programs operate with an open design in which clearly identified performance samples are distributed directly to participating laboratories on a shipping schedule announced in advance. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of assessing clinical laboratory performance for blood lead with an open PT by comparing its results with a double-blinded testing protocol. Methods: Aliquots from up to 72 blood lead performance pools from the New York State Department of Health and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene were disguised as routine patient specimens and submitted in two phases to up to 42 certified clinical laboratories for blood lead analysis. These 42 laboratories also received aliquots of the same performance samples for blood lead analysis directly from the "open" PT program provider. Results: Data reported under blind and open strategies were scored against acceptable target ranges using the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88) criteria established for blood lead, i.e., ± 0.19 μmol/L (± 4 μg/dL) or ± 10%, whichever is greater. Performance differences between the strategies were also assessed. We found that 17.7% of all blind PT results were classified as unacceptable compared with only 4.5% of open PT results (P <0.001). In phase 1, 13 of 22 laboratories (60%) exhibited a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) between their blind and open PT performances, although for 6 laboratories the poorer blind performance may not necessarily have led to unsuccessful PT participation under CLIA '88 criteria. Seven (32%) laboratories had unsuccessful aggregate performance (<80%) under blind testing while maintaining successful performance in open testing. Of these seven, two had gross discrepancies motivating further investigation. Conclusions: The data suggest that although @O60% of clinical laboratories make special efforts to improve analytical performance on open PT samples relative to performance achieved for routine patient specimens, in most cases the differences are clinically insignificant and would not likely affect cumulative PT performance. Occasional use of blind PT may deter the inclination to treat performance samples more carefully. © 2001 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB  - Background. MRI-guided procedures have previously been limited by technical difficulties, including the need for MRI-compatible instruments, slow image acquisition time, and the closed nature of conventional MRI scanners. The development of open configuration MRI systems with in-room, contemporaneous imaging has greatly increased the potential for MRI-guided interventional procedures. We evaluate our clinical experience applying this technology to the head and neck. Methods. An open design 0.2T magnet combined with an in-room monitor was used for 24 MRI-guided needle localization procedures in the head and neck. Success of the procedures was based on the ability to accurately position the instrument in the target region to allow biopsy or treatment. Results. In all 24 cases placement of the instrument within the target tissue was successful. Conclusion. MRI-guided needle- localization procedures in an open design magnet with in-room, contemporaneous image monitoring offer advantages over previous conventional interventional MRI systems by allowing interactive guidance with near real- time imaging feedback. As a result, procedure time is reduced and accuracy of instrument positioning is increased. (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this report is to analyze the results of a 1-year clinical study of antioxidant therapy in the treatment of pain and recurrent inflammatory episodes in patients with chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis, using a prospective, descriptive, pre-post, open design. The intensity of pain at the beginning and end of treatment was assessed with a visual analogue scale, and these results along with the number of hospital admissions for pancreatic disease were analyzed. METHODS: we studied patients with acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis who had suffered from pain or acute inflammatory episodes the year before the beginning of treatment with a complex containing L-methionine, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E and organic selenium. RESULTS: of 10 patients with chronic pancreatitis who completed treatment, the intensity of pain was reduced considerably in 9 (61.5 ± 21.5 mm vs. 19.6 ± 26.1 mm, p = 0.03), and pain was completely absent in 3 of these patients. Twelve patients who completed treatment had fewer hospital admissions during the year with antioxidant treatment than they had had during the previous year (1.5 ± 1.62 vs. 0.25 ± 0.45 admissions, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: antioxidant treatment had a positive effect in patients who suffered from pancreatic inflammatory pain, and its effectiveness should be tested before more aggressive and costlier treatments are considered.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were 2-fold: (1) to examine the association of pharmacy closures with prescription drug use by Medicaid recipients in Iowa; and (2) to evaluate how drug utilization patterns differ between patients whose pharmacies closed and patients whose pharmacies remained open. Design: A 2-group pretest-posttest study of Medicaid enrollees who may have been affected by pharmacy closures. Prescription medication use during the periods preceding and after pharmacy closures was compared. A comparison group was used to account for extraneous factors. Patients and Methods: Sixteen community pharmacies were selected from a pool of pharmacies that closed during 1994; 1092 patients were identified as the main users of these pharmacies, and a comparison group of 3491 patients whose main pharmacies had not closed also was identified. The average number of each patient's prescription claims for the 6 months preceding closing and the 6 months after closing was computed. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine whether any association existed between pharmacy closures and the use of prescription drugs. Results: Patients whose pharmacies closed during 1994 had fewer prescription claims after the closings than before the closings. In contrast, patients whose pharmacies remained open had more prescription claims. This difference remains statistically significant after controlling for other factors, such as patient demographics and health status. Conclusions: A decrease in prescription drug use was associated with pharmacy closures. Attention should be directed to patient access to prescription medications in rural areas, as relatively more pharmacies close in rural areas.

AB  - Analyses are made of procurement strategies capable of leading to cost reduction and higher quality through the contribution of specialized firms. An exploration is made of the literature concerning the procurement of manufactured goods and progress by analysing two case studies: the East Bridge of the Storebælt link and the Grand Canal Maritime bridge. Both these projects adopted procurement systems that led to a learning process capable of enhancing performance and reducing overall costs. It is evident that the success of learning-oriented procurement strategies relies on two major conditions. First, the client’s tender must be issued with an open design demanding an active contribution from the firms involved in the construction process. Second, the firms bidding for the job must be able to manage two distinct sets of skills: the technical skills relating to a specific production process and the ability to connect these skills to the client’s needs through a co-design process, or what is known as the strategic intermediation function. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - Current evidence suggests that angiotensin II may be involved in the regulation of renal erythropoietin (EPO) production. The present study assessed the role of angiotensin II (A II) in different doses in the control of EPO production in humans. In a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled open design, 60 healthy male volunteers received a 6-h intravenous infusion of: placebo (placebo, electrolyte solution), a pressor dose of A II (1-3 μg/min; A II press), a combination of a pressor dose of A II and the selective AT1-receptor blocker losartan, 50 mg (A II press + L), a subpressor dose of A II (0.0375-0.15 μg/min; A II subpress) and a combination of a subpressor dose of A II and losartan (A II subpress + L). A II press treatment resulted in a significant increase of the maximum EPO concentration (C(maxEPO), 41% higher versus placebo) and the amount of EPO produced in 24 h (AUC(EPO(0-24 h)), 61% larger versus placebo), A II subpress treatment increased C(maxEPO) (35% higher versus placebo) and AUC(EPO(0-24 h)) (34% larger versus placebo). A II press + L and A-II subpress + L treatments did not significantly increase C(maxEPO) and AUC(EPO(0-24 h)) compared to placebo. A II affects EPO production in a dose-dependent manner. The signal seems to be mediated via AT1-receptors. A II appears to be one modulator EPO production in humans.

AB  - The influence of keyboard design on hand position, typing productivity and keyboard preference was evaluated by comparing two segmented alternative designs with the linear standard keyboard. The FIXED alternative keyboard featured a split angle of 12° and a moderate lateral inclination angle of 10°. The adjustable OPEN alternative keyboard was used with a 15° split setting, which resulted in a marked 42° of demiboard lateral inclination. Sixteen typists, who completed 10 h of training on both alternative keyboards, were videotaped while typing set texts on all three keyboards. Forearm and wrist angles based on threedimensional video analyses were significantly different (p< 0.05) among the three designs tested. Both alternative keyboards placed the forearm and wrist closer to neutral positions than did the standard keyboard. While the OPEN keyboard reduced pronation, it simultaneously increased radial deviation. The FIXED keyboard kept the forearm in moderate pronation and the wrist closer to neutral. More time was spent in neutral and moderate ranges of wrist motion when subjects typed on the FIXED compared with the other two designs. With respect to the standard keyboard, typing productivity was reduced by 10% on the FIXED and 20% on the OPEN designs. No significant difference in preference was found between the standard and FIXED keyboards, both of which were preferred over the OPEN. It was concluded that, of the three keyboards evaluated, the FIXED design incorporated moderate changes to the standard keyboard. These changes promoted a more natural hand position while typing thereby reducing the potential for cumulative trauma disorders of the wrist. In addition, the FIXED design preserved a reasonable level of productivity and was well accepted by users. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Aims. To establish whether enantioselective metabolism of racemic (rac)-salbutamol occurs in the lungs by determining its enantiomeric disposition following inhalation, in the absence and presence of oral charcoal, compared with that following the oral and intravenous routes. Methods. Fifteen healthy subjects (eight male) were randomized into an open design, crossover study. Plasma and urine salbutamol enantiomer concentrations were measured for 24 h following oral (2 mg) with or without oral charcoal (to block oral absorption), inhaled (MDI; 1200 μg) with or without oral charcoal and intravenous (500 μg) rac-salbutamol. Systemic exposure (plasma AUC(0,∞) and urinary excretion (AU24 (h)) or both enantiomers were calculated, and relative exposure to (R)-salbutamol both in plasma (AUC((R)-)/AUC((S)-)) and urine (Au((R)-)/Au((S)-)) was derived for each route. Relative exposure after the inhaled with charcoal and oral routes were compared with the intravenous route. Results. AUC((R)-)/AUC((S)-) [geometric mean (95% CI)] was similar following the intravenous [0.32 (0.28, 0.36)] and inhaled with charcoal rates [0.29 (0.24, 0.36); P = 0.046], but was far lower following oral dosing [0.05 (0.03, 0.07); P &lt; 0.001]. Similar results were found when relative exposure was analysed using Au24 (h). Conclusions. These results show no evidence of significant enantioselective presystemic metabolism in the lungs, whilst confirming it in the gut and systemic circulation, indicating that the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers are present in similar quantities in the airways following inhaled rac-salbutamol.

AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence shows the efficacy of the γ- aminobutyric acid (GABA(B)) receptor agonist baclofen in reducing alcohol intake in rats, but no studies have been performed in alcoholics. In the present preliminary study we investigated the effect of short-term baclofen administration on craving for alcohol, ethanol intake, and abstinence from alcohol in alcoholic individuals. Methods: Ten male current alcoholic individuals were admitted to the study. Baclofen was orally administered for 4 weeks, at a dose of 15 mg/day refracted in three times per day for the first 3 days, with the dose increased to 30 mg/day for the remaining 27 days. Each subject was checked as an outpatient every week for the 4 weeks; at each visit (T0-T4) craving level was evaluated by the Alcohol Craving Scale (ACS), and abstinence from alcohol was assessed based on the individual's self- evaluation, family member inter- view, and the main biological markers of alcohol abuse. A self-reported-alcohol intake was recorded as the mean number of standard drinks consumed per day. Results: Nine subjects completed the study; of these, two subjects continued to drink alcohol although they substantially reduced their daily drinks in the first week of treatment, whereas seven maintained abstinence throughout the experimental period. Craving was significantly reduced from the first week of the drug administration (p < 0.01) and remained so throughout the entire treatment period. Participants also reported that obsessional thinking about alcohol disappeared. Values of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, and mean cellular volume significantly decreased by the end of the study. Tolerability was fair in all participants; headache; vertigo, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypotension, increased sleepiness, and tiredness were present as side effects in the first stage of the treatment. No participants showed craving for the drug. Conclusions: With the limitations of the low number of individuals evaluated and the open design, this preliminary clinical study supports the preclinical evidence on the effect of baclofen in reducing alcohol intake. The anticraving properties of the drug suggest a possible role of baclofen in the treatment of individuals with alcohol problems.

AB  - Background: Involvement of cholinergic pathways may explain visual hallucinations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and diffuse lewy body disease (DLBD), and may account for cognitive dysfunctions characterizing these disorders and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Methods: We studied the effects of 3 months of therapy with donepezil (5 mg/day) on cognition, hallucinosis, and extrapyramidal symptoms in 5 patients with PD and hallucinosis, 5 patients with DLBD and in 5 patients with PSP, following an open design and using specific rating scales (UPDRS, Parkinson psychosis rating scale, GDS, caregiver assessment, MMSE, and cognitive tests for frontal disturbances). Results: No changes in cognition, burden for caregivers and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms were observed in patients with PSP. Visual hallucinosis improved in DLBD with no changes in severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. In 3 out of 5 PD patients donepezil induced an improvement in visual hallucinations, but in 2 of them motor symptoms significantly worsened. Conclusions: Central acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of visual hallucinations in DLBD and PD. However, a careful follow-up of PD patients is mandatory given the possibility of a decisive worsening of motor symptoms. Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of these drugs in PSP.

AB  - Aims. In the Second European Stroke Prevention Study headaches associated with dipyridamole frequently (8% of patients taking dipyridamole or dipyridamole plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) vs 2% of patients taking ASA or placebo) led to discontinuation of therapy. We have now used data from a recent trial comparing the bioequivalence of two formulations of the fixed combination of 200 mg dipyridamole in an extended release formulation and 25 mg ASA to explore predicting factors for headaches associated with this drug combination. Methods. The bioequivalence trial employed a two-way crossover, randomised, open design. Trial medication was given for two periods of five days separated by a 72 h washout period. Statistical methods were employed to explore the prevalence, the time course, and the relation to individual pharmacokinetic parameters of treatment associated headaches. Results. Headache episodes, being mostly mild and transient, rapidly declined from 67% of the volunteers on the first day of treatment to 3% on the final days of treatment (days 4-5 of the second period). During the first days the prevalence of the headaches peaked 2-3 h after the morning administration, which coincided with the peak of the plasma concentrations of dipyridamole. The occurrence of headaches was not related to interindividual differences of the pharmacokinetic parameters. Conclusions. The rapid decrease in the incidence of headaches over time implies that most patients quickly develop tolerance to dipyridamole-associated headaches. Appropriate information given to the patient when prescribing and dispensing dipyridamole/ASA may reduce early withdrawals from treatment and increase compliance.

AB  - Although some studies suggest that asthma deteriorates after reducing inhaled steroids, results of long-term studies indicate that this might not be true for all patients. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of the detection of a plateau on the concentration-response curves to inhaled methacholine as a marker for safely reducing the dose of inhaled budesonide in asthmatic patients who are well-controlled with a moderately high dose of this inhaled steroid. A total of 46 patients with moderate asthma, well- controlled for at least 6 months by treatment with 800 μg budesonide daily, were included in the study. Subjects were treated for a 2-week run-in period with their usual dose of budesonide. At the end of the run-in, all subjects were challenged with methacholine (0.095-200 mg·mL-1). Plateau responses, median effective concentration values, slopes and provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) values were measured. For the subsequent 12 weeks, patients were treated in an open design with budesonide at a reduced dose (200 μg once daily), and were asked to record their peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the morning and in the evening. In addition, asthma symptoms and use of rescue terbutaline were recorded in diaries. Plateaus were present in 24 patients, whereas 22 subjects showed concentration-response curves without evidence of a plateau. Ten patients in the nonplateau group deteriorated after reducing inhaled budesonide, compared to one patient in the plateau group (p=0.002). In the nonplateau group, FEV1 decreased from a baseline value of 3.28±0.19 L to 2.94±0.20 L at week 12 (p&lt;0.0001). Likewise, morning PEF decreased from 419±19 L·min-1 at baseline to 394±19 L·min-1 at week 12 (p=0.02). By contrast, these variables remained unchanged in the plateau group. In conclusion, in asthmatic patients, well-controlled with a moderately high dose of budesonide, the detection of a plateau on the concentration-response curve to inhaled methacholine may be used as a marker for safely reducing the corticosteroid dose.

AB  - Objective: To investigate variations in bone mineral density during lactation and throughout the 12 months after scheduled cessation of lactation in relation to the resumption of ovarian function. Methods: Three hundred eight mothers who decided to lactate were scheduled to fully breast-feed for 6 months, followed by a 1-month weaning period, and then suppress lactation with cabergoline. Their bone mineral density variations were compared with those of a control group of nonlactating mothers during the first 18 months postpartum. Half the lactating women were given daily oral calcium supplements of 1 g in an open design. Results: There was a significant progressive decrease in bone mineral density in lactating women over the first 6 months, followed by recovery of bone mass up to levels that at 18 months were higher than baseline. In nonlactating women, bone mineral density increased progressively after delivery, and at 18 months postpartum had increased by 1.1-1.9% compared with baseline. Compared with lactating women who resumed menstruation within 5 months of delivery, breast-feeding mothers with longer amenorrhea initially lost more bone, but they also gained significantly more bone after resumption of menses, so there were no differences at 18 months postpartum. Oral calcium supplementation decreased bone loss, but had only a transient effect. Conclusion: A scheduled lactation period of 6 months, followed by a 1-month weaning period, allowed bone mineral density to reach higher values compared with early postpartum, regardless of calcium supplementation and duration of postpartum amenorrhea.

AB  - Background and Aim: Since functional properties in the vasculature of hypercholesterolemic subjects are impaired, a six-month pravastatin treatment (20 mg/die) was tested in an open design, on the impaired unstimulated forearm arterial compliance (Un-FAC(AUC)) of 14 asymptomatic type IIa familial hypercholesterolemic patients. In order to evaluate whether FAC(AUC) changes might be related to the extent of cholesterol reduction achieved, this evaluation was carried out in five severely hypercholesterolemic patients, undergoing LDL-apheresis. Methods and Results: Arterial functional properties, ie FAC(AUC) responses to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN-FAC(AUC)) and acetylcholine (ACh-FAC(AUC), four patients) and the effects on rest and peak forearm blood flow and vascular resistance were evaluated on the non-dominant arm using plethysmographic methods, that also allow the direct assessment of the non-linear "compliance-blood pressure" curve. Selective LDL-apheresis was performed by using a dextransulphate column. Pravastatin effectively lowered plasma total (-16%, p=0.002) and LDL cholesterol levels (-22%, p=0.006 vs baseline). Rest and peak flow, basal and post ischemic vascular resistance were not affected as well as Un-FAC(AUC) and GTN-FAC(AUC). However, in the four hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing ACh infusion, there was an improvement in the ACh-FAC(AUC) of borderline statistical significativity (p=0.056). LDL-apheresis reduced plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels by 55% and 59%, without affecting blood pressure. In this series of five patients Un-FAC(AUC) increased, the UnFAC(AUC) rise being inversely related to the absolute reduction of plasma total (r=0.92, p&lt;0.05) and LDL cholesterol (r=0.89, p&lt;0.05) levels. Conclusions: In hypercholesterolemic patients a short-term hypocholesterolemic treatment with pravastatin, although able to improve the lipid profile, cannot alter significantly blood flow, vascular resistance, Un-FAC(AUC) and GTN-FAC(AUC). A possible selective improvement in the ACh-receptor-activated signal transduction pathway has been observed and the importance of a drastic reduction of cholesterol concentrations in order to affect the Un-FAC(AUC) is suggested.

AB  - Objective: To study the effect of octreotide on glucagon-like peptide (7-36) amide (GLP-1) and insulin secretion in patients with pituitary tumors during preoperative treatment and in healthy subjects. Design: Open design prospective clinical study. Methods: Eighteen patients with pituitary macroadenomas (13 clinically nonfunctioning (NFA: 11/13 had GH insufficiency), 5 GH secreting (GHA)) received preoperative octreotide treatment: 3x100 μg/day s.c. for 3 months, and 3x500 μg/day s.c. for an additional 3 months. Seven healthy subjects received (for ethical reasons) only 3x100 μg/day for 10 days. A standardized meal (St-M) test, oral glucose test (oGTT) and i.v. glucose test (ivGTT) were done before octreotide therapy, on days 1, 2 and 3 (D1,2,3), after 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6) of octreotide treatment in the patients, and before treatment, on D1,2,3 and on D8,9,10 of octreotide treatment in the healthy subjects. Serum GLP-1, insulin and GH as well as plasma glucose were determined for 180 min (oGTT, St-M) or 120 min (ivGTT). Results: Pretreatment fasting GLP-1 concentrations as well as integrated responses (area under the curve 0-180 min) to oGTT and St-M were not significantly different between NFA, GHA and healthy subjects. During the oGTT, octreotide initially almost abolished the early (0-60 min) and diminished the late (60-180 min) GLP-1 and insulin responses in patients and healthy subjects. At M6 integrated insulin responses had significantly recovered, while the increase in GLP-1 response failed to reach significance (GLP-1: 56.5% of pretreatment at D2 versus 93.5% at M6 and 41.2 versus 63.1% in NFA and GHA respectively; insulin: 50.2 versus 71.2% and 35.5 versus 70.4%). An escape of GLP-1 and insulin in healthy subjects (D2 versus D9) was not significant. Intestinal glucose absorption was apparently not reduced, since the early glucose rise was similar before and during octreotide treatment. During the St-M the GLP-1 and insulin responses were similarly suppressed by octreotide and recovered during ongoing treatment (GLP-1: 49.6% of pretreatment at D1 versus 79.0% at M6 in NFA and 46.9 versus 52.9% in GHA. Insulin: 27.6 versus 83.9% and 23.5 versus 54.4%). The escape was significant in NFA but not in GHA. In the healthy subjects the escape was already significant on D8 (GLP-1: 39.5% of pretreatment at D1 versus 68.3% at D8; insulin: 36.6 versus 53.8%). During the ivGTT GLP-1 did not increase. The early insulin response (0-30 min) was abolished by octreotide, followed by a reduced peak at 60 min. The reduction of the integrated insulin response during ivGTT was similar to that during oGTT. An insulin escape reached significance only for NFA (52.6% of pretreatment at D3 versus 66.7% at M6). Glucose tolerance (K(G) value) deteriorated and did not improve during ongoing treatment. Octreotide suppressed the median GH concentration (8 h profile) of the GHA patients from 10.3 μg/l (pretreatment) to 5.8, 6.3 and 3.7 μg/l at D4, M3 and M6 with no escape. GH was 1.5 μg/l postoperatively. Conclusions: Octreotide abolishes the early and diminishes the late GLP-1 and insulin responses to oGTT and St-M in NFA and GHA patients and in healthy subjects. In contrast to GH, both hormones partially escape from suppression during ongoing therapy. During treatment with our conventional octreotide doses suppression of insulin secretion is maximal. Under these conditions an effect of the additional loss of GLP-1 is not apparent. Basal GLP-1 concentrations and integrated responses to oGTT and St-M were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with GH excess or GH insufficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Many GH deficient (GHD) patients have impaired glucose tolerance and GH substitution in these patients has caused deleterious effects on glucose tolerance with hyperinsulinaemia. This further impairment of glucose tolerance might be due to an unphysiologically high dose of GH. Whether such a deterioration can be avoided by an optimal GH replacement dose is not known. In most previous studies, the GH dose was calculated according to body weight or body surface area and not adjusted according to the serum IGF-I response. DESIGN. The study was of open design and investigations were performed before the start of GH substitution and after nine months of treatment. The GH dose was adjusted according to the response in serum IGF- I, and in patients with sub-normal serum IGF-I levels (all but two) we aimed for a serum IGF-I level in the middle of the normal range. The median GH dose at the end of the study was 0.14 IU/kg/week. PATIENTS. Ten patients, eight males and two females, with childhood onset GHD were examined. Their median age was 27 years (range 21-28). MEASUREMENTS. Overnight and 24-h fasting levels of glucose, insulin and IGFBP-1 were measured. Directly after the 24- h fast an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), with measurements of glucose, insulin and IGFBP-1 was performed. An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed after overnight fasting. Body composition was measured with bio-impedance analysis (BIA) and quality of life was assessed using a self-rating questionnaire, Qol-AGHDA. RESULTS. After GH treatment, there were no significant changes in glucose tolerance, measured by overnight and 24-h fasting levels of glucose, insulin and IGFBP-1, an oral glucose tolerance test (after 24-h fasting) and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (after overnight fasting). Percentage fat mass and BMI correlated negatively with both the 24 h fasting IGFBP-1 levels and the IGFBP-1 responses after the OGTT. All patients decreased their percentage of fat mass measured by BIA [median -2.9%; range -1.0-(-6.6); P=0.005]. The administered GH dose correlated negatively with the relative change in whole body resistance (r=- 0.66; P= 0.04). All, but one of the patients improved their quality of life score after GH therapy. CONCLUSIONS. In a group of young patients with childhood onset GH deficiency, 9 months of treatment with a low GH dose (median 0.14 IU/kg/week) caused no significant deterioration of glucose tolerance. The strong negative associations between BMI or percentage fat mass and IGFBP-1 suggest that serum IGFBP-1 is more closely related than insulin to body composition in GH deficient patients. It is important to consider which critical endpoints should determine the GH dose. We would suggest that, apart for normalizing the serum IGF-I level, another main endpoint should be normalization of, or at least avoidance of any deterioration in glucose tolerance.

AB  - Two procedures, the Closed Design and the Open Design, are presented that can be used by clinicians to accumulate data to help current patients. The two procedures have different objectives and work in different circumstances. Both procedures are sequential: what happens next is determined by what has happened up until now. The Closed Design concludes early as possible while the Open Design never terminates, thus helping all patients.

AB  - Low temperature depletion capacitance-voltage data, taken from a novel open design of surface superlattice fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, are compared with two theoretical models. These assume either that the Fermi level on the free semiconductor surface is pinned, or that the surface charge state is unaltered (frozen) when the superlattices are biased. The data are in much better agreement with the frozen surface model. © 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - Depression is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, but tricyclic compounds are not well tolerated and newer antidepressants have not been studied. Effects of 150-400 mg/day of moclobemide, a reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitor, were studied in a 3-month open design in 10 MS patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed depression. Nine patients reached complete remission. No adverse effects were noted. Four patients reported side effects including nausea and insomnia. The authors conclude that moclobemide is a well tolerated and efficient treatment for depression comorbid with MS.

AB  - Smoke control design by using air curtains in spaces adjacent to `open-design' atria was evaluated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The design mechanical installs systems for discharging air vertically downward (commonly known as an air curtain) to isolate spaces adjacent to the atrium for preventing smoke spreading to those areas. Performance of the design was evaluated by carrying out two sets of CFD simulations with heat release rates of the fire of 1 MW and 5 MW. An atrium of length 10 m, width 10 m and height 10 m with an adjacent area 6 m above the atrium floor was considered. Air speed of 1 ms-1 to 10 ms-1 discharged vertically downward, corresponding to volumetric flow rates of thirty-six air changes per hour to 360 air changes per hour of atrium volume space were studied.

AB  - Recent studies have outlined the role of bisphosphonates, and particularly clodronate, as potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases. On this basis, we carried out an open, non comparative pilot trial to evaluate the effects of clodronate on synovial fluid concentration of some inflammatory mediators (prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4 and tromboxane B2) after intra-articular, repeated administrations in 20 patients (7 males and 13 females) with synovitis secondary to knee osteoarthritis. At the end of the treatment period, statistically significant reductions (p < 0.05) of spontaneous pain and pain on active movement, evaluated by means of a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), were reported. Linear regression analysis showed that the decrease of pain was correlated with the bisphosphonate induced reduction of prostaglandin E2 levels. These results, in spite of the limitation due to the open design of the trial suggest a possible role of bisphosphonates in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

AB  - The study was performed on 14 healthy volunteers in order to compare the pharmacokinetics and hence assess the bioequivalence of two different tablet formulations of diltiazem administered orally. The study was carried out after single doses (60 mg) and repeated doses (60 mg three times a day for six days and 60 mg on the seventh day) according to a randomised, cross-over, open design. The pharmacokinetics parameters AUC(0-∞) (ng h/ml), T(max) (h) and C(max) (ng/ml) were calculated for the two formulations after a single dose, while AUC(t1-t2) (= AUC for a repetitive dose interval or dosing cycle, ng h/ml) and PTF (peak trough fluctuation) were calculated after repeated doses. The bioequivalence assessment was the shortest 90% confidence interval for the ratio (difference) of expected medians in the respective bioequivalence range (0.80-1.20). The results of this study show that, after either a single dose or repeated doses of test or reference formulations of diltiazem, the pharmacokinetics of the two formulations are similar. The ratios of AUC on day 1 (for single-dose treatment) and on day 7 (for repeated-dose treatment), and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals demonstrate bioequivalence between the two formulations of diltiazem within the accepted range of 0.80-1.20 (80-120%).

AB  - Elevated blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Recent studies show that lowering cholesterol reduces the risk of vascular disease, but the precise mechanisms for vascular improvement are not fully understood. Furthermore, it is not known whether the beneficial effects of cholesterol lowering extend to the skin microvasculature. In this unrandomized, open design study, we used iontophoresis and laser Doppler flowmetry to examine forearm skin perfusion in hypercholesterolaemic patients with PAOD before and after cholesterol-lowering therapy with fluvastatin. Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation were measured following skin iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), respectively. Before cholesterol-lowering, vascular responses to ACh and SNP were reduced significantly in patients compared with responses in control subjects (p<0.001 and p<0.05, ANOVA, respectively). Fluvastatin therapy (40 mg/day) for 24 weeks significantly reduced total cholesterol (7.3 ± 0.3 to 6.0 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (5.4 ± 0.5 to 4.2 ± 0.4 mmol/l, p < 0.01). Vasodilatation to SNP was significantly improved at week 24 (p < 0.05). In patients with hypercholesterolaemia and PAOD, cholesterol- lowering with statin therapy significantly improved endothelium-independent vascular responses to SNP in skin microvessels. The application of the non- invasive techniques of iontophoresis and laser Doppler flowmetry may provide useful markers for the assessment of microvascular function in this group of patients.

AB  - Purpose: Radiotherapy of the breast is normally performed in a supine position, so conventional prone magnetic resonance (MR) mammography is unsuitable for radiotherapy planning purposes. No dedicated supine breast coil is yet available, limiting the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this area. A technique has been developed on a 0.2T open scanner to produce breast images suitable for radiotherapy planning. Method: The single-sided supine breast technique uses a similar patient position to that for radiotherapy treatment. A small coil is used as a side-on loop over the patient's shoulder that allows the arms to be raised and abducted and a flat tabletop insert imitates the treatment tabletops. The open design of the scanner allows the breast to be positioned in the field centre, increasing the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Twenty patients undergoing routine radiotherapy of the breast were referred for MRI scans in addition to the routine radiotherapy planning. MR markers were placed on the patient's skin over tattoos corresponding to treatment field borders. A high bandwidth T1W sequence was performed in transverse, sagittal and coronal planes. Images were assessed by the clinical oncologist to determine whether all breast tissue was included within the treatment field. Results: Images of good diagnostic quality were produced in reasonable scan times. Glandular breast tissue was well demonstrated, particularly in younger, pre-menopausal women. Surgical cavities and enlarged lymph nodes were also well demonstrated. MR markers allowed accurate delineation of the treatment field. Conclusion: The single-sided supine technique produces high quality breast images contributing valuable information for treatment planning and assessment. MR provides better discrimination between breast and surrounding fatty tissue than fluoroscopy.

AB  - Purpose: A system for digital integration of an open MR scanner (0.23 T, Figure 1) in therapy simulation and 3D radiation treatment planning is described. Method: MR images were acquired using the body coil and various positioning and immobilization aids. A gradient echo sequence (TR/TE 320 ms/24 ms) was used to create axial and coronal data sets. Image distortions were measured and corrected using phantom measurements (Figure 2) and specially developed software. Results: Maximal and mean distortions of the MR images could be reduced from 19 mm to 8.2 mm and from 2.7 mm to 0.7 mm, respectively (Figure 3 to 5, Table 1). Coronal MR images were recalculated in fan beam projection for use at the therapy simulator. Tumor and organ conturs were transferred from the MR image to the digitally acquired and corrected simulator image using a landmark matching algorithm (Figure 6 and 7). For 3D treatment planning, image fusion of axial MR images with standard CT planning images was performed using a landmark matching algorithm, as well (Figure 8). Representative cases are shown to demonstrate potential applications of the system. Conclusion: The described system enables the integration of the imaging information from an open MR system in therapy simulation and 3D treatment planning. The low-field MR scanner is an attractive adjunct for the radiooncologist because of the open design and the low costs.

AB  - Objective: The objective of these studies was to examine the clinical pharmacokinetics and safety of zanamivir, an influenza A and B virus neuraminidase inhibitor, when administered to healthy volunteers. Design: The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of zanamivir administered by a number of routes were assessed in randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies. The study of absolute oral bioavailability had an open design. Study participants: The participants in these studies were healthy male or female volunteers. Interventions: Zanamivir was administered as single or multiple doses by the intravenous, oral, inhaled (nebuliser and dry powder) and intranasal routes. Serum and urine samples were obtained for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters, and nasal washes and throat gargles were performed to assess drug concentrations in the nose and throat. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events, vital signs and laboratory parameters. Results: Zanamivir was well tolerated at all doses by all routes; no serious adverse events were reported. The kinetics of zanamivir were linear with single intravenous doses up to 600 mg, and there was no evidence of modification in the kinetics after repeated twice-daily administration. Approximately 90% of zanamivir was excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination of zanamivir from the serum was a first-order process with a half-life of approximately 2 hours and, at 16L, the volume of distribution was similar to that of extracellular water. The absolute oral bioavailability of zanamivir was low, averaging 2%. After intranasal or oral inhaled administration, a median of 10 to 20% of the dose was systemically absorbed, with maximum serum concentrations generally reached within 1 to 2 hours. The median serum half-life ranged between 2.5 and 5.05 hours, suggesting that the elimination rate is limited by absorption. There was no evidence of modification in the kinetics after repeated inhaled administration. Conclusions: Zanamivir is a well tolerated drug. The low level of absorption of the drug after inhaled administration results in low serum concentrations, and therefore there is modest systemic exposure to zanamivir after inhalation. Zanamivir is not metabolised, and the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions is very low.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - To establish whether the short-acting insulin analog lispro can be successfully implemented in long-term intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes, and if so, what its effects are on glycemic control and frequency and awareness of hypoglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We randomized 56 type 1 diabetic patients to treatment with either lispro (n = 28) or human regular insulin (Hum-R; n = 28) as mealtime insulin for 1 year (open design, parallel groups). Lispro was injected at mealtime and Hum-R was given 10-40 min before meals (bedtime NPH was continued on both occasions). With lispro, NPH was added at breakfast (~70/30), lunch (~60/40), and supper (~80/20) (mixing percentage of lispro/NPH) to optimize premeal and bedtime blood glucose. RESULTS - Total daily insulin units were no different in the two treatment groups, but with lispro ~30% less short-acting insulin at meals and ~30% more NPH was needed versus HumR (P < 0.05). The bedtime NPH dosage was no different. With lispro + NPH, the mean daily blood glucose was lower than with Hum-R (8.0 ± 0.1 vs. 8.8 ± 0.1 mmol/l; P < 0.05), HbA(1c) was lower (6.34 ± 0.10 vs. 6.71 ± 0.11%, mean value over 1 year; P < 0.002), and hypoglycemia (blood glucose ≤3.8 mmol/l) was less frequent (7.4 ± 0.5 vs. 11.5 ± 0.7 episodes/patient-month) and tended to occur more within 90 min after meals than in the postabsorptive state (P < 0.05 vs. Hum- R). After 1 year, plasma adrenaline and symptom responses to experimental, stepped hypoglycemia improved with lispro and were closer to the responses of 12 nondiabetic control subjects versus Hum-R both in terms of thresholds and magnitude (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS - We concluded that mealtime injection of lispro + NPH improves the 24-h blood glucose and the percentage HbA(1c) as compared with Hum-R. The improvement can be maintained long term. Intensive therapy with lispro + NPH results in less frequent hypoglycemia and better awareness and counterregulation of hypoglycemia.

AB  - Frameless MR-guided procedures have had limited application using conventional closed magnets, due largely to the technical difficulties involved. As a result of in-room MR image-monitoring capabilities, new open- design magnets now allow frameless stereotaxis using contemporaneous imaging to guide more invasive procedures. We evaluate our clinical experience with this new technique. An open-design 0.2 T magnet (Siemens OPEN) combined with an in-room monitor was used for 33 frameless MR-guided procedures (aspiration cytology, biopsy, and/or treatment) in a variety of locations in the head, neck, spine, brain, pelvis, and abdomen. Success of the procedure was based on the ability to accurately position the instrument in the target region to allow biopsy and/or treatment. The open-design magnet allowed the physician to directly access the patient for frameless stereotaxis as the procedure was performed. The in-room monitor provided contemporaneous imaging feedback during the procedure for successful placement of the instrument in the target region. Twenty-eight biopsy and five treatment procedures were performed. In all cases the technique resulted in successful placement of the instrument within the target tissue to complete the procedure. MR-guided procedures using contemporaneous imaging frameless stereotaxis are possible in an open- design magnet with in-room image monitoring and offer exciting possibilities for further development.

AB  - SEMATECH, a US based consortium of ten major semiconductor manufacturers, is developing a comprehensive system for the design of ICs below .25 μm, which exploits hierarchy, constraint directives, incremental processing, and concurrent design and analysis. This development of SEMATECH's Chip Hierarchical Design System (CHDS) includes major technological investments in algorithms for design planning, parasitic extraction, and signal integrity verification. The foundation of CHDS is an open design model and API upon which these tools are integrated. This model must support a number of critical requirements including: A data scope that includes connectivity, electrical data, physical data, and timing; Design hierarchy and incremental access to data; A central delay architecture; Efficient, application-selected views of the data. This paper introduces the Integrated Data Model technology being used for CHDS Beta development and its use as the basis for the design of an industry-open specification called the CHDS Technical Data Specification (CHDStd).

AB  - The present study set out to define the possible effect of reduced glutathione (GSH), the substrate of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), a free radical inactivating enzyme, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Thirty-two patients affected by definite ALS seen in our institution between August 1993 and July 1994 were admitted to the study. The effect of GSH was studied in an open, crossover, randomized study. GSH was given at the dose of 600 mg each day intramuscularly for 12 weeks. The patients, taken sequentially, were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group received the drug while the second received only symptomatic therapies for 12 weeks. After a week of washout, the second group received GSH and the first only symptomatic therapies for 12 weeks. The rate of progression of the diseases was compared in the two groups. Clinical evaluation included manual test for muscle strength, Norris scale, bulbar scale, and forced vital capacity (FVC) percent. No significant difference was found in the progression of ALS in the two periods, although a slight slowing of the disease progression rate was found during the period of treatment, probably related to the open design of the study. Our data do not show any significant effect of reduced glutathione in modifying the progression of ALS. © Springer-Verlag 1998.

AB  - Since the production of biosynthetic human growth hormone (GH) opened up the possibility of GH replacement in GH-deficient adults, cardiac function has been investigated in a number of studies, both before and after GH therapy. In GH-deficient patients, left ventricular wall thickness and mass have been found to be decreased in comparison with normal control subjects. Furthermore, indices of systolic cardiac function such as fractional shortening, cardiac index, and of diastolic function such as E wave deceleration time have suggested impaired cardiac function in these patients. After 3-12 months of GH replacement therapy, normalization of these parameters seems to take place. In the present study, cardiac function was followed for up to 7 years in GH-treated GH-deficient adults. In a double-blind, crossover study, we performed Doppler echocardiography in 21 GH-deficient patients after 4 months of placebo and 4 months of GH therapy. Some of the patients continued with GH treatment in an open-design study. Thirteen, nine, eight and five of the patients were re-investigated following GH treatment for 16, 38, 60 and 84 months, respectively. Twenty-one age- and sex-matched normal controls were also investigated. Increased heart rate was found in placebo-treated patients compared with controls. After 4 months of GH treatment, heart rate showed a further increase (10%, p<0.01) and remained elevated after 16 months of GH therapy. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower in placebo-treated patients than in controls and did not change significantly after GH treatment. The left ventricular diastolic diameter was reduced in patients compared with controls, but increased after 4 months of GH therapy (p>0.05) and seemed to increase further during 16 months of GH therapy. Cardiac index was at the same level in controls and placebo-treated patients, but increased by 20% following GH therapy and remained elevated after 16 and 38 months (p<0.05). After 60 and 84 months of GH replacement therapy no further changes were seen and there were no signs of adverse cardiovascular effects. We conclude that long-term GH replacement in GH-deficient adults normalizes cardiovascular function without detectable adverse cardiovascular effects. ©1998, Editrice Kurtis.

AB  - Objective: To develop and implement a range of strategies to control rising drug expenditure in a teaching hospital. Method: A multidisciplinary team was established to survey drug use and to identify areas where drug wastage was occcurring. Once target areas were identified, strategies were developed and implemented and drug expenditure monitored prospectively. Results: Communication and education about optimum drug use, efficient drug handling and therapeutic drug substitution were identified as areas for action. Antibiotic prescribing, outpatient prescribing and expenditure on new drugs were identified as target areas for cost savings. Compared to previous years, the rate of increase in drug expenditure on antibiotics was reduced by over £5000, from a baseline of £552,278 over the study period compared to an increase of £65,984 for the previous corresponding period. Conclusion: We believe that despite the short-coming of the study, which adopted an open design without a control group, it demonstrates that effective cost-containment strategies can be implemented by multidisciplinary teams if they are given sufficient support by senior management.

AB  - Objective: To study the effects of the somatostatin analog octreotide on gastric mucosal function and histology during short-term (3 months) preoperative treatment in patients with acromegaly. Design: Open design clinical study. Methods: 10 patients were studied before treatment with octreotide (pre-tx), on day 1 of 300 μg octreotide/day (d300), after 1 week on 300 (w300), 600 (w600) or 1500 (w1500) μg octreotide/day, and after an additional 2.5 months on 1500 μg octreotide/day (M3). An 8 h gastrin profile was obtained and ambulatory intragastric 23h pH-metry carried out at the indicated time points. Gastroscopy was performed at pre-tx and M3 and multiple mucosal biopsy specimens taken. Results: The mean serum gastrin concentration at first declined during octreotide therapy to a nadir at w1500, then recovered despite ongoing therapy (probably in response to reduced gastric acidity) and was similar to pre-tx values at M3 (mean±S.E.: 87±26, 50±11 and 98±46 ng/l for pre-tx, w1500 and M3 respectively; P<0.05, pre-tx vs w1500). Gastric acidity had also declined at d300 (P<0.05, d300 vs pre-tx), then recovered (despite the increase in the octreotide dose), but declined again at M3 (mean pH (95% confidence interval): 2.4 (1.7-3.2), 3,3 (2.4-4.3), 2.6 (1.8-3.5, n=8) and 2.9 (1.64.2, n=7) at pre-tx, d300, w1500 and M3 respectively). The gastrin concentration at M3, although similar to pre-tx values, remained inadequately low for the reduced gastric acidity. The reduction in gastric acidity was marked during the daytime (0900-2200 h; P<0.01, d300 vs pre-tx and P=0.028, M3 vs pre-tx). However, while the stimulated postprandial gastric acid secretion was reduced at d300 (P<0.01, d300 vs pre-tx) and at M3 (n=7; P=0.027, M3 vs pre-tx), fasting and preprandial acidity was not affected. During the night, gastric acidity was reduced from 2200 to 0300 h, but the reduction was less marked than during the daytime, Paradoxically, the physiological intermittent late nocturnal reduction in acidity ('pH peaks' (0300-0800 h)) was abolished rather than enhanced. No patient acquired new Helicobacter pylori infection. The mean gastritis scores for antrum and body (n=8, Sidney classification) increased marginally from 1.7 to 1.9 (chronicity) and from 0.7 to 0.9 (atrophy), while the activity score was slightly reduced from 1.2 to 1.0. Conclusions: Three months of preoperative octreotide treatment profoundly and persistently altered gastric mucosal function (gastrin suppression, reduced acidity), but caused only minor variations in the pre-existing gastritis scores.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions for repeated nightly zolpidem dosing with flouxetine. Twenty-nine healthy female volunteers (mean age, 25.6 years) received zolpidem (10 mg) and fluoxetine (20 mg) in the following open design: zolpidem on night 1 followed by 1 washout day, a daily morning dose of fluoxetine on days 3 through 27, and a morning dose of fluoxetine plus an evening dose of zolpidem on days 28 through 32. Plasma levels of zolpidem, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine were determined at the transitions from one regimen to the next. Morning psychomotor tests were performed on days 1, 2, 28, 29, and 33. Steady-state plasma concentrations of fluoxetine/norfluoxetine were reached by day 24 of fluoxetine dosing. No significant differences in any pharmacokinetic parameters for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were observed between day 27 and day 32. There were no significant differences in AUC, maximal plasma concentration, or time to maximal concentration parameters for zolpidem plasma concentrations among nights 1, 28, and 32. There was a statistically significantly increased t 1/4 for zolpidem on night 32, compared with night 28 (3.64 and 3.29 hr, respectively). There were no significant differences in the next-morning Digit Symbol Substitution Test performance at any time in the study. Both zolpidem and fluoxetine were well tolerated alone or during coadministration. These findings indicate the absence of clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between fluoxetine and zolpidem (five consecutive doses) when the drugs are coadministered to healthy women. Therefore, based on these observations, short-term cotherapy with fluoxetine (20 mg) and zolpidem (10 mg) appears safe.

AB  - Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal disturbances with defective cellular differentiation. Vitamin D3 (VD) analogues can act on the differentiation and maturity of different cell lines. We studied the effects of VD on a series of patients with MDS in an open-design trial. Nineteen patients, 12 men and seven women, with MDS were included. Patients were 74:8 ± 5.6 years (mean ± SD), seven had refractory anaemic with ringed sideroblasts, five had refractory anaemia, one had refractory anaemia with excess of blasts and six had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. All the patients were in a low to intermediate risk group. Mean follow-up period was 26°21 months, range 9-75. Responders were defined as follows: granulocyte or platelet count increase by 50%, or haemoglobin increase of 1.5 g/dl or transfusion needs decrease by 50%. The first five patients received 266μg of calcifediol three times a week and the other 14 received calcitriol (0.25- 0.75 μg/d). Response was observed in 11 patients. In the calcifediol- treated group, one case responded, three were non-responders, and one showed progression. In the calcitriol group, 10 were responders (two with major response), and four were non-responders. No correlation was observed between baseline levels of vitamin D metabolites and the presence of response. No hypercalcaemia was observed. Treatment with vitamin D3 metabolites could induce a long-standing response of the haematological disturbance in some low-intermediate risk MDS patients without inducing hypercalcaemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of totally occluded coronary arteries is performed in a variety of clinical settings and for a variety of indications. Most commonly it is performed for relief of symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Studies have also suggested that PTCA of occluded arteries beyond the acute phase of myocardial infarction may improve left ventricular function even in the absence of objective evidence of ischemia. One of the major limitations of total occlusion PTCA is a high rate of reocclusion, reported to be as high as 40%. Recently, small studies have suggested that stenting may improve the long term outcome after PTCA of total coronary occlusions. OBJECTIVES: To determine in a prospective, randomized trial whether long term patency and clinical outcome following successful PTCA of a totally occluded coronary can be improved by the use of of a heparin-coated stent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two strategies once the guide wire had crossed the occluded segment of the target artery: PTCA alone, or PTCA followed by insertion of Palmaz-Shatz heparin coated stent(s). Randomization was stratified according to duration of the coronary occlusion: six weeks or less, and more than six weeks. The primary end-point is failure of sustained patency (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade less than 3) at six months. Secondary end-points are change in minimal luminal diameter, target vessel revascularization at one year, cardiovascular events at one year, and change in global and regional left ventricular function. BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS: All 410 patients have been randomly assigned to the PTCA alone n = 208) or PTCA plus stent (n = 202) group. Mean age was 58 ± 11 years and 18% were female. Prior myocardial infarction had been documented in 67% of patients. The duration of occlusion was six weeks or less in 40% and more than six weeks in 60% of patients. In 64% of patients TIMI flow was grade 0 and in 36% it was grade 1. STUDY IMPLICATIONS: The trial will demonstrate whether the use of a heparin-bonded stent can improve long term patency and clinical outcome in patients undergoing clinically indicated PTCA of totally occluded coronary arteries. If a significant reduction in reocclusion and clinical events is demonstrated, the Total Occlusion Study of Canada(TOSCA) would offer a more effective long term revascularization strategy in future trials testing the open artery hypothesis.

AB  - H1 antihistamines have been shown to have antitussive effects in patients with asthma and postnasal drip. In Japan, no study has been performed to determine whether orally administered oxatomide, H1 antihistamine, can reduce the chronic cough seen in patients with post- upper-airway infection (postinfection). Patients who had chronic cough of more than three weeks' duration and a history of post-upper-airway infection took part in the study. None had any history of nasal disease, gastroesophageal reflux, bronchial asthma, or other chronic pulmonary disease. All patients were non-smokers, and none used ACE inhibitors. They had normal CRP concentrations, peripheral white blood cell and eosinophil counts, serum IgE concentrations, titers of cold agglutinins and antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chest roentgenograms, and respiratory function tests. A prospective randomized, open design was used. The effect of one week of treatment with dextromethorphan (D) or with D plus oxatomide (D+O) on the severity of cough, as estimated by cough diary, were examined. Twenty-two patients entered the study, and 20 were eligible for efficacy and side- effect analyses. Nine patients receiving D and 11 receiving D+O completed the protocol. Patients' characteristics before the start of the study, such as severity and duration of cough, and laboratory data, were not significantly different between the two groups. From trial day 5 to 7, improved rates of cough were significantly higher with D+O than with D alone (p&lt;0.05). Combination therapy with oxatomide and dextromethorphan reduces subjective perception of cough as estimated by cough diary. These results suggest that oxatomide, H1 antihistamine may improve chronic cough in patients with post- upper-airway infection.

AB  - Purpose. Evaluate the efficacy of foraminal injections for the treatment of lumbar nerve root pain syndrome. Patients and Methods. Prospective open study. Patients with monoradicular nerve root pain with CT-scan-demonstrated conflict in the foramen due to discal herniation and/or facet osteophytosis. Foraminal injection with 1 ml 1%-Xylocain® and 125 mg Hydrocortancyl®. Main outcome: global pain assessment over one month (visual analogic scale). Secondary parameters: straight-leg test, EIFEL (french translation of the Rolland-Morris questionnaire) and DALLAS questionnaires. Results. 10 men and 10 women, mean age 58.2±12.6 (range 34-75). No significant decrease of the global pain. 5 patients operated on before one month due to refractory sciatic pain. Good or very good tolerance in 85%. Comments. Data suggesting no efficacy for these injections in this setting. Methodological bias include: low number of patients, open design, high percentage of patients requiring rapid surgery (indicating high severity at inclusion?), foraminal conflict including bone compression in most cases. Good tolerance should be emphasized. A larger study focusing on patients with exclusive discal foraminal conflict seems necessary.

AB  - The Internet was developed in 1965 for academic and military use. Thirty-one years later, it is regarded as the 'information superhighway' with almost one billion computer networks and well over a billion users projected to be using the Internet by the end of the century [1]. In essence, the open design of the Internet, geared towards the ease of communication and rapid development, has led to a severe lax in system security. As new developments (for example, the world wide web) and application of information technology emerge, so do the possibilities of hostile attacks on local area networks (LANS) and wide area networks (WANs). Therefore, the security aspects of the Internet and the world wide web must be carefully scrutinized. This paper outlines the security aspects of network systems and the world wide web. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In this work two basic configurations ('open' and 'semi-open') of the dehumidifier-evaporative cooler-regenerator (DER) absorption chiller have been studied and compared. They are both capable of utilizing low grade heat, since their open designs allow for operation at small differences between the heat source and the heat rejection temperatures. They employ ambient air in conjunction with an absorbent solution for producing chilled water. The machines consist of only three major components and operate at atmospheric pressure. Computer simulations of the two configurations operated under ambient conditions of a typical summer day as well as under United States Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute standard outdoor conditions have been conducted using a modified existing computer code. The semi-open configuration proved to be superior for most cases with respect to the coefficient of performance (COP). However, under typical summer day conditions, the open DER cycle performed better for chilled water temperatures above 15°C that are common in radiant cooling applications. Here, the COP attains values of about 0.8. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fatigue is a common reason for consulting a doctor but there is no definitive treatment. Hypericum perforatum has been shown to reduce symptoms of fatigue in depressed patients. It therefore may have potential value as a remedy for fatigue of unexplained origin. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effect of Hypericum on fatigue in a small group of patients in order to formulate a hypothesis upon which a randomized controlled trial could be subsequently based. The study protocol followed an uncontrolled, open design. Twenty patients consulting their doctors complaining of fatigue were treated with Hypericum extract (3×1 tablet daily) for six weeks. Compared to baseline values, perceived fatigue was significantly lower after 2 weeks of treatment and reduced significantly further after 6 weeks. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were also reduced. Baseline scores suggested that nearly half the sample may have been depressed at the start of the trial which was possibly related to fatigue. These results suggest there is scope for conducting a randomized placebo-controlled trial to investigate the specific effect of Hypericum on fatigue and that the study design must take account of the role of depression in fatigue. © Gustav Fischer Verlag 1998.

AB  - Objective: To describe alcohol disorders in the general Canadian population, using as a standard indicator the CAGE questionnaire (Have you felt you needed to cut down on your drinking? Have you felt annoyed by criticism of your drinking? Have you felt guilty about drinking? Have you felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning [eye-opener]?). Design: Secondary analysis of data from Canada's Alcohol and Other Drugs Survey (CADS), a national telephone survey conducted in 1994 of a representative sample of 12,155 people aged 15 years or more. Participants: The CAGE questionnaire was administered to 5894 drinkers who had consumed alcohol in the 12 months before the CADS survey. Main outcome measures: Respondents with positive (2 or more affirmative responses) and negative results on the CAGE questionnaire were compared as to demographic characteristics, alcohol consumption and harmful consequences of their drinking. Independent predictors of a positive result were identified by means of logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 5.8% of CAGE-tested current drinkers had a positive result on the past-year CAGE in 1994. The proportion of respondents reporting alcohol-related problems in one or more areas of their life was 7 times greater among drinkers with a positive result on the CAGE questionnaire than among those with a negative result (66.8% v. 9.5%) (p < 0.0001). When all demographic characteristics were controlled for simultaneously, male sex, residence in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec or the Prairies, single/never married or divorced/separated marital status, and low education level were found to be independent risk factors for a positive result on the CAGE questionnaire. About 85% of the respondents with a positive result had not sought help for their drinking. Applying the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the CAGE questionnaire in detecting alcohol dependence, as per criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, in a general US population, the authors estimated that 4.1% of Canadians had an alcohol dependence in 1994. Conclusion: The large proportion of current drinkers with a positive result on the CAGE questionnaire who did not seek help for their drinking underscores the need for identification and brief interventions by physicians. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying reasons for regional differences in CAGE status.

AB  - Inpatients suffering from major depression (n=62, mean age 45.7 years) were treated for 4 weeks with amitriptyline, citalopram or fluoxetine in an open design. The sample was divided into "anxious" (HAMD factor 1 score on Day O higher than 6 points) and "non-anxious" subgroups. A fenfluramine challenge, which tests the reactivity of 5-HT system in the brain, was conducted before the treatment. Blood levels of prolactin were significantly higher in the "anxious" group at hours 0, 4 and 6 during the test, which suggests a lower level of serotonin in "non-anxious" patients. The prolactin response to fenfluramine was significantly blunted in depressed patients as compared with healthy volunteers. All three study drugs significantly reduced the HAMD factor 1 score during 28 days of the treatment. No significant differences in anxiety reduction were found between amitriptyline, citalopram and fluoxetine on day 28. No significant correlation was found between the level of anxiety on day 0 and the chronicity of depression, the response to the study drug or the history of the suicidal activity.

AB  - In an increasingly complex sociotechnical world, collective practices are more and more important for accomplishing the work that needs to be done. Small-group interactions are key sites for building communities in which knowledge is a collective goal. This study investigated the nature of small group interactions among Grade 4-5 students and between these students and their teachers. From an extensive data source which includes videotaped lessons, formal and informal interviews with students and teachers, ethnographic observations, and children-produced artifacts, two case studies were constructed to illustrate general patterns representative for the interactional structures in this classroom. The study provides evidence for the interactive flexibility of students, the construction of culture, power, and norms in each interaction, and the distributed nature of students' artifacts which exceeds social construction. Traditional resources for data interpretation such as power or attention deficit disorder were not useful to predict student interactions and work.

AB  - We describe an open ring as a new design to the Zomorano-Dujovny (Z-D) stereotactic unit. The titanium base ring has an opening of 45 degrees that can be located in any chosen position. Imaging studies such as computed tomography, X-ray, positron emission tomography, digital angiography, and digital substraction angiography can be performed with the open stereotactic ring for multimodality image localization. Preoperatively and intraoperatively, this open design provides the anesthesiologist with an unobstructed pathway for airway management. During the surgical procedure, it facilitates approach to any intracranial lesion, including orbitozygomatic, combined supra-infratentorial, and others. During awake craniotomies it not only allows for easy airway management, but also provides good access to the patient's face for intraoperative evaluation of speech and visual functions. Accuracy and reliability of this unit were similar to results obtained with the original circular ring. This system can be used in conventional stereotaxis with the Z-D arc, as well as a reference for intraoperative registration with any digitizer system. The open stereotactic unit is a relatively inexpensive, reliable, and easy-to-use solution for resections using conventional stereotaxis or interactive image guidance in any intracranial site.

AB  - Magnetic resonance (MR) field strength is one of the key aspects to consider when purchasing MR equipment. Other aspects include the gradient system, coil design, computer and pulse sequence availability, purchase cost, local reimbursement policies, and current opinion within the medical community. Our objective here is to evaluate the decision-influencing aspects of the MR market, with a focus on some specific areas such as high resolution studies, examination times, special techniques, instrumentation, open design magnets, costs and reimbursement policies, academic and industrial interests, contrast media, clinical efficacy, and finally, clinicians' preferences. Certainly the advantage of high-field is a higher signal-to-noise ratio and improved resolution. With a high-field unit, higher spatial resolution images and higher temporal resolution images can be obtained. Typical imaging times needed to produce clinically diagnostic images are about 3 times longer at 0.1 T than at 1.0 or 1.5 T. High-field-related advanced techniques, such as functional imaging, spectroscopy and microscopy, may become clinically useful in the near future. As long as there is an unlimited demand for MR examinations, it appears financially profitable to run a high-field system, despite the associated higher costs. However, if demand for MR becomes saturated, low-field systems will cause less financial strain on the reimbursement organisation and service provider. Recent emphasis on cost containment, the development of interventional techniques, the increased use of MR for patients in intensive care and operating suites, the deployment of magnets in office suites, and the development of new magnet configurations, all favour the supplementary use of low-field systems. Hence, MR units of all field strengths have a role in radiology.

AB  - This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study was designed to examine the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a newly developed tramadol slow-release (SR) tablet in comparison with immediate-release tramadol capsules in patients with chronic low back pain which had persisted despite intervention with other pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological measures. 103 patients were treated with tramadol SR tablets twice daily (2 x 100 mg/day) and 102 patients with capsules 4 times daily (4 x 50 mg/day) over a period of 3 weeks. The medication in both groups (verum/placebo) was administered 4 times daily to ensure the double-blind character of the study ('double-dummy technique'). In case of insufficient pain relief the patients received 2 x 200 mg SR/day as an escape medication (open design). Daily pain intensity was assessed by patients on a 4-step verbal rating scale. At the end of the study retrograde assessment of analgesia was done by the patient using a 5-step classification. Sufficient pain relief could be achieved in approximately 60% of the patients (116 patients) who completed the 3-week treatment period. There was no difference in pain relief (SR 59% and capsules 59%) and in course of pain intensity between both groups. Furthermore, 30 patients (15.3%) were satisfactorily treated with the escape medication. Adverse events were reported at a similar rate in both groups (54.4% with the SR tablet formulation and 52.9% with the capsules). The main adverse events were nausea (l6.6%), dizziness (14.1%), vomiting (9.8%), tiredness (7.8%), diaphoresis (6.3%), headache (6.3%), constipation (6.3%) and dry mouth (6.3%). With the exception of diaphoresis, constipation and dry mouth, adverse events decreased in incidence during the study. The results confirmed the equivalence with regard to efficacy and tolerability of twice-daily administration of tramadol SR tablets compared with 4-times-daily administration of tramadol capsules.

AB  - Mortality from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is high in the elderly and in patients who have a number of underlying diseases. We evaluated the clinical efficacy of a new unusual combination, teicoplanin-ciprofloxacin, in comparison with ceftriaxone in the treatment of CAP severe enough to require hospital admission. The present multicentre (23 centres) study was an open, comparative, randomised trial using parallel groups, and was carried out according to Good Clinical Practice. All patients required admission to hospital for severe CAP, and all had a follow-up visit that included chest x-ray and a wide biochemical and, in some cases, microbiological profile. 240 patients were enrolled: 158 elderly (over 65 years), 82 with underlying disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary primary or metastatic cancer, congestive heart failure, ketoacidotic diabetes), and 71 previously pretreated with other antibiotics with no cure or improvement. 121 patients (mean age 68.4 ± 15.5 years) were randomised to treatment with single-dose teicoplanin 400mg intravenously on the first day followed by 200 (37 patients) or 400 mg/day (84 patients) according to the severity of the disease, plus ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily orally (TEICO group). 119 patients (mean age 68.9 ± 12.1 years) were randomised to single-dose ceftriaxone 2 g/day intravenously (CEF group). The two groups were homogeneous with regard to gender, pretreatment with other antibiotics, underlying diseases or illness severity at enrolment. Treatment was given for 10.2 ± 3.1 days in the TEICO group and for 9.6 ± 3.3 days in the CEF group. Cure or improvement was observed in 85.1% of patients in the TEICO group vs 73.1% in the CEF group, while failures occurred in 5.8% (7 of 121) in the TEICO group, and 23.5% (28 of 119) in the CEF group (the remaining patients were not evaluable for various reasons). Thus, the combination teicoplanin-ciprofloxacin was associated with a failure risk four times lower than ceftriaxone therapy (p < 0.001). Tolerability was good for both treatment regimens. In conclusion, in spite of the limitations of our study (open design, no microbiological diagnosis) the teicoplanin-ciprofloxacin combination appears to represent a good approach to the empirical treatment of CAP in the elderly and in patients with underlying diseases.

AB  - Despite the increasing use of dry powder formulations in the ambulatory setting, there is a paucity of information on the efficacy of this therapeutic modality to treat acute severe asthma. In addition, studies that compared wet nebulization vs metered dose inhalers formulated with chlorofluorocarbon (CFCMDI) attached to holding chambers have yielded discrepant results. Thus, it is unclear which of the three delivery systems would elicit a superior bronchodilator response, particularly in patients with life-threatening asthma. In a prospective, randomized open design, we studied the response to inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) in 27 adult asthmatics presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an FEV1 &lt;30% predicted. Subjects were treated with one of the following regimens (nine subjects in each group): group A, mean (SD) baseline FEV1 of 0.7 (0.2) L, received albuterol solution, 5 mg, via a nebulizer (Puritan-Bennett Raindrop; Lawrenceville, Ga) impelled with oxygen (O2) at 8 L/min; group B, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.15) L, received albuterol, 400 μg, via a CFCMDI attached to a 145-mL valved aerosol holding chamber (Aerochamber; Trudell Medical; London, ON); and group C, baseline FEV1 of 0.6 (0.17) L, received albuterol powder, 400 μg, by another means (Rotahaler; Glaxo; Research Triangle Park, NC). All groups received the respective treatments on arrival in the ED, every 30 min during the first 2 h, and then hourly until the sixth hour. Clinical parameters and FEV1 were recorded on ED admission and 15 min after each dose of albuterol. At the time of ED admission, all patients also received continuous O2 and one dose of IV steroids (dexamethasone, 8 mg). The total dose of inhaled albuterol administered during the 6-h treatment was 45 mg of nebulized solution in group A and 3,600 μg of albuterol aerosol and dry powder in groups B and C, respectively. No significant differences were found in the population demographics, baseline FEV1, and arterial blood gas values on air. FEV1 improved significantly in all patients after the 6 h of treatment. The 6-h area under the curve FEV1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered. No patient was discontinued during the trial or admitted to hospital and no evidence of cardiovascular adverse events was apparent in any of the study groups. These data support the view that the three delivery methods appear adequate to treat subjects with acute severe asthma.

AB  - Direct seeding practices that promote soil and water conservation and reduce input costs have become an increasingly accepted alternative to conventional tillage systems in western Canada. The objective of the present study was to determine the relative importance of soil characteristics, seeding depth, operating speed, and opener design on draft forces during direct seeding in central Saskatchewan. Draft was measured for nine different openers operated at 1-5 cm seeding depths and three ground speeds in four untilled Chernozemic soils that differed in soil moisture and/or texture. The average increase in opener draft for all fields was 4% for each km h-1 increase in speed. Although the range in soil consistency was small, there was a 24% increase in draft in heavy clay compared to sandy loam soil. Draft force of the average opener increased by nearly 20% for each centimeter increase in seeding depth. However, highly significant interactions among most of the variables investigated indicated that the relative performance of openers was not consistent for the range of conditions evaluated. Large differences among the draft forces of different openers operated at different depths in soils with different consistencies were particularly noteworthy. For example, a 4.5-fold increase in the draft of a low versus a high draft opener operated at 1.25 versus 5.0 cm seeding depth at 7.5 km h-1 in moist, heavy clay soil emphasized the large influence that opener design and seeding depth have on tractor power requirements and direct seeding input costs.

AB  - Treatment outcome in congenital adrenal hyperplasia is often suboptimal due to hyperandrogenism, treatment-induced hypercortisolism, or both. As a new approach, we hypothesized that the effects of androgen could be blocked by an antiandrogen (flutamide) and an inhibitor of androgen to estrogen conversion (testolactone), thus allowing the hydrocortisone dose to be reduced. We conducted a short term pilot study in 12 children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a randomized cross-over open design to determine whether flutamide, testolactone, reduced hydrocortisone dose, and fludrocortisone are more effective than hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment in normalizing linear growth, weight gain, and bone maturation. Each regimen was administered for 6 months, with a 3-month washout period, consisting of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment, between regimens. Compared to hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment, the regimen of flutamide, testolactone, reduced hydrocortisone dose (from 12.9 to 7.9 mg/m2 · day), and fludocortisone produced an increase in plasma 17- hydroxyprogesterone levels (P &lt; 0.05) and a decline in urinary cortisol (P &lt; 0.01), linear growth rate (-0.9 ± 0.5 vs. 1.4 ± 0.6 SD U; P = 0.003), weight velocity (-0.80 ± 0.4 vs. 0.6 ± 0.4 SD U; P = 0.01), and bone maturation (0.6 ± 0.6 vs. 1.4 ± 0.9 yr bone age/yr chronological age; P = 0.02). Although no important adverse effects were observed, the known potential for flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity made frequent monitoring essential. We conclude that the regimen of flutamide, testolactone, reduced hydrocortisone dose, and fludrocortisone improves the short term control of growth and bone maturation in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Long term studies are required to determine whether this approach can improve these children's growth and development.

AB  - Objectives. Despite significant advances in automatic garage door opener design, automatic garage door openers continue to severely injure or kill children. In this investigation, we sought to determine the frequency and circumstances of accidents that have caused severe injury or death to children. We also tried to develop a means by which homeowners can evaluate their door openers. Methods. We present the histories of three children severely injured or killed by automatic garage door openers. We reviewed national data of similar accidents primarily published by the US Product Safety Commission and Underwriters Laboratories. Also, we evaluated 50 automatic door openers for safety of operation. The reversing mechanisms of door openers were tested using a cardiopulmonary resuscitation mannequin, a roll of paper towels, and a block of wood. Results. In the United States, at least 85 children have had permanent brain injury or have died since 1974 as a result of accidents involving automatic door openers. A review of circumstances of the accidents illustrates that accidents are caused both by use of the openers by children and by faults in design. Most accidents have occurred when children have found access to the activation devices and have been entrapped under closing doors that failed to reverse. However, in one case, an adult activated the opener and left the premises before the door completely closed. Our evaluation of 50 garage door openers showed that although 88% percent reversed when encountering a block of wood, 40% failed to reverse when coming down on a supine, child-sized cardiopulmonary resuscitation mannequin. Conclusions. Automatic garage door openers pose a serious risk of severe injury or death to children. It is probable that many doors would not reverse if they came down on a young child. Therefore, we have devised a way for homeowners to test their door openers that closely mimics our evaluations using the mannequin by using a large roll of paper towels. If the door fails to reverse using this test, we suggest that homeowners disconnect their openers and operate the doors manually until the openers are serviced or replace their automatic openers with one that meets the latest Underwriters Laboratory standards. We also have other recommendations regarding the safe operation of the doors, including improving the safety standards for openers in apartment complexes. Compliance with these recommendations should reduce the number of injuries to children caused by garage door openers. Copyright © 1996 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Background: Risperidone, a 5-HT2 and D2 antagonist, has been shown to be an effective an tipsychotic in the treatment of schizophrenia but has unclear efficacy in the treatment of psychotic affective disorders. The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of acute mania with psychotic features. Method: We conducted an open-label pilot study of risperidone and concurrent mood-stabilizing drugs in the treatment of acute mania with psychotic features. Patients were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Efficacy was measured weekly with the use of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: Ten women and 5 men (mean age = 38 years) were included in the study. Of the 13 patients who completed 2 weeks of treatment. 8 of these 13 had a 50% improvement of the BPRS, and all 13 had at least a 25% improvement (p = .002, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 46.0 to 57.8). Of the 8 patients who completed 6 weeks of treatment, 7 of the 8 had a 50% improvement, and all 8 had a 25% improvement (p= .012, 95% CI = 52.4 to 69.3). Similar results were obtained with the YMRS. By the second week of treatment, 10 of the 13 patients remaining in treatment had at least a 50% improvement, and 12 of these 13 had a 25% improvement (p = .002, 95% CI = 55.1 to 89.9). By the sixth week, all of the 8 patients remaining in treatment had a 75% improvement (p = .012, 95% CI = 90.5 to 102.8). The medication was well tolerated, and no case worsened. Conclusion: When used with concomitant mood stabilizing drugs, risperidone may be effective and well tolerated in patients with acute mania with psychotic features. Considering the open design, small sample size, and limited period of observation, further studies need to be conducted.

AB  - Since early treatment of depression with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) can be associated with insomnia, daytime antidepressive therapy with SSRI is often combined with nighttime administration of a hypnotic. This study attempted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between zolpidem 10 mg, a short-acting hypnotic, and fluoxetine 20 mg, an SSRI. Twenty-seven healthy male volunteers (mean age 23.5 years, range 20-29) received zolpidem and fluoxetine in the following open design: zolpidem on night 1, a morning dose of fluoxetine daily from day 2 through day 18 and zolpidem on night 18. Using HPLC, plasma levels of zolpidem, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine were determined throughout night I for zolpidem, night 18 for zolpidem, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine on days 16 and 17 for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. Morning psychomotor tests were performed on days 1, 2, 18, and 19. Statistical analysis of data consisted of repeated measures of ANOVA. There was no significant difference in AUC, C(max), and T( 1/2 ) of zolpidem plasma concentrations between night 1 (zolpidem) and night 18 (zolpidem and fluoxetine). There was a significantly higher zolpidem plasma level at 0.5 hours after dosing together with a significantly shorter T(max) on night 18 compared to night 1. There was no significant difference in C(min) of plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels between day 16 and 17 of fluoxetine dosing, and there was no difference in T(max) between day 17 (fluoxetine) and day 18 (fluoxetine and zolpidem). There was a 3-4% increase in AUC and C(max) of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations in the presence of zolpidem. There was no difference in the next morning performance tests after nighttime treatment of zolpidem alone after 17 consecutive days of fluoxetine treatment, or after zolpidem in the presence of steady-state plasma concentrations of fluoxetine. Both zolpidem and fluoxetine were well tolerated alone or in combination. It is concluded that the onset of action of zolpidem may possibly be shortened in the presence of fluoxetine, but no other significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions occurred between zolpidem and fluoxetine.

AB  - We report a rf coil design based on the Alderman-Grant coil called the modified Alderman-Grant coil (MAGC), and demonstrate its efficacy in the magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM). The rf field of the MAGC has a magnitude comparable to that of a solenoidal coil of similar size (for the same input power) but the coil has a much smaller inductance. This is advantageous in electron spin resonance MRFM experiments which would benefit from rf frequencies in excess of 1000 MHz. The open design of the MAGC is also advantageous because it provides superior access to the sample mounted on a mechanical cantilever by the optical fiber and permanent magnet and so allows he sample to be placed at the center of the coil. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Real world engineering design projects require the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams using sophisticated and powerful engineering tools. The individuals or the individual groups of the multidisciplinary design teams work in parallel and independently often for quite a long time with different tools located on various sites. In order to ensure the coordination of design activities in the different groups or the cooperation among the different tools, it is necessary to develop an efficient design environment. This paper discusses a distributed architecture for integrating such engineering tools in an open design environment, organized as a population of asynchronous cognitive agents. Before introducing the general architecture and the communication protocol, issues about an agent architecture and inter-agent communications are discussed. A prototype of such an environment with seven independent agents located in several workstations and microcomputers is then presented and demonstrated on an example of a small mechanical design. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - We have built and tested a system that is capable of simultaneous molecular beam deposition and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging at T=300-1000 K. The STM is based on the beetle-type design. Active compensation of thermal drift reduces the residual drift in the images to ∼2 Å/min at 850 K sample temperature. Measurements at varying sample temperatures are also feasible. Due to the open design of the STM, a molecular beam from a commercial microevaporator is aimed between tip and sample. With our system, simultaneous molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and STM experiments during growth at high temperature are feasible. This method (MBSTM) provides the possibility to follow the MBE growth process with the STM in a real in situ way. The operation characteristics and performance of this instrument will be shown using examples of silicon homoepitaxy and Ge/Si heteroepitaxy. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disabling disorder associated with neuroleptic-treatment. Despite the existence of many different therapeutic strategies, TD is often refractory to any treatment. The atypical neuroleptic Clozapine, associated with a relatively low rate of parkinsonism and TD, may have a particular role in the management of neuroleptic-induced TD. The present study will critically analyze the results of the different studies relating to Clozapine's efficacy in TD and its mechanisms. Focus will be on trials wherein the main indication for clozapine's use was the management of TD. Ten of the fourteen relevant studies evaluated, primarily of open design, demonstrated considerable reduction with Clozapine in TD symptomatology in significant proportion of the patients. The dosage required was high, the treatment period long, and cessation of medication was associated with a significant rebound-effect. Clozapine may be efficient in the management of TD. Placebo-controlled designs, employing different dose regiments are required to further establish the role of Clozapine in this disabling disorder.

AB  - Pharmacists must ensure that patients know how to make the best use of their medication. An education programme was initiated in the southernmost part of Sweden during 1990 in order to improve the communication skills of pharmacy staff and the information given to customers. Customers with prescriptions for Turbuhaler® were asked to 'show-and-tell' how they used their inhalers, and the results were documented. In April 1992, 53% of patients handled their Turbuhaler® correctly. One year later a significantly higher proportion of the patients (67%) used their inhalers correctly. If patients are asked to 'show-and-tell' how they use their medication and how they interpret the information given, then errors in their handling of the medicines can be revealed. If advice on the proper use of drugs is given to individual patients, then mishandling is reduced. The study used an open design, so the conclusions drawn can only be tentative. However, the magnitude of the change observed suggests that the conclusions are valid.

AB  - Background: The acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina and non-Q- wave infarction are initiated by coronary plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation. Thrombin is central to this response as it activates platelets and the coagulation system. In an open design study we assessed the tolerability and safety of the low molecular weight thrombin inhibitor, inogatran, for unstable angina or non-Q-wave infarction. Methods: Thirty- seven patients, treated within 72 h of symptoms, were allocated consecutively to groups to receive a 4 h infusion with one of three doses of inogatran. Thrombin generation and activity were measured with plasma markers at baseline, after the 4 h treatment period and 4 h later. Ischaemia was monitored using continuous vectorcardiography during the 4 h of treatment and during the subsequent 4 h after inogatran infusion had been stopped, to detect any increase in ischaemic events after the period of treatment. In addition, 12 patients received inogatran as an infusion for 72 h. Results: Inogatran was tolerated well. There were no adverse haemodynamic effects or allergic reactions. Minor bleeding events were detected in 37% of the patients. The biochemical and vectorcardiographic findings indicated suppression of thrombin generation after the 4 h treatment period compared with baseline. During the first 4 h after inogatran treatment, thrombin activity and episodes of ischaemia were increased compared with during the treatment period. Conclusion: Inogatran was tolerated well and was safe, but its discontinuation was followed by a reactivation of thrombin activity and ischaemia. Whether this reactivation represented a rebound phenomenon, or merely resulted from the discontinuation of an effective therapy, cannot be established from the present study.

AB  - A dose-ranging study of the use of oral naloxone in opioid-related constipation in patients with far-advanced cancer is reported. Naloxone doses were calculated as a percentage of the morphine dose each patient was receiving. Seventeen patients entered the first phase of the study, which had a randomised, double-blind design. Outcome measures were small bowel transit time (SBTT) measured by the lactulose/hydrogen breath test, pain scores and the occurrence of adverse events. One subject was excluded before receiving naloxone. No significant difference between placebo and naloxone occurred in the 14 remaining patients receiving total daily doses of naloxone 10% or less of the 24 h dose of morphine. Two further patients experienced a marked laxative effect with naloxone at 20% of the 24 h dose of morphine. In one of these, SBTT was available and was unchanged from placebo. The other declined to continue with SBTT measurement. Phase two of the study had an open design, in which laxative effects were determined clinically. Naloxone at a maximum dose level of 20% was given to seven patients, up to 40% to two patients and up to 80% to one patient. Four out of the seven patients in the 20% dose level group, and all of the remainder, experienced laxative effects. Two patients experienced symptoms of opioid withdrawal, one of whom also had return of pain. It is concluded that oral naloxone at a daily dose of 20% or more of the prevailing 24 h morphine dose is a potentially valuable therapy for opioid-related constipation. However, opioid withdrawal was observed and it is suggested that initial individual naloxone doses should not exceed 5 mg. Further research is needed into the oral absorption of naloxone, as well as further studies of clinical efficacy and dosing.

AB  - Botulinum toxin (BoTox) is a potent inhibitor of the release of acetylcholine from terminal nerves and has been used successfully in spastic disorders of skeletal muscle. Its used for the treatment of disorders of gastrointestinal smooth muscle has recently been explored. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of transendoscopic injection of BoTox in 13 symptomatic patients with achalasia G II (Siewert classification) without previous treatment of an ongoing randomized-controlled trial. Patients were blindly randomized to administrate: a) 8OU of BoTox were injected in four quadrants (1 ml in each quadrant-20 U/ml) (n = 8), b) normal saline solution as placebo injected in the same way (n = 5). Patients who did not respond were retreated in an open design with the same schedule of BoTox. BoTox or placebo were injected directly into the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), located by manometric and endoscopic procedures, via sclerotherapy injector. Response to treatment was assessed by changes in symptoms score, weight, LES pressure, barium esophagograms and endoscopy. All determinations were repeated at basal and after 7-30-60 and 90 days of treatment. Post treatment response was considered positive if at one month, 3 of 4 parameters were improved. No evidence of response to BoTox were assessed in 3 patients. At 90 days, 10 patients remain well and data are as follows: (mean +/- SD) symptoms score: (Pre: 3.23 +/- 0.44) (Post: 1.31 +/- 0.95); LES pressure (mmHg) (Pre: 53, 15 +/- 66.31 +/- 7.49); % reduction of esophageal diameter 55% (p < 0.0001) (pair T-test). Relaxation of LES did not change after treatment. There were no side effects related to BoTox injection. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic intrasphincteric BoTox injection is safe, simple and effective in the short term treatment for achalasia. Further studies are necessary for evaluation of long term effects.

AB  - Objective. To assess the clinical efficacy and equivalence of a daily vs alternate day regimen, and the potency ratio between 2 glucocorticoids, deflazacort and 6-methylprednisolone. Methods. Thirty-one patients with recent onset polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) were randomly assigned to deflazacort (n = 16) or 6-methylprednisolone (n = 15), according to a 2 period (duration of each period = 6 weeks), crossover, open design for comparing 2 dose regimens (daily vs alternate day), and according to a between-patients, double blind design for comparing the therapeutic effects of the 2 glucocorticoids (deflazacort vs 6-methylprednisolone). The patients, either during alternate day or daily regimen, were treated with fixed oral doses for the first 2 weeks (assuming a potency ratio deflazacort/6-methylprednisolone of 1.5 mg/1.0 mg: deflazacort 24 mg or 6-methylprednisolone 16 mg, daily; deflazacort 48 mg or 6-methylprednisolone 32 mg, alternate day), and with titrated doses for the next 10 weeks. Results. Two patients dropped out during the first 6 week period. The time course and extent of the improvement of disease activity indices (limb-girdle pain, morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and plasma fibrinogen) were not statistically different under the 2 regimens. The satisfactory equivalent glucocorticoid response observed in 12 pairs of patients:treated with deflazacort and 6-methylprednisolone progressed significantly from baseline to the end of the study, under daily or alternate day regimen, with no significant difference between the 2 glucocorticoids. Deflazacort proved less potent than 6-methylprednisolone (1.78 mg: 1.0 mg minimum effective daily dose; 1.68: 1.0, alternate day), but equally effective. Conclusion. The 2 dose regimens, 6-methylprednisolone and deflazacort showed no significant differences in terms of efficacy during the short term treatment of PMR. Deflazacort proved less potent than initially estimated.

AB  - A multi-centre study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of fluoxetine in two groups of major depression: 'agitated-anxious' and 'blunted-retarded'. The study included 50 patients presenting a major depressive episode (following DSM III-R criteria and score ≥ 20 on MADRS): 26 in 'agitated-anxious' group (score ≥ 15 on Hamilton anxiety scale and ≥ 10 on Tyrer anxiety brief scale) and 24 in the 'blunted-retarded' group (score ≥ 15 on Widlocher retardation scale and ≥ 10 on Abrams-Taylor blunted affect scale). After one week period on placebo, all patients were treated in an open design with fluoxetine at a fixed daily dose of 20 mg and followed on a period of 6 weeks with active treatment. In spite of a significant antidepressant efficacy of fluoxetine in the two groups, better results were observed in the 'agited-anxious' depressed group: marked improvement on MADRS total score at day 42 (76% decrease vs 62% in the 'blunted-retarded' group, p = 0,012), greater number of 'responders' defined by a decrease ≥ 50% on MADRS total score and a total score ≤ 12 (95% vs 58%, p = 0,04), better patient's global impression on efficacy (54% of 'excellent efficacy' vs 18%, p = 0,012),more improvement on HSCL-63 total score (mean decrease of 69% vs 39%, p = 0,016), higher improvement on 'hostility/interpersonal hypersensitivity' score (mean decrease of 74% vs 37%, p = 0,001) and on 'anger attacks/irritability' sub-score (mean decrease of 73% vs 30%, p = 0,0002). The tolerance evaluation showed that side effects were reported equally in the two groups (respectively 31% vs 33%). 80% of the 'agited-anxious' group reported good global tolerance vs 52% in the other group (p = 0,07). Our results are consistent with other publications showing that fluoxetine produces a clinically significant anxiolytic, anti-hostility and anti-impulsivity effects in major depression. Finally, our results supported a dimensional dichotomy separating between 'agitated-anxious' and 'blunted-retarded' forms of major depression.

AB  - Objectives: To study the ability of different ventilatory approaches to keep the lung open. Design: Different ventilatory patterns were applied in surfactant deficient lungs with PEEP set to achieve pre-lavage PaO2. Setting: Experimental laboratory of a University Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care. Animals: 15 anaesthetised piglets. Interventions: One volume-controlled mode (L-IPPV201:1.5) and two pressure-controlled modes at 20 breaths per minute (bpm) and I:E ratios of 2:1 and 1.5:1 (L-PRVC202:1 and L-PRVC201.5:1), and two pressure-controlled modes at 60 bpm and I:E of 1:1 and 1:1.5 (L-PRVC601:1 and L-PRVC601:1.5) were investigated. The pressure-controlled modes were applied using "Pressure-Regulated Volume-Controlled Ventilation" (PRVC). Measurements and results: Gas exchange, airway pressures, hemodynamics, FRC and intrathoracic fluid volumes were measured. Gas exchange was the same for all modes. FRC was 30% higher with all post-lavage settings. By reducing inspiratory time MPAW decreased from 25 cmH2O by 3 cmH2O with L-PRVC201.5:1 and L-PRVC601:1.5. End-inspiratory airway pressure was 29 cmH2O with L-PRVC201.5:1 and 40 cmH2O with L-IPPV201:1.5, while the other modes displayed intermediate values. End-inspiratory lung volume was 65 ml/kg with L-IPPV201:1.5, but it was reduced to 50 and 49 ml/kg with L-PRVC601:1 and L-PRVC601:1.5. Compliance was 16 and 18 ml/cmH2O with L-PRVC202:1 and L-PRVC201.5:1, while it was lower with L-IPPV201:1.5, L-PRVC601:1 and L-PRVC601:1.5. Oxygen delivery was maintained at prelavage level with L-PRVC201.5:1 (657 ml/min·m2), the other modes displayed reduced oxygen delivery compared with pre-lavage. Conclusion: Neither the rapid frequency modes nor the low frequency volume-controlled mode kept the surfactant deficient lungs open. Pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation (20 bpm) kept the lungs open at reduced end-inspiratory airway pressure and hence reduced risk of barotrauma. Reducing I:E ratio in this latter modality from 2:1 to 1.5:1 further improved oxygen delivery. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In an open design, the opiate antagonist, naltrexone (25 mg bid), was added for six weeks to the neuroleptic regimen of seven inpatient polydipsic hyponatremic schizophrenics. Mannerisms and diurnal weight change improved slightly, the latter probably not as a consequence of diminished intake alone. Further studies are needed to clarify if stereotypies and polydipsia are modulated by endogenous opiates, and if opiate antagonists are of therapeutic value in this population. © 1995.

AB  - The use of combinations of second line antirheumatic agents (SLAs) is increasing. There are several reasons for combination therapy, e.g. the unsatisfactory effects of single therapy. Strategies for combining SLAs are to begin with combinations, or to add one or more agents to another. The strategy of adding one agent to another is illustrated by a study of 40 patients having insufficient effect from sulphasalazine (SASP). Patients were randomized between methotrexate (MTX) and the combination of SASP and MTX. The patients were evaluated by a single observer in an open design. The follow-up was 24 weeks. The mean decrease in disease activity score was significantly greater and occurred earlier in the combination group. This favourable response was also present in the other efficacy variables. The incidence of toxicity was equal in both groups. These results support the strategy of adding MTX to SASP when combining these second line antirheumatic drugs. © 1995 British Society for Rheumatology.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of a conditioned care environment per se on bacterial colonization of burn wounds. Two cohorts of burn patients were treated in the successive years 1992 and 1993, the first group in a (permanent) purpose-designed unit and the second in wards of traditional 'open' design, during renovation of the unit. Patients who were admitted to the permanent and temporary units numbered 224 and 231 respectively, the groups being similar in features that generally influence the course and outcome of burn injuries. The principles and practice of treatment by the burn care team remained the same in both years. No significant difference in wound colonization rates was found between the two groups. We conclude that while the other known advantages of managing burn patients in purpose-designed units remain valid, a conditioned care environment per se does not influence bacterial colonization rates of burn wounds. © 1995.

AB  - A new therapeutic approach to the treatment of osteoarthritis is presented in this paper. We carried out a long term (30 months), open design study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of repeated courses of treatment with hyaluronic acid (HA) in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. A total of 75 patients (35 males, 40 females) were included in the study. Treatment was one weekly, intraarticular administration of 20 mg/2 ml HA (Hyalart(®) Fidia S.p.A., Abano Terme, Italy) for 5 consecutive weeks and this therapeutic schedule was repeated every 6 months over a period of 25 months. Hence, each patient received a total of 25 intra-articular injections. All 75 patients completed the study. Spontaneous pain decreased after the first treatment course and continued to decrease up to the end of the study when it showed an improvement of 55% compared with baseline values. The other pain parameters assessed also showed substantial decreases throughout the study. Joint flexion and extension showed a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) at the end of the study compared with baseline values. A substantial improvement was also observed for morning stiffness and supra-patellar circumference. The overall efficacy was judged as 'very good' in 36 cases (48%), 'good' in 30 cases (40%) and 'poor' in 9 cases (12%). Neither local nor systemic adverse events were observed. Given the interesting results obtained, it would be appropriate to carry out controlled studies to confirm these promising findings.

AB  - The halo cervical orthosis has proven extremely effective in stabilizing the spine, both non-operatively and as a supplement to operative procedures. Current designs of the available halo utilize either a closed or an open stabilizing ring. Twenty-four patients with various indications for halo application are reviewed. Eleven were treated with a closed ring apparatus (Ace Medical, Los Angeles, California), and thirteen with an open ring device (Bremer, Inc, Jacksonville, Florida). X-rays of the treated patients were compared by group, and patients were interviewed regarding their complaints while wearing the halo.Rates of complication were compared. Results showed no significant differences between radiographs (kyphosis or translation) throughout the follow-up period. Patients experienced a significantly higher incidence of halo-associated pain in the open group. Otherwise, there were no statistical differences in the complication rates of either device. Whether or not the higher incidence of pain in the open group is related to decreased device rigidity is unknown. The open design may theoretically permit bending and opening of the ring to occur, the so-called ‘wishbone’ effect. Based on these data, it cannot be determined whether the advantages of the open ring-ease of application-are offset by this potential disadvantage. Clearly, a larger, randomized prospective study is required to investigate this. © 1995, International Spinal Cord Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Twenty-four-hour serum cortisol secretion is a sensitive parameter for the assessment of the pituitary-adrenal function of asthmatic children treated with inhaled corticosteroids. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of the long-term administration of inhaled budesonide on 24-hour cortisol production in young children with asthma. Methods: We studied 11 children, aged 7 to 12 years, with severe perennial asthma. All had been receiving 100 μg of inhaled budesonide twice daily, administered with a spacer device, for 3 to 5 years. Serum cortisol concentration was measured at 8:00 AM, 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of corticotropin, and every 30 minutes for 24 hours in an open-design study. Urinary cortisol secretion was measured by 24-hour urine collection. All determinations were made with a radioimmunoassay kit. Results: The individual morning serum cortisol concentration and the serum cortisol concentration at 60 minutes after corticotropin stimulation were within normal limits in all children. The 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was also normal. The individual 24-hour serum cortisol concentration showed a normal pattern in all children, with no evidence of nocturnal suppression of serum cortisol concentration. Conclusion: Prolonged (3 to 5 years) administration of 200 μg/day of inhaled budesonide in young children with severe asthma does not impair pituitary-adrenal function, even according to the sensitive test for 24-hour serum cortisol secretion.

AB  - Twelve patients with refractory chronic congestive heart failure (Class IV NYHA), related to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (10 patients); previous myocardial infarction (one patient) and peripartum cardiomyopathy (one patient), received Terminalia Arjuna, an Indian medicinal plant, as bark extract (500 mg 8-hourly) or matching placebo for 2 weeks each, separated by 2 weeks washout period, in a double blind cross over design as an adjuvent to maximally tolerable conventional therapy (Phase I). The clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation was carried out at baseline and at the end of Terminalia Arjuna and placebo therapy and results were compared. Terminalia Arjuna, compared to placebo, was associated with improvement in symptoms and signs of heart failure, improvement in NYHA Class (Class III vs. Class IV), decrease in echo-left ventricular enddiastolic (125.28 ± 27.91 vs. 134.56 ± 29.71 ml/m2; P &lt; 0.005) and endsystolic volume (81.06 ± 24.60 vs. 94.10 ± 26.42 ml/m2; P &lt; 0.005) indices, increase in left ventricular stroke volume index (44.21 ± 11.92 vs. 40.45 ± 11.56 ml/m2; P &lt; 0.05) and increase in left ventricular ejection fractions (35.33 ± 7.85 vs. 30.24 ± 7.13%; P &lt; 0.005). On long term evaluation in an open design (Phase II), wherein Phase I participants continued Terminalia Arjuna in fixed dosage (500 mg 8-hourly) in addition to flexible diuretic, vasodilator and digitalis dosage for 20-28 months (mean 24 months) on outpatient basis, patients showed continued improvement in symptoms, signs, effort tolerance and NYHA Class, with improvement in quality of life. One patient died of cerebrovascular accident while another had sudden cardiac death, 16 months and 14 months after entry into Phase II, respectively. No significant clinical untoward effect occurred during Terminalia Arjuna or placebo therapy. The mechanism of beneficial effects of Terminalia Arjuna needs evaluation but it could be related to one or more of the constituents which have cardiotonic (glycosides) or free radicle scavenger (tannins, flavones) properties. In conclusion, adjuvent Terminalia Arjuna therapy in our patients with refractory congestive heart failure, mostly related to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, appeared safe and caused long lasting improvement in symptoms and signs of heart failure along with improvement in left ventricular ejection phase indices with definite improvement in quality of life. We believe that these preliminary observations open a new vista for future research in therapy of myocardial failure. © 1995.

AB  - In the present study, the antidepressant efficacy of a controlled-release (CR) formulation of trazodone was evaluated in 18 depressed patients treated with 150 mg (no. = 10) or 75 mg (no. = 8) nocte doses of the drug for 7 weeks, according to an open design. Drug plasma levels were evaluated on days 7, 14, 28 and 35 of treatment. Moreover, at the end of treatment, the plasma concentration-time curve of the CR trazodone was assessed. CR trazodone was effective in improving depressive and anxious symptomatology as well as in ameliorating the quality of sleep in 13 patients with a low incidence of side effects. Nonresponder subjects had morning plasma levels of trazodone below the value of 650 ng/ml. The pharmacokinetic profile of CR trazodone, oberved after 35 days of treatment, may account for both the low occurrence of untoward side effects and the therapeutic efficacy of the single dose at nighttime.

AB  - The programmable controller (PLC) has progressed from a simple, solid-state substitution for electromechanical relays to a special function microcomputer with numerous process control capacities. In spite of threats from PCs and other alternative control platforms, the markets for PLCs grew with novel technologies applications and uses. The future migration towards open hardware and software platforms promises to render PLCs more commonplace on the factory floor. In the automated future, PLCs will continue to proffer a versatile spectrum of functionality, from simple on/off control to advanced automation solutions.

AB  - Variations of serum and nasal specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) during alternate periods of antigen avoidance-exposure have been evaluated with an open design in a group of allergic children with asthma and rhinitis at the residential house Istituto Pio XII (Misurina, BL, Italy), at 1756 m, in the Italian Dolomites. A method based on direct incubation of allergen coupled substrate on the nasal mucosa has been employed to evaluate the levels of nasal IgE. Serum specific IgE decreased respectively from (median) 117-89.3 kU/l (P < 0.001) during an initial period of 3 months of allergen avoidance and from 88.2 to 78.4 kU/l (P < 0.0002) during a subsequent period of allergen avoidance. No significant increase in serum specific IgE was, in contrast, observed during two periods, 22 and 9 days, of antigen exposure, changing respectively from 89.3 to 88.2 and from 78.4 to 89.1 kU/l. In contrast, nasal IgE has been significantly influenced by the alternate periods of antigen exposure-avoidance, showing a decrease from 19.75 to 4.01 kU/l (P < 0.0001) after the initial period of avoidance, followed by an increase to 9.95 kU/l (P < 0.0001) after 22 days of exposure. A significant decrease to a value of 2.37 kU/l (P < 0.0001) was also observed during the subsequent period of avoidance, followed again by an increase to 7.87 kU/l (P < 0.002) after 9 days of exposure. The evaluation of the kinetics of changes in nasal specific IgE revealed a significant decrease (P < 0.01) as soon as antigen avoidance was implemented for 3 days. Nasal specific IgE, therefore, appears to be a more sensitive index of antigen exposure-avoidance than serum IgE levels.

AB  - Considerable development has taken place of the CO2 sputter source at Oxford. The use of a hemispherical ioniser has increased reproducibility of beam behaviour and a more open source design has helped to improve the initial cleaning of the targets. The operation of the source with graphite has also been investigated with 12C- currents in excess of 300 μA achieved. Space charge effects in the injection system have been reduced by neutralisation which can be achieved using a gas dosing valve in the region of the first beam waist. Preliminary experiments have been done to test the feasibility of linking the source to a GC system for GC-AMS. © 1994.

AB  - More people will be able to gain access to the benefits of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the development of a low-field MR scanner. The novel scanner, named Magnetom Open, employs an electromagnet to generate the machine's 0.2 tesla magnetic field. The open design allows the doctors freedom needed to access joints in motion. It also presents the potential for MRI-guided interventional methods. Because of the open geometry, it is now viable to perform therapy and diagnosis simultaneously by means of MR-compatible medical devices. Proposed applications include biopsis and ablative treatments.

AB  - This year, Apple and IBM will introduce the first powerPC systems. Preliminary benchmarks show that these systems will offer better-than-Pentium performance, in some cases at lower-than-Pentium prices. They discard the 10-year-old IBM AT architecture in favor of more flexible, open designs. And most importantly, they replace the venerable intel 80 × 86 CPU with the RISC-based PowerPC.

AB  - The effect of the selective serotonin-2 antagonist ritanserin was investigated in an open study of patients with schizophrenia. The patients were in an acute psychotic state considered to require neuroleptic medication. No neuroleptic drug was allowed during the study or during the last month preceeding the study. Oxazepam or nitrazepam were allowed for sedation or sleep inducement. Safety, tolerability, potential antipsychotic effect, and drug effects on monoamine metabolites in serum and CSF and prolactin in serum were evaluated. Central D2-dopamine receptor occupancy was determined by positron emission tomography. Ten male patients (mean age 32.4) fulfilling DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia were included in the study. Nine of these patients completed 4 weeks' treatment with ritanserin 10 mg b.i.d. The clinical effect was evaluated by means of CPRS and SANS and significant improvement was seen after 4 weeks' treatment both in positive and negative symptoms. Ritanserin was well tolerated and no extrapyramidal symptoms or akathisia were seen. Concentrations of monoamine metabolites and prolactin did not change during treatment. Ritanserin did not occupy D2-dopamine receptors. Thus, no indications of any D2-dopamine-antagonistic activity were obtained. All patients had expected ritanserin levels in plasma during the whole study. This first study of a selective serotonin-2 antagonist in the treatment of acute schizophrenic patients demonstrated significant clinical effects. However, the open design of the study does not allow us to conclude with any certainty that the patients' improvement was due to a specific blockade of serotonin-2 receptors or unspecific factors, although a direct D2-dopamine blockade could be ruled out. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We report a trial of clozapine (CLO) in patients with spasmodic torticollis (ST). In an open-design trial we treated five patients with adult-onset ST with CLO (300 mg/d) over 12 weeks and one patient over 3 weeks. We videotaped the patients three times (before and at the end of CLO treatment, and 2 weeks after CLO withdrawal) according to a standardized protocol. At the end of the treatment period, CLO plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 371 ng/ml. In all six patients, analysis of the video ratings and patients' self-assessments failed to reveal any improvement of ST. These preliminary results fail to confirm any therapeutic benefit of CLO in the treatment of ST.

AB  - Following 4 weeks on placebo, eighteen patients with bradycardia‐ tachycardia syndrome (BTS) were treated with 100 mg xamoterol twice daily for 2‐4 weeks. Ambulatory 24 h Holter electrocardiogram recordings showed that xamoterol decreased maximum heart rate from 140 +/‐ 5.1 to 107 +/‐ 6 beats min‐1 (P < 0.001) during exercise, increased minimum heart rate from 43 +/‐ 1.7 to 51 +/‐ 2.4 beats min‐1 (P < 0.005) at night and shortened maximum duration of sinus arrest from 3438 +/‐ 484 to 1767 +/‐ 202 ms (P < 0.005) in BTS. Symptomatically, patients reported that palpitations were improved and syncopal attacks disappeared. Although the study has the limitation of an open design, effects of treatment were objectively evaluated using Holter monitoring by investigators who reviewed the recordings in a blinded manner. The findings suggest that xamoterol may be useful in the treatment of BTS. Further studies are needed to evaluate fully its therapeutic potential in this condition. 1994 The British Pharmacological Society

AB  - Examination of lung washings from primitive air-breathing fishes (ropefish, bichirs, and gar) revealed a lipid-based surfactant with an average disaturated phospholipid-to-total phospholipid ratio five times lower than in mammals. The lung lavage of fishes was exceptionally rich in cholesterol, resulting in average cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios three times higher, and cholesterol-to-disaturated phospholipid ratios nearly 15 times higher, than those of mammals. Removal of lung surfactant doubled the pressures necessary to initially open the anterior regions of collapsed lungs in all three fish species but had little or no effect on pressures required to fill the lung (i.e., compliance) after the initial opening. The elevated cholesterol content found in pulmonary surfactant of these fishes is consistent with such findings in other ectotherms, suggesting that the proportional elevation of cholesterol may serve to stabilize the fluidity of the lung surfactant over broader temperature ranges. The influence of surfactant on lung opening pressures rather than on compliance contrasts with that seen in mammals and supports an 'antiglue' role of pulmonary surfactant in the simpler open-design lungs of lower vertebrates.

AB  - 239 patients with streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis completed treatment with phenoxymethyl penicillin 12.5 mg per kg body weight b.i.d. for 10 days. At examination after completing therapy, throat specimens from 53 patients (22% yielded growth of group A streptococci of the same T-type as the initial culture (bacterial treatment failure). 20 of these 53 (38% had symptoms and signs of tonsillitis (clinical and bacterial treatment failure). 48 of the patients with bacterial failure were randomly allocated to phenoxymethyl penicillin or clindamycin in an open design; 22 of them received a second course of phenoxymethyl penicillin for 10 days and 26 were given clindamycin, 6.5 mg per kg body weight b.i.d. (children) or 300 mg t.i.d. (adults) for 10 days. After completing their treatment, 14 of 22 patients (64% given phenoxymethyl penicillin harboured the same T-type as in the previous two cultures, while group A streptococci were not recovered from any of the 26 patients receiving clindamycin. In patients with clinical failure after phenoxymethyl penicillin treatment, a new course with this drug is not motivated. In that situation clindamycin seems to be an efficient choice. © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The unilamellar liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, AmBisome, is composed of hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine, distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol and cholesterol. Early studies of its efficacy in an open design showed that remissions could be induced in candidosis and aspergillosis and that doses of up to 5 mg/kg could be used. Adverse events were infrequent, with the main abnormality seen being hypokalaemia in about 18% of patients. Subsequent developments have extended this work. AmBisome has been used in two open studies of patients with invasive aspergillosis; in one of these remission was achieved in 77% of 17 patients with confirmed infection who had failed to respond to conventional amphotericin B. In AIDS patients with cryptococcosis AmBisome given for 6 weeks at 3 mg/kg daily produced mycological remission of meningitis in 67%. Other infections treated with the drug include zygomycete (mucormycosis) and Fusarium infections. AmBisome has also been used as preventative therapy in bone marrow transplant recipients and was found to reduce fungal colonisation rates. There were fewer systemic fungal infections in the treated versus placebo groups although this did not achieve statistical significance. Lack of renal and liver toxicity or anaemia has been confirmed in subsequent studies. In addition febrile reactions to the AmBisome are rare. The drug has also been used effectively in children, including infants, with systemic fungal infections. In visceral leishmaniasis patients, including HIV positive individuals, remissions have been obtained using drug regimens of 1-2 mg/kg of 2·1 days and 3 mg/kg for 10 days. © 1994 The British Society for the Study of Infection.

AB  - Objective: Since GH substitution therapy is now available for adult GH deficient patients, information on the cardiovascular effects of GH substitution has assumed major clinical interest. We have therefore assessed cardiovascular effects of short and long-term growth hormone substitution therapy in these patients. Patients and measurements: Doppler echocardiography was performed in 21 GH deficient patients after 4 months placebo and 4 months GH therapy, in a double blind cross-over study. In an open design study, 13 patients were reinvestigated following 16 months and 9 patients following 38 months of GH therapy. Twenty-one age and sex-matched normal control subjects were also investigated. Results: Heart rate was increased in placebo treated patients as compared to controls. After 4 months of GH treatment, heart rate showed a further increase (10%, P < 0.01) and seemed to remain elevated after 16 months of GH therapy. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower in placebo treated patients than in controls, and did not change significantly after GH treatment. The left ventricular diastolic diameter was reduced In patients as compared to controls, but Increased after 4 months GH therapy (P > 0.05) and seemed to Increase further during prolonged GH treatment. Cardiac index was at the same level in controls and In placebo-treated patients, but increased by 20% following GH therapy and remained elevated after 16 and 38 months (P < 0.05) of GH substitution. Conclusion: Following GH substitution in GH deficient adult patients, left ventricular diastolic dimensions increased and seemed to normalize, while heart rate and cardiac output were found to be increased to supranormal levels.

AB  - Objective: To examine the physiologic consequences and costs associated with two methods of endotracheal suctioning: closed vs. open. Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: An eight-bed trauma intensive care unit (ICU) in a 460-bed level I trauma center. Patients: The study included 35 trauma/general surgery patients (16 in the open suction group, 19 in the closed suction group) who were treated with a total of 276 suctioning procedures (127 open, 149 closed). Measurements and Main Results: Physiologic data collected after hyperoxygenation, immediately after suctioning, and 30 secs after suctioning, were compared with baseline values. Open endotracheal suctioning resulted in significant increases in mean arterial pressure throughout the suctioning procedure. Both methods resulted in increased mean heart rates. However, 30 secs after the procedure, the open-suction method was associated with a significantly higher mean heart rate than was the closed method. Closed suctioning was associated with significantly fewer dysrhythmias. Arterial oxygen saturation and systemic venous oxygen saturation decreased with open suctioning. In contrast, arterial oxygen saturation and systemic venous oxygen saturation increased with the closed suction method. There was no difference between the two methods in the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia. Open endotracheal suctioning cost $1.88 more per patient per day and required more nursing time. Conclusions: The closed suction method resulted in significantly fewer physiologic disturbances. Closed suctioning appears to be an effective and cost-efficient method of endotracheal suctioning that is associated with fewer suction-induced complications.

AB  - The effects on weight gain and eating behavior and the acceptability of dexfenfluramine (Isomeride®) given for five weeks with a diet during smoking cessation were evaluated using an open design in 59 overweight patients who wanted to quit smoking but were concerned that this might further increase their weight. Patient characteristics were as follows: mean weight 80.4 ± 1.8 kg; mean excess weight 26.8 ± 2.2% above the theoretical ideal weight; and mean body mass index 27.9 ± 0,5 kg/m2. This study, which was conducted in 1991, was done without nicotine replacement therapy. At each visit, body weight was measured, eating behavior was evaluated using self-administered scales, and smoking cessation was assessed. Body weight decreased (mean 4.1 ± 2.5 kg) or remained unchanged in 72% of patients despite cessation of smoking. Only 28% of patients gained weight. Weight loss was accompanied with decreased craving for sweet and starchy foods in two-thirds of cases. Body weight changes and craving for sweet foods were correlated. The satisfactory data on the acceptability and safety of dexfenfluramine are confirmed in this study. Three-fifths of the patients reported no cigarette use after five weeks. Relapses were more common in subjects with severe nicotine dependency and less motivation to quit. Currently, nicotine replacement therapy significantly increases the quit rate and improves patient comfort during the withdrawal period. However, weight gain remains a cause of relapse and requires dietary therapy and, in some instances, short-term specific pharmacotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the clinical trials carried out in Spain and published in international journals. The present study has analyzed this situation over the period from 1981 to 1990. METHODS: Spanish studies including "clinical trial" as a key word present in Excerpta Medica CD (Drugs and Pharmacology) or MEDLINE in the CD-ROM version were evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one original articles were obtained. The number of clinical trials was relatively stable from 1981 to 1986 (n = 8.15) increasing to a maximum from 1986 to 1988 (n = 64) with a posterior decrease. The languages of publication were English (51%) and Spanish (49%). A significant increase was observed in the number of articles published in English (p < 0.01) in the last five years. Phase III and IV clinical trials were the most frequent (89%) followed by those of phase II (9%) and phase I (2%). The open design predominated in the phase III-IV trials (58%) over the double blind trials (37%) and the single blind trials (5%). Among the former 70% were comparative and 57% followed randomized treatments. The clinical trials were published in 112 journals, Medicina Clínica (n = 32) and Current Therapeutic Research Clinical and Experimental (n = 6) were the most frequently used in Spanish and English, respectively. Two hundred sixty-three drugs were studied in the clinical trials, cisplatin was the most frequently studied (n = 10). The most commonly studied pharmacologic groups were antiinfectious (n = 40) and cytostatic (n = 35). The number of randomized clinical trials increased significantly after 1986 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the number of clinical trials published in international journals was observed with preference for publication in English. The growing presence of randomized double blind clinical trials suggests an improvement in the quality of the clinical trials performed in Spain, particularly after 1986.

AB  - Lithium (Li) reduces brain inositol levels by inhibiting the enzyme inositol monophosphatase. The enzyme inositol-1-phosphatase was measured in human erd blood cells of controls, Li-free bipolar patients, and Li-treated bipolar patients and was found to be reduced by 80% in Li-treated bipolars, thus supporting the concept that chronic Li at therapeutic concentrations inhibits this enzyme. Two behaviors in rats caused by Li, reduction of rearing, and Li-pilocarpine seizures, are reversed by intracerebroventricular replenishment of inositol. The reversal is stereospecific to the naturally occurring myo-inositol; whereas the stereoisomer L-chiro-inositol is ineffective. The reversal is dose-dependent, requiring a dose consistent with known quantities of brain inositol depletion; and is time-dependent, as inositol must be given 1-8 h before stimulation. High-dose peripheral inositol also reverses limbic seizures induced by Li-pilocarpine, and using gas chromatography was shown to increase brain inositol levels that had been reduced by Li treatment. Low-dose inositol could be shown to reverse a peripheral Li-induced side effect, polyuria/polydipsia, in rats and in patients treated with Li. A higher dose of inositol markedly reduced Hamilton Depression Ratings in 9 of 11 unipolar major depressive disorder patients previously unresponsive to tricyclics, in an open design, but had no effect on chronic schizophrenics in a controlled double-blind randomized crossover trial. A new inositol monophosphatase inhibitor, a fungal product originally discovered as a complement inhibitor, was found to act like Li and lower the seizure threshold for subconvulsant doses of pilocarpine. These data suggest that inositol monophosphatase inhibition is a key mechanism of Li's therapeutic action and that design of new inositol monophosphatase inhibitors may be a practical strategy to create new compounds with Li-like therapeutic effects. © 1993.

AB  - In an open design, randomised, two-way cross-over study, a single 2 mg i.v. dose and a single 30 mg oral dose of flumazenil were each administered to a group of healthy young (n=6) and elderly (n=12) volunteers (male: female 2/1). Plasma samples were collected at intervals and intact drug was assayed. Both the IV and oral doses of flumazenil were very well tolerated by both age groups and no severe or unexpected adverse effects were observed. The main complaints were dizziness and headache, mainly after oral dosing, probably due to the higher Cmax and AUC following this route of administration. After 2 mg i. v. the disposition parameters in the two age groups (elderly/young) were very similar: volume of distribution (Vss): 0.88/0.901·kg-1; total body clearance (ClPL): 0.86/0.99 l·min-1; terminal elimination half-life (t1/2β): 1.02/0.91 h. After the 30 mg oral dose the mean Cmax of 87.6 ng·ml-1 (elderly) and 78.4 ng·ml-1 (young) were generally reached within 0.5 to 1 h. In 26% (elderly) and 23% (young), the absolute bioavailability of flumazenil was very similar. It is concluded that the absorption and disposition paramters of flumazenil were not significantly affected by aging. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The ARIADNE approach to computer-aided synthesis and modeling of analog circuits is presented. It is a mathematical approach based on the use of equations. Equations are regarded as constraints on a circuit's design space and analog circuit design is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem. To generate and efficiently satisfy constraints, advanced computational techniques such as constraint propagation, interval propagation, symbolic simulation, and qualitative simulation are applied. These techniques cover design problems such as topology construction, modeling, nominal analysis, tolerance analysis, sizing and optimization of analog circuits. The advantage of this approach is the clear separation of design knowledge from design procedures. Design knowledge is modeled in declarative equation-based models (DEBMs). Design procedures are implemented into general applicable CAD tools. The ARIADNE approach closely matches the reasoning style applied by experienced designers. The integration of synthesis and modeling into one frame and the clear separation of design knowledge from design procedures eases the process of extending the synthesis system with new circuit topologies, turning it into an open design system. This system can be used by both inexperienced and experienced designers in either interactive or automated mode. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - BACKGROUND. Circulatory shock has been accepted as a consequence of a chain of biochemical events beginning with production of proteases and ending with an uncontrolled generation of oxygen radicals. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the efficacy of gabexate-mesilate (FOY) in circulatory shock in man. Gabexate-mesilate is a new wide-range synthetic protease inhibitor that also has antioxidant properties. DESIGN. Clinical multicenter study with open design that has been compared with some Japanese controlled studies performed using identical parameters and very similar protocols. EXPERIMENTS. 59 shocked patients were treated with FOY in 9 italian intensive therapy units. Circulatory shock was traumatic (n = 14), traumatic-hemorrhagic (n = 25), septic (n = 11) or of mixed type (n = 9). Evaluation of seriousness of shock on beginning of therapy and during the follow-up period was performed on the basis of the same "shock score" (Ogawa and Fujita, Jap J Surg 12:122, 1982) that was used in Japanese clinical studies on FOY in shock. 1.45 mg/kg/hour of FOY were injected i.v. during 48 hours. Conventional therapy was permitted but steroids and aprotinin were excluded. The follow-up period was 9 days. RESULTS. 8 patients died. The mean initial score of the survivors was 8.2; after 8 hours it was 5.0 and after 12 it was 4.0. No adverse reactions were reported. The above quoted survival was greater than that of Japanese studies although the initial score was quite the same. However these studies were controlled and demonstrated gabexate-mesilate to be significantly more active in shock therapy than placebo. They also demonstrated an activity of FOY greater than that of aprotinin when shock was associated to acute respiratory insufficiency and to coagulopathies. CONCLUSIONS. Gabexate mesilate might be useful in therapy of circulatory shock due to its wide-range inhibition of proteases and to its antioxidant properties.

AB  - EMS design has traditionally been a top-down process, in which a single vendor provides the algorithms, software and hardware to meet the utility's functional specifications. Recent trends in power systems, such as the move by utilities to Open Systems architectures, and the development of distributed computing systems indicate that this process must be changed to incorporate the new expertise required in EMS design. We propose an Open Design Approach to accomplish this. Our design approach is based on decomposing the EMS design problem according to different levels of abstraction. We define the components of this decomposition and discuss their relationships. These components form the conceptual design for a CAD simulation package which is being developed at UC Berkeley to evaluate and compare the performance of alternative designs. © 1993 IEEE

AB  - Radiative cooling of IR space telescopes is an alternative to embedding within massive cryostats and should offer advantages for future missions, including longer life, larger aperture for a fixed spacecraft size, lower cost due to less complex engineering, and easier ground handling. Relatively simple analyses of conventional designs show that it is possible to achieve telescope temperatures in the range of 25 to 40 K at distances from the sun of about 1 AU. Lower temperatures may be possible with "open" designs or distant orbits. At ∼ 25 K, an observatory will be limited by the celestial thermal background in the near- and mid-IR and by the confusion limit in the far-IR. We outline here our concept for a moderate aperture (∼ 1.75 m; Ariane 4 or Atlas launch) international space observatory for the next decade. © 1993.

AB  - The action of simvastatin on serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apo) was investigated in 12 patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. After a 2-week placebo baseline and dietary stabilization period, 8 patients received simvastatin 10 mg/day and 4 patients received placebo under a double-blind design for 8 weeks; then all 12 were treated with simvastatin 10 mg/day in an open design for 8 weeks. In the group treated with simvastatin initially, at the end of the 16th week of therapy, simvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apo B, and apo E by 25%, 30%, 25%, and 18%, respectively. The results obtained confirm previous research by other authors and may suggest, furthermore, a mechanism of accelerated clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein remnants. © 1993 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

AB  - The single dose pharmacokinetics of cefoperazone 1g and sulbactam 0.5g, coadministered intravenously, were evaluated in 3 different age groups. Eight healthy young, 8 healthy middle-aged, and 8 healthy elderly adults were studied in an open design. The terminal half-life of cefoperazone (3.0 vs 2.3 hours) was 1.3 times greater in the elderly than in the young subjects and 2.5 times greater for sulbactam (1.8 vs 0.7 hours). Total sulbactam clearance was found to correlate better with age (r = 0.59) than was total cefoperazone clearance (r = 0.40). Volume of distribution, adjusted for bodyweight, remained constant with age. The relationship between creatinine clearance (CLcr) and age in this study is described as (CLcr = −1.37 age + 158.28; r = 0.72, p = 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis of total body clearance versus age and creatinine clearance did not significantly improve the correlation for sulbactam (r = 0.62, p = 0.95) or cefoperazone (r = 0.44, p = 0.87). Sulbactam remained at or above the serum concentrations (8 mg/L) considered to provide optimal synergy with cefoperazone for 1.8, 2.2 and 3.3 hours postinfusion in the young, middle-aged and elderly subjects, respectively. © 1993, Adis International Limited.

AB  - The bronchodilator effect of salbutamol delivered by an inhalation-synchronized dosimeter nebulizer was compared with that delivered by an intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) device in 11 asthmatic patients. The study was a randomized, two-period crossover study with an open design. Salbutamol aerosol was delivered by the dosimeter in successive cumulative doses of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 μg, and by the IPPB device in doses of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg. There were 30-minute intervals between each dose of salbutamol, and pulmonary function was measured both before the drug's administration and 15 minutes after each dose. No dose increments were given once the dose response curve had reached a plateau. The treatments were given on 2 successive days, at the same time each morning. The mean doses required to achieve the highest forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were very small for both techniques-0.41 mg for the IPPB device and 0.17 mg for the dosimeter, the latter being significantly smaller (P = 0.04). The highest FEV1 was significantly better with the IPPB device than with the dosimeter (P = 0.006); however, the highest forced vital capacity was similar with both techniques. We conclude that the dosimeter nebulizer is a drug-sparing, convenient, and efficient technique in aerosol drug therapy. © 1993 Excerpta Medica, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - SYNOPSIS The Regional Migraine Field Trial assessed the efficacy and safety of dihydroergotamine mesylate (D.H.E. 45 r ) for migraine in the office setting. Patients were admitted to the study provided they met the International Headache Society definition of migraine with or without aura. Thirty‐eight neurologists enrolled 311 patients (274 women and 37 men) between the ages of 13 and 70 years in this open‐design study. Ninety‐five percent of the patients had moderate or severe headache pain at entry, and 62% had nausea. All patients received a single intramuscular injection of D.H.E. 45 r 1 mg. A second intramuscular injection of 1 mg was given 60 minutes after the first injection, if needed. An antiemetic was administered concomitantly with D.H.E. 45 r , if needed. Rescue therapy was given at the investigators' discretion. Efficacy was judged by the relief of pain, patients' ability to function, need for a second injection, need for rescue medication, and need for an antiemetic. At 30 and 60 minutes, 46% and 72% of patients had only mild or no head pain, respectively. At 24 hours, 77% of all patients had mild or no head pain. D.H.E. 45 r also improved functional ability. At 30 and 60 minutes, 58% and 75% of patients had only mild or no disability, respectively. At 24 hours, 81% had mild or no impairment. Nausea was present in 62% of patients at the outset, 40% of patients at 30 minutes, and 30% at 60 minutes. An antiemetic was given to 43% of patients at the outset. The presence of nausea was similar whether or not patients received an antiemetic. Rescue medication was needed for 11% of patients, and adverse events were reported by 9%. In conclusion, D.H.E. 45 r is effective therapy for acute migraine. A second dose provides additional relief, if needed. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study with syntocinon (oxytocin) was carried out in 12 patients, nine females and three males with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Patients were treated by intranasal administration of oxytocin spray (18 IU per day) or placebo. No reductions in the number of obsessions or compulsive behaviors were observed in either treatment group. To evaluate whether a higher dosage would exert more beneficial effects, two additional patients were treated with a threefold higher dosage of oxytocin using an open design. In one patient a slight reduction in the number of checking rituals was observed, whereas in the other patient virtually no effect was observed. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that oxytocin might be a potential anticompulsive agent. © 1992.

AB  - In this paper a brief review of user interface management systems (UIMSs) and their advantages is given. Shortcomings of current UIMSs and open requirements imposed by industrial application areas are outlined. Among the most important requirements are uniform design mechanisms independent of interaction media, techniques, and styles as well as a straight forward end‐user adaptability of user interfaces. A new approach to interactive interface construction, called “direct composition”, is introduced. In this approach all interface objects contain the means for their own modification and design and therefore offer consistent interaction techniques for both the construction and usage of user interfaces. Moreover, end‐user adaptability is an inherent feature of direct composition interfaces. The user interface design environment SX/Tools is described to exemplify specific properties of user interface management systems following the principle of direct composition. The impacts of direct composition on user interface design include a uniform interface development process covering tool development, interface development, and “on‐usage” interface adaptation. It is argued that the direct composition approach can overcome many of the problems with traditional UIMSs. © 1992 Eurographics Association

AB  - Low dose metformin (500 mg b.i.d.) was tested in 11 patients with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in an open design. At -1, 0, 1, 4, 7 months the major lipid and lipoprotein parameters, arterial function, and fibrinolytic activity were monitored. Arterial function changes were similar to those found with a high dose (850 mg t.i.d.) metformin [1] but plasma lipids did not change to an appreciable extent. Post-ischaemic blood flow, by plethysmography, rose 30%; the exercise capacity, evaluated by treadmill test, also increased significantly by 105.7% for relative and 53.3% for absolute claudication. Total fibrinolytic activity did not change during the treatment but the antigens of two of the major components of the fibrinolytic system, i.e. t-PA and PAI-1, were significantly reduced at the end of the study. This study gave results quite consistent with those obtained with higher metformin doses, associated with a potentially higher risk of lactic acidosis. © 1992 The Italian Pharmacological Society.

AB  - An open design has been carried out by the authors comparing the efficacy and the tolerance of galactosoaminoglucuronoglycan sulfates (GAGs) with those of ibuprofen lysine in patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA). The experimental group included forty patients of both sexes, aged from 35 to 67 years, with diffuse OA. Ten patients were treated with GAGs administered orally (600-1200 mg/die) and ten patients with GAGs administered intramuscularly (50-100 mg/die); likewise for the ibuprofen therapy two subgroups were formed, such that ten patients were given the drug orally (1500-2500 mg/die) and ten patients had intramuscular therapy (400-800 mg/die). The treatment lasted 40 days. The parameters considered were: pain at rest, pain on pressure, pain on active movement and pain on passive movement. Tolerance was considered by carrying out some routinary laboratory tests and a careful clinical and anamnestic examination. At the end of the study, an improvement in all the clinical variables considered was found in both groups of patients, with no significant differences between the oral and the intramuscular administrations. With regard to tolerance, it must be noted that 10% of the patients in each of the two considered groups patients suffered from gastro-intestinal diseases (pain, nausea, pyrosis). The results achieved, therefore, confirm the efficacy and above all the good tolerance of GAGs in the treatment of OA, characteristics of particular importance for a drug designed for the therapy of a chronic pathology such as OA.

AB  - Computer use for information activities has gone through several stages-mainframes in batch, online access, microcomputers, and LANs. More recently, network interconnection is becoming increasingly important. Growing usage of electronic mail, document delivery systems, and other cooperative arrangements has reinforced the need for standards to allow easier exchange and connectivity between computer systems. Open systems and related standards such as UNIX, X-windows, X.25 networks, and OSI are becoming a necessity, and it is important to take them into account in order to avoid dangers of binding solutions to noncompatible technologies. This paper proposes a framework for open design of databases and related information systems, based on the conceptual model of the OSI layers, and the present trends in computer technology.

AB  - Optimum emergence is necessary to attain maximum crop yields, particularly in reduced and zero-tillage systems. However, zero-tillage seeder performance under zero-tillage conditions is not always adequate, and thus may limit potential yield benefits from this soil and water conserving practice. A study was conducted to measure the range of influence of zero-tillage openers on some soil physical properties of the soil-seed environment. Furrow opener design has direct consequences on soil surface disturbance, furrow compaction levels, and post-seeding soil water requirements in the seed row. While soil temperature and wheat cultivar differed between two distinct field trials, furrow opener designs conducive to adequate compaction of seed furrow with press wheels consistently resulted in better wheat emergence, when soil water potentials were not limiting. This study demonstrates that seeding tool design has a quantifiable influence on seed furrow properties, and that this information can be used to develop precise guidelines for future designs of furrow openers and press wheels. © 1991.

AB  - The specialist enamelling contractor often reduces industrial processing and environment protection dosts, working on the basis of two-component wet enamel or powder enamel. The former enamel employs little and the latter enamel no solvent, and their hydroxyl polyacrylic acid ester/polyisocyanate and inert polyester enamelling techniques are highly environment-friendly. The wet enamel overspray is recuperated. The electrostatic powder enamel spray booth can be of relatively open design because of its freedom from toxic constituents. (R.H.)

AB  - In this multicenter study we compared the activity and tolerability of sodium hyaluronate (HA) and 6-methylprednisolone acetate (6-MPA) administered by intra-articular route to patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. The study was conducted with an open design since different regimens were used for the two treatments. HA was administered once a week for five weeks, and 6-MPA once a week for three weeks. During the two months of follow-up the following parameters were assessed: spontaneous pain, rest pain, load pain, touch pain, joint motion, morning stiffness, and volume of effusion. Ninety patients were treated in all, each randomly allocated to one of the treatment groups. The results of our study showed that both treatments were efficacous in reducing the symptoms linked with osteoarthritis of the knee. The steroid had a more rapid action, which did not, however, last as long as that of HA. Indeed, at the final examination most parameters showed significant differences between the treatments.

AB  - Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) are established single agent treatments for mild hypertension and cardiac failure and are a potent combination in more severe or resistant cases. We have compared the pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat (the active metabolite of enalapril) and HCT in a four‐way comparison of a combination tablet of enalapril (10mg)/HCT (25 mg) with a single dose of an enalapril tablet (10 mg), a single dose of a HCT tablet (25 mg) and simultaneous administration of separate tablets of enalapril (10 mg) and HCT (25 mg) in normotensive volunteers (n = 12, 21–26 years). Each subject received all four treatments and the study was conducted as a randomized, latin square, open design with at least 1 week washout between studies. Overall, HCT was bioequivalent under all conditions and enalaprilat was bioequivalent when given in combination with HCT either as one tablet or as two separate tablets. However, when given with HCT, the mean AUC and Cmax of enalaprilat were reduced up to 20 per cent compared with enalapril administered alone. This is unlikely to be of clinical significance as the differences did not reach statistical significance and the total enalaprilat excreted in the urine over 96 h was similar after all treatments.

AB  - SYNOPSIS The effects of oral Magnesium (Mg) pyrrolidone carboxylic acid were evaluated in 20 patients affected by menstrual migraine, in a double‐blind, placebo controlled study. After a two cycles run‐in period, the treatment (360 mg/day of Mg or placebo) started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued till the next menses, for two months. Oral Mg was then supplemented in an open design for the next two months. At the 2nd month, the Pain Total Index was decreased by both Placebo and Mg, with patients receiving active drug showing the lowest values (P&lt;0.03). The number of days with headache was reduced only in the patients on active drug. Mg treatment also improved premenstrual complaints, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) scores. The reduction of PTI and MDQ scores was observed also at the 4th month of treatment, when Mg was supplemented in all the patients. Intracellular Mg++ levels in patients with menstrual migraine were reduced compared to controls. During oral Mg treatment, the Mg++ content of Lymphocytes (LC) and Polymorphonucleated cells (PMN) significantly increased, while no changes in plasma or Red Blood Cells were found. An inverse correlation between PTI and Mg++ content in PMN was demonstrated. These data point to magnesium supplementation as a further means for menstrual migraine prophylaxis, and support the possibility that a lower migraine threshold could be related to magnesium deficiency.

AB  - Growth hormone treatment in GH-deficient adults has proved beneficial in recent short-term trials, but long-term results have not yet been reported. Thirteen GH-deficient adults (4 females, 9 males; mean (SEM) age 26.4 (1.7) years), who had completed 4 months of GH therapy in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study were followed, for further 16.1 (0.8) months of uninterrupted GH therapy in an open design. A significant mean increase of 1.3 cm in linear height was recorded, whereas body mass index remained unchanged. Mean muscle volume of the thigh, estimated by computerised tomography, increased significantly compared with that of the initial placebo period (p=0.01), and a slight decrease was recorded in adipose tissue volume of the thigh (p=0.10) and subscapular skinfold thickness (p=0.10). Still, the muscle to fat ratio of the thigh was significantly lower compared with that of normal subjects (72.6/27.4 vs 77.9/22.1) (p&lt;0.01). The mean isometric strength of the quadriceps muscles increased significantly during long-term GH therapy (p&lt;0.01), but remained lower compared with that of normal subjects (1.66 (0.10) vs 2.13 (0.11) Nm/kg body weight). Exercise capacity performed on a bicycle ergometer increased significantly after long-term therapy (p&lt;0.05), but still did not reach the values seen in normal subjects (22.5 (3.4) vs 37.4 (4.2) watt · min · kg-1). No adverse reactions were recorded during long-term therapy and hemoglobin A(1c) remained unchanged. These data suggest that long-term GH replacement therapy in GH-deficient adults has beneficial effects on several physiological features which are subnormal in these patients.

AB  - study objective: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and hypocholesterolemic effect of an aluminum hydroxide-containing antacid in hypercholesterolemic individuals. design: A prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled phase of 2 months' duration, followed by an open-design treatment phase of 2 months' duration and a washout phase of 2 months' duration. setting: Family practice clinics of two rural communities (kibbutzim) in Israel. patients: Fifty-six men and women with hypercholesterolemia (type IIa or IIb). Fifty individuals completed the study. intervention: After 2 months of dietary modification (low-fat, low-cholesterol diet), the participants were randomized into two matched groups. Group 1 (28 participants) was treated for 2 months with a chewable antacid tablet containing simethicone, magnesium hydroxide, and 113 mg of aluminum hydroxide per tablet, at a dose of two tablets four times daily. Group 2 (22 participants) was given a similar number of placebo tablets for 2 months. During the following 2 months, both groups received the antacid at the above dose. measurements and main results: Lipoprotein levels were evaluated at baseline and every 2 months thereafter for 6 months. Compared with pretreatment levels, Group 1 experienced a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 9.8% after 2 months (p <0.001) and 18.5% after 4 months (p <0.001). Compared with Group 2, the decrease in LDL-C in Group 1 was 6.2% at the end of the 2-month double-masked placebo phase. Although the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was also reduced in Group 1 at the end of 4 months of therapy (10.2%), the HDL-C/LDL-C ratio increased by 13% during the same interval (p <0.05). The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal side effects. conclusions: An aluminum hydroxide-containing antacid reduces LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic individuals. Although HDL-C was also reduced to a lesser extent, the overall atherogenic index was improved. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of antacids containing aluminum hydroxide in hypercholesterolemic patients. © 1991.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics and effects of chlormethiazole (91 mg intravenously together with 356 mg orally) on psychomotor performance were studied in 10 young (mean age 29 years) and 10 older (mean age 66.2 years) volunteers using an open design. Chlormethiazole affected psychomotor function and decreased subjective arousal in both age groups. The peak effect was found at approximately 30 min, i.e. at the end of the infusion, and performance returned to normal by 3 h. There was no evidence of increased sensitivity of the older subjects to the psychomotor or subjective effects of chlormethiazole. The incidence and type of reported symptoms was also similar in the two age groups. The volume of distribution of chlormethiazole was greater in the old than in the young subjects as was the elimination half-life after intravenous administration. Other pharmacokinetic variables showed no significant differences between young and old subjects. © 1990 British Geriatrics Society.

AB  - The author reports on the development of an open design framework for use on reduced-instruction set computing workstations. It has been estimated that designers spend as much as 30% of their time on nonengineering work, such as searching for files, correcting errors in data bases, and laboring for days getting a design released from layout to manufacturing. The described system automates all of those processes and more. Because the software knows the location of all the data and how it is organized, it simplifies the use of complex tools and processes.

AB  - AS we enter the second decade of automated geographic information systems, important technology trends are emerging that will have a strong impact on how these systems are used and by whom. No longer are departmental systems hidden in the back room, accessible only to the technocrats. Today, cooperating organizations require an approach through which the system is accessible to a diverse blend of nontechnical users with differing applications. These multiparticipant groups also demand technology capable of managing the distribution of data to these numerous end users. To accommodate these requirements, six important trends have evolved: Continuous geographic coverage, spatial-relational data-base management, topological structures, distributed processing, content management, and open hardware and software architectures. This paper describes these trends and their impact on multiparticipant, multiapplication geographic information systems. © ASCE.

AB  - The antiparkinsonian efficacy and tolerability of CQA 206-291, a novel ergoline derivative with potent dopamine agonist properties, were studied during 2 months of treatment in 72 parkinsonian patients. In 36 de novo patients (patients who have not previously been treated with levodopa or dopamine agonists), CQA 206-291 was studied in an open design, while in 36 levodopa-treated patients, CQA 206-291 was studied in a randomized, double blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design. CQA 206-291 induced in both groups a significant antiparkinsonian effect with an effective dose range of 5-30 mg/day. The spectrum of adverse events was similar to what is commonly observed with dopamine agonists. Further studies are required to assess the putative therapeutic advantages of CQA 206-291 when compared to other antiparkinsonian drugs.

AB  - purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of discontinuous treatments with intranasal salmon calcitonin on bone and calcium metabolism in postmenopasal women and to establish the effects of withdrawing treatment. patients and methods: This report presents data from 26 postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis (forearms fracture) 12 months after withdrawal of a 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy with intranasal calcitonin. The women then resumed treatment with calcitonin 200 IU plus calcium 500 mg daily in an open design for an additional 1-year period. A control group of 19 age-matched women (no forearms fracture) did not receive any treatment. results: At the end of the 3 years, the control group had lost significantly more bone in the forearm (single photon absorptiometry) and spine (dual photon absorptiometry) than had the group treated with intranasal calcitonin for 2 years, whereas the group receiving calcitonin for 1 year had intermediate values. During the year of withdrawal, the rate of bone loss was similar in the women who had received calcitonin and those who had received placebo. Calcitonin was especially effective in women with initially high bone turnover and low bone mass. The bone response in the spine could, furthermore, be estimated by the changes in bone turnover. conclusion: Discontinuous treatment with intranasal calcitonin affects bone and calcium metabolism in established osteoporosis. In women with high-turnover osteoporosis, therapy results in a net gain of bone in both the peripheral and axial skeleton. Response to treatment may be monitored by changes in bone turnover. © 1990.

AB  - Over a period of several months the dynamics and morphology of capsular retraction were analyzed with various capsulotomy techniques and IOL types implanted into the capsular bag or the sulcus. The techniques compared were peripheral and intermediate canopener capsulotomy, intermediate and small letter-box capsulotomy, intermediate and small capsulorrhexis with and without superior incisions. The posterior chamber IOLs implanted were one-piece and three-piece C-loop lenses and, in a limited pilot study, one-piece disk lenses. The authors' results indicate that capsular retraction and the stable position of the implant depend on the type, form, and size of the capsulotomy, the type of IOL and its fixation in the bag or sulcus. Any irregularity of the anterior capsule induces irregular capsular retraction with the risk of IOL decentration. Free-floating anterior capsular flaps may induce formation of iridocapsular synechiae. Contact between the anterior capsular rim and the posterior capsule results in capsulocapsular adhesions, capsular wrinkling, and capsular opacification of the contact zone. In order to avoid these capsulocapsular adhesions the diameter of the IOL optics should exceed that of the capsular opening in endocapsular implantation. However, peripheral capsulocapsular adhesions are necessary to stabilize IOL haptics, which for this reason must be open design. Capsulocapsular adhesions may inhibit migration of lens epithelial cells in secondary capsular opacification. The ideal anterior capsulotomy technique seems to be the symmetrical, small, circular, continuous capsulorrhexis, if endocapsular implantation is desired. However, the technique is mainly designed for phacoemulsification, as a small capsulorrhexis inhibits nuclear expression in extracapsular cataract extraction. The main disadvantage of capsulorrhexis is the formation of an opacifying anterior capsular ring ('retoiridal stenopeic hole') that limits visibility into the fundus periphery. Peripheral can-opener capsulotomy with IOL implantation therefore remains a good alternative

AB  - Tianeptine is a new antidepressant with a tricyclic molecular structure. Its main neurochemical effect consists in an increase in serotonin re-uptake. Its efficacy as antidepressant and its good clinical safety have been confirmed in controlled trials against reference drugs. 1231 patients with DSM III diagnosis of major depression of dysthymic disorder were included in a long-term trial with tianeptine. 510 patients completed the one-year treatment period. The results of a subgroup of 100 patients treated in one of the centres of south-east France will be presented. 47 of these patients completed the trial. This study allowed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy as well as the clinical safety of tianeptine during long-term prescription. Patients were treated in an open design after a 4-7 day placebo washout period. Therapeutic effects were assessed by the C.G.I. items (1 and 2), MADRS, HARS and HSCL. For the evaluation of clinical and paraclinical safety, spontaneous complaints of the patients and CGI-3 were documented; body weight, blood pressure and blood chemistry were also measured. Homogeneity between completers and non-completers was tested before statistical analysis of the clinical effects. Results of completers were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA (time x subjects); Newman-Keuls tests were performed in the case of a significant time effect. End-point analysis was used to test the results of the total sample. Patients completing the trial had a mean MADRS baseline score of 32.8. Given high this score, the patients have to be considered genuinely depressed at inclusion. MADRS scores showed rapid and significant improvement as soon as D14, this improvement continued to be significant up to the third month of treatment. It was also significant between the first and the twelfth month of treatment. CGI-1 mean scores (severity of illness) also showed significant improvement over time. The patients' self-evaluation by means of the HSCL showed the same effects as assessment by the treating psychiatrists. Anxiety scores (HARS) also decreased significantly after two weeks of treatment; this significant improvement continued up to the third month of treatment, comparison of scores between M1 and M12 was still significant. Decrease in anxiety ratings seems to be related to improvement of mood: HARS and MADRS ratings were correlated at all evaluations. End-point analysis of the total sample also showed a highly significant improvement for all variables measuring efficacy. Analysis of clinical and paraclinical variables confirms the excellent safety of tianeptine. Changes in mean body weight and orthostatic hypotension were not found during the trial. The absence of these adverse effects is important for the compliance of the patients. Cardiovascular safety of tianeptine was very good: it did not provoke orthostatic hypotension, modification of intracardiac conduction and heart rate. Mood switches during antidepressant treatment can be considered as an indirect proof of therapeutic efficacy: three manic episodes (DSM III) appeared during the treatment period: two during the first month and the third before the seventh month of treatment. None of the patients had a history of mania. In this long-term study including 100 depressed patients (47 of them treated for one year), tianeptine - a new tricyclic antidepressant - confirmed its therapeutic efficacy and its role in the prevention of relapses as well as its good clinical and paraclinical safety.

AB  - The cost of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is driven by magnetic field strength. Misperceptions as to the impact of field strength on performance have led to systems that are more expensive than they need to be. Careful analysis of all the factors that affect diagnostic quality lead to the conclusion that field strength per se is not a strong determinant of system performance. Freed from the constraints imposed by high-field operation, it is possible to exploit a varied set of opportunities afforded by low-field operation. In addition to lower costs and easier siting, we can take advantage of shortened T1 times, higher contrast, reduced sensitivity to motion, and reduced radiofrequency power deposition. These conceptual advantages can be made to coalesce onto practical imaging systems. We describe a low-cost MRI system that utilizes a permanent magnet of open design. Careful optimization of receiving antennas and acquisition sequences permit performance levels consistent with those needed for an effective diagnostic unit. Ancillary advantages include easy access to the patient, reduced claustrophobia, quiet and comfortable operation, and absence of a missile effect. The system can be sited in 350 sq ft and consumes a modest amount of electricity. MRI equipment of this kind can widen the population base than can access this powerful and beneficial diagnostic modality.

AB  - A vertical injection blow moulding machine from the Jomar Corp. U.S.A. is described. The model 115 uses a fully manifolded hydraulic system to inject melted plastic into preform moulds, to index the 3 station turret, to open and close the preform and blow moulds and to strip finished containers. The low hydraulic pressures of 600 to 800 psi generate very little hydraulic shock, promoting longer moulding machine life. The modernized press and plastifier drive circuits are described, together with the special valving and the failsafe open design.

AB  - The efficacy and safety of enalapril, alone or combined with low doses of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were assessed in 183 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mmHg), using an open-design study protocol. After a two-week baseline washout period, all patients received enalapril at daily dosages of 10 to 20 mg to achieve a goal supine diastolic blood pressure of ≤ 90 mmHg. When the treatment goal was not achieved with enalapril alone, HCTZ, at a daily dose of 12.5 or 25 mg, was given in combination with enalapril. There was a significant decrease in supine and standing blood pressure throughout the 12-week study. The desired reduction in supine and standing diastolic blood pressure was achieved in 162 of 174 patients evaluated in the efficacy analysis: 134 receiving enalapril alone and 28 receiving enalapril plus HCTZ. Only minor adverse effects were recorded both with enalapril alone or in combination.

AB  - Nine patients (3 women), aged 29-78 years, with acute asthma were treated with the antiasthma xanthine, enprofylline, in an open-design study without a reference drug. Enprofylline was administered intravenously (i.v.) over 2 h with an exponentially decreasing concentration. This alternative infusion system was found to be simple to handle. All patients but one reached a therapeutic plasma concentration of enprofylline within 20 min, but with a lower peak plasma concentration as compared to what previously has been found with a conventional i.v. injection of the same amount of drug. The plasma concentration of enprofylline remained on a stable and therapeutic level over the 2-h observation period. The effect on lung function was comparable to that found in other controlled trials with enprofylline. A system for i.v. administration of drugs with an exponentially decreasing concentration as an alternative to manually given i.v. injections should be further evaluated. © 1989 Raven Press, Ltd.

AB  - Twenty Nigerians with labile essential hypertension (LEH) were asked to record their blood pressure and pulse rate for 14-16 hours using the Remler Portable Ambulatory Blood Pressure Recorder while exposing themselves to the stress of Lagos traffic. The average blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate for the test day (ASBP, ADBP and APR) were determined in a cross-over randomised open design before (C), after one week on placebo bidaily (P1), after one week on bromazepam 1.5mg bidaily (B), after one week on placebo bidaily (P2) and after one week on labetalol 100mg bidaily (L). Allocation to the active drugs was randomised. All drugs were administered at 8.00a.m. and 8.00p.m. respectively. The maximum blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate MxSBP, MxDBP and MxPR were similarly determined. Both B and L significantly reduced ASBP, ADBP, APR, MxSBP, MxDBP and MxPR but L produced a much greater reduction in the above parameters than B. Side effects observed included drowsiness with B (two subjects) and postural dizziness with L (one subject). Both drugs were effective in controlling LEH but L was more effective than B in reducing stress hypertension. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The antiarrhythmic efficacy and tolerability of encainide and quinidine were compared in an opendesign study in which 50 patients with recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias received intravenous encainide in an initial phase and oral encainide and quinidine in a subsequent, randomized crossover phase. Oral encainide (75 to 200 mg/ day), administered to 47 patients for an average of 4.7 months, was effective in 77%, and oral quinidine (1,200 mg/day), administered to 44 patients for an average of 3.2 months, was effective in 66% of the patients (difference not significant). When the duration of therapy at each crossover period was compared, the percentage of patients who continued to take encainide was consistently higher than the percentage who continued to take quinidine (p < 0.01). Twenty-nine percent of the patients discontinued encainide treatment, 23% because of clinical inefficacy and 6% because of adverse effects. Fifty-nine percent of the patients discontinued quinidine treatment, 20% because of inefficacy and 39% because of adverse effects. Based on antiarrhythmic efficacy, encainide is at least as effective as quinidine in the treatment of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, because of encainide's much greater tolerability, it was distinctly superior in terms of clinical use. This study was an open-design, randomized crossover trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of encainide with those of quinidine in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. © 1988.

AB  - A small scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for studying surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum is described. It has been designed to have a mechanical tip-sample gap instability of less than 0.002 Å while operating in an environment with relatively large-amplitude, low-frequency vibrations. Thermal fluctuations are minimized by built-in thermal compensation. The microscope has a unique coarse z positioner, and an open design for accommodating various types of tip and sample exchanging manipulators. A novel mechanism for fabricating tips of the same length makes it possible to approach the tip and sample without visual access. Atomic-scale images of graphite have been obtained and are presented.

AB  - Liquid ring vacuum pumps/compressors typify the numerous kinds of high capacity apparatus for process plants in general process technology for improving health, work and environment protection in industry handling hazardous products. Their 'open design' incorporating stuffing boxed or mechanical shaft seals, enables toxic substance emissions to be discharged which meet the official specifications. Sealed units of this type with permanent magnet or electromagnet based drives further improve work safety and environment protection. The control systems of the pumps, which can also operate in tandem and in package units (compact plants), give intake pressures of 3-300 mbar, compression at 1013 mbar, and an intake capacity of 25-117 m3/h at an intake temperature of 30DEGREES C on using a 2900 rpm three phase motor of 4.6 kW capacity.

AB  - In an open design study of fifty-four patients with grade I or grade II acne vulgaris, the combination of 0.1 percent tretinoin cream (Retin-A(TM)) and a sunscreen with sun protection factor 15 (Sundown®) was evaluated. Overall study results of the forty-six patients who could be evaluated demonstrated a decrease in papule count of 25.9 percent, a decrease in closed comedones of 49.1 percent, and a decrease in open comedones of 36.3 percent by the end of the eight-week study period. These results indicate that the addition of a noncomedogenic sunscreen to tretinoin did not compromise its effectiveness and successfully prevented photoaccentuation reactions.

AB  - After intravenous injection of a single dose of 2.0 g cefpirome (HR 810) and multiple doses of 2.0 g b.i.d. (11 doses) to 10 healthy male volunteers in an open design, concentrations of unchanged drug were measured at various times in serum and urine over 24 and 96 h, respectively. Cefpirome concentrations were determined using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The biological half-life (t<inf>½</inf>,<inf>β</inf>) found by fitting a two-compartment open model to the data was 2 h. No accumulation of the serum levels could be detected during the multiple-dose phase. Urinary concentrations of unchanged cefpirome effective against most clinically relevant bacteria were detected for at least 36 h. The drug was safe and well tolerated. No drug-related changes were observed for blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, haematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis, including β<inf>2</inf>-microglobulin in serum and creatinine clearance. © 1988 S.

AB  - In order to test seed and seedling responses to direct-drilling (no-till) openers used in optimal soil conditions which subsequently became saturated, 3 opener designs were tested for their effects on barley-seedling performance. This was done in soils regularly saturated with simulated rain or a rising water table, in the presence and absence of surface residue, and under both controlled and uncontrolled temperature regimes. There were strong interactions between opener types and crop residue in both field and laboratory experiments. A winged opener which created an inverted T-shaped groove, together with a hoe opener (U-shaped groove), resulted in greater numbers of emerged seedlings and of earthworms, together with higher root and shoot weights and oxygen diffusion rates around the groove profiles, than did the V-shaped grooves created by a triple-disc opener. The latter device pushed part of the residue into the grooves, where it contacted the seed and reduced emergence, whereas with the winged and hoe openers residue was an advantage. These effects were consistent, regardless of whether soil saturation was due to simulated rainfall or to a simulated temporary rising water table; and whether ambient temperatures prevailed or temperatures were controlled in a warm-wet glasshouse regime. © 1988.

AB  - Abstract. A double‐blind randomized study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. The study comprised 52 patients admitted to an intensive care unit because of suspected pure or mixed benzodiazepine poisoning. The degree of consciousness was assessed according to a modified Glasgow Coma Scale (MGCS), graded from 4 to 20, immediately before and at consecutive intervals after an i.v. injection of flumazenil or placebo. If there were no clear signs of arousal within 5 min after the blind injection, an injection of flumazenil was given in open design. Five minutes after the blind administration of active drug the MGCS score was increased by an average of 7.4 (p<0.001) in the flumazenil group. In the placebo group the average MGCS score of 7.8 on admission was not significantly increased by placebo, but 5 min after flumazenil injection it had increased by 7.3 to 15.1 (p<0.001). Patients who had ingested both alcohol and benzodiazepines were aroused as promptly and clearly (MGCS +8.8; p<0.001) as those who had taken benzodiazepines alone (MGCS +8.4; p<0.001). The patients poisoned with a combination of benzodiazepines and other hypnotic drugs responded less, but still highly significantly (MGCS +5.8; p<0.001). Flumazenil was well tolerated and the safety of the antidote seems acceptable. It is concluded that flumazenil can facilitate differential diagnosis and that it is an effective tool in the treatment of drug overdosage when benzodiazepines are involved. 1988 Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine

AB  - Design considerations and initial results are presented for a new type of time-of-flight photoelectron spectrometer which is particularly suited to the study of cold metal and semiconductor cluster anions prepared in a supersonic molecular beam. The desired cluster is extracted from the molecular beam, mass-selected after an initial time-of-flight, and decelerated as it enters the photoelectron spectrometer. Photoelectrons ejected from the cluster by an ArF excimer laser are collected with &gt;98% efficiency in an intense pulsed magnetic field of carefully controlled divergence. This divergent field parallelizes the photoelectron trajectories and maps smoothly onto a low, uniform magnetic field which guides the electrons along a 234-cm flight tube leading to a microchannel-plate detector. The strong magnetic fields and simple, open design provide excellent rejection of stray photoelectrons in a clean, ultrahigh-vacuum environment. The UPS spectrum of Si20- is given as an example.

AB  - After intravenous injection of single doses of 1.0 g of cefpirome (HR 810) and multiple doses of 1.0 g b.i.d. for five days to the same ten healthy male volunteers in an open design, concentrations of unchanged drug were estimated at various times in serum and urine, over 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Cefpirome concentrations were determined using both high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a microbiological assay. The measurements obtained were compared by linear distribution independent regression, and were found to be equivalent, indicating no major antimicrobially active metabolites of cefpirome. Biological half-life (t1/2,β) was determined by fitting a two-compartment open model to the data: t1/2,β was 2 h (HPLC, median values). During the multiple dose phase of cefpirome (1.0 g b.i.d.) no accumulation of the serum levels could be detected with this dosage regimen. Urinary concentrations of unchanged cefpirome remained clearly above the minimal inhibitory concentration for Escherichia coli (0.03 mg/l) for about 36 h (microbiological assay). The general tolerance was good. © 1987 MMV Medizin Verlag GmbH München.

AB  - This paper describes the outcomes of a one-year pilot research study and outlines the routes for the two-year wider study to follow. The research was prompted by the growing interest in the UK in design and its contribution to business performance, and the need to replace anecdote about 'best practice' in organizing and utilizing design, with information about more 'general' practice. After defining design as 'a course of action for the development of an artefact' and suggesting that design activity pervades organizations, the paper describes the methodology used to examine how design is organized. Using matrices to explore the interaction of design with other business functions the report suggests that 'silent design' (that is design by people who are not designers and are not aware that they are participating in design activity) goes on in all the organizations examined, even those which have formal design policies and open design activities. It is the scope and nature of 'silent design', and its conflict and/or cooperation with formal design activity, which will form the basis for the hypothesis on which the wider investigation will be built. © 1987.

AB  - Up to date 6 patients with initial presenile idiopathic cognitive decline (PICD) and 5 suffering from a presenile Alzheimer-type dementia (PAD) with a mean age of 59.5 were admitted to the trial. The 6 PICD patients were assigned to a double-blind nicergoline/placebo 6-month course with an oral dose of 30 mg twice a day. PAD patients were treated in an open design (nicergoline oral dose 30 mg twice a day) for at least 6 months. Until now only 4 PICD and 3 PAD patients have been treated regularly for 6 months. Two of 4 PICD patients showed a progressive enhancement of contingent negative variation (CNV), shorter reaction time (RT) and an improvement of clinical status. The other 2 PICD patients, on the contrary, showed a progressive mild worsening of CNV-RT and clinical patterns. The double-blind trial is not yet completed. CNV activity, RTs and clinical patterns progressively improved also in 2 PAD patients while in the 3rd they remained nearly unchanged or minimally worse during the 6-month treatment. The positive nicergoline effect on CNV-RT and clinical status noted in our patients appeared similar to that observed by other authors with DHEMT in patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type. No adverse drug-related reactions were seen. © 1987 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - In an open-design study 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 was administered orally to 17 patiens with psoriasis vulgaris at a dose of 1.0 μg/day for 6 months. More than moderate improvement was observed in 13 (76 %) of the 17 patients from 2.7±0.6 months (mean±SD) after the start of treatment. No side effects of the treatment were observed. The mechanism of the effect of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 requires study, but these data suggest that its oral administration is effective for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. © 1986 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

AB  - The commercial criteria affecting the suitability of the many different horizontal guides and feed transfer components for different industrial applications are considered. Various designs of ball bearing races for horizontal movements are shown, including sealed, slit and open designs. The most appropriate design should be selected for the application and the appropriateness depends on whether radial play needs to be adjustable after the race has been fitted. Combinations of linear ball bearings and radial anti friction bearings are also considered. (A.P.)

AB  - Placement of seed and dry fertilizer in separate bands within direct-drilled (no-till) seed grooves has been a difficult design parameter for direct-drilling openers. This paper reports the effects of dry fertilizer placement on seed damage and seedling vigour in direct-drilling systems for rape. Horizontal separation of ammonium sulphate and monammonium phosphate fertilizers and rape seed by 10 or 20 mm was found to be slightly, but significantly less injurious to seeds and produced larger seedlings than vertical separation by 20 mm, which was superior to vertical separation by 10 mm and direct mixing of the seed and fertilizer. Horizontal separation, in fact, resulted in no more seed damage (but larger seedlings) than where fertilizer was absent altogether. Horizontal separation was facilitated by a winged opener design which created an inverted T-shaped slot, although its effectiveness in this respect was diminished when used in a dry tilled soil. In an untilled silt loam soil, separation appeared to be most important at lower soil moisture contents. © 1986.

AB  - Three recent sequential methods, group sequential analysis (GSA), the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and the triangular test (TT) are well suited to randomized clinical trials with a censored response criterion, as they do not require matched pairs of patients. We undertook a simulation study to investigate their statistical properties and to compare these three methods with the fixed‐sample design. Our results suggest that (i) the three methods have the expected statistical properties for size and power; (ii) they allow an important reduction of the average number of events before stopping, except with GSA when there is no treatment difference; (iii) the triangular test (closed design) appears the optimal design, as the variance of the number of events is smaller than with the sequential probability ratio test (open design) and (iv) analysis after every twenty new events does not alter the statistical properties of these sequential methods and enhances their usefulness.

AB  - Active forms of vitamin D3, 1α‐hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1α, 25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3, were administered in an open‐design study to 40 patients with psoriasis vulgaris in three ways: (i)to 17 patients 1α, hydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 1.0μ/day for 6 months, (2) to four patients 1α, 25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 0.5μ/day for 6 months, and (3)19 patients were given 1α, 25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3, was applied topically at a concentration of 0.5μ/g of base for 8 weeks. Improvement was observed at the end of the individual study periods in 13 (76%) patients in Group I with a mean period of treatment (±SD) of 2.7 ± 0.6 months, in one patient in Group 2 at 3 months after the start of treatment, and in 16 (84%) patients in Group 3 when the chemical was applied for 3.3 ± 1.2 weeks. No side‐effects were observed in any of these trials. These data suggest that psoriasis may respond to active metabolites of vitamin D3 and that abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism or in responsiveness of the skin cells to active metabolites of vitamin D may be involved in the pathogenesis of this skin disease.

AB  - 1. Slow release preparations of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs are used to simplify dose regimes in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with the aim of improving patients compliance. This study examines the acute and chronic pharmacokinetics of slow release ketoprofen in 13 rheumatoid patients with a mean age of 59.8 years. 2. Pharmacokinetic parameters following the first dose including Tmax which was 6.92 h (s.e.m. = 0.80), Cmax 3.87 μg/ml (s.e.m. = 0.54), apparent half‐life 8.8 h (s.e.m. = 1.0) and AUC 41.92 μg.h/ml (s.e.m. = 4.02) were not significantly different from those following the last dose after 3 months of chronic treatment, when these were Tmax 6.38 h (s.e.m. = 0.84) Cmax 3.57 μg/ml (s.e.m. = 0.33) apparent half‐life 8.8 h (s.e.m. = 1.1) and AUC 43.18 μg.h/ml (s.e.m. = 5.34) respectively. These results show that no accumulation of ketoprofen occurred with chronic treatment. 3. Clinical assessments were performed in an open design and showed significant improvement in pain, articular index, grip strength and duration of morning stiffness when these parameters were compared to treatment with paracetamol during an initial washout. The drug was well tolerated although there was a trend for the haemoglobin to fall and this parameter should be monitored during therapy with ketoprofen. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Four experiments were conducted to evaluate grain drill performance in no-tillage seeding of spring and winter wheat in the Palouse region of eastern Washington. The drill survey experiment showed similar stands and yields for six drills in winter wheat seeding, except that the highest two in yield were significantly better than the lowest yielder. The opener design experiment showed better winter wheat yeilds for the double disk opener in pea (light) residue, while the hoe openers gave significantly better yields in wheat and barley (heavy) residue. The use of colters did not effect yield but enhanced drill operation in heavy surface residue. The fertilizer placement experiment showed a significant 330 kg/ha (5 bu/acre) winter wheat yield increase for deep banded nitrogen fertilizer compared to broadcast for wheat and barley residue, but no difference for pea residue.

AB  - 51 hypertensive outpatients, whose diastolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mmHg after a 2-week period on atenolol alone (100 mg once daily) participated in this long-term study. They received, in addition to atenolol, the vasodilator cadralazine (ISF 2469; 10 to 30 mg once daily) for a standard period of 24 weeks, according to an open design. Cadralazine caused a progressive and significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, from 173/111 mmHg (end of atenolol alone) to 154/99 mmHg (12th week, p < 0.01/p < 0.01; mean dose, 24.5 mg/day). At this time a diuretic was added as a third-step in 15/51 initial patients (29%), and final blood pressure in all patients was 150/96 mmHg (p < 0.01/p < 0.01), with positive results in 88% of the cases. During cadralazine treatment, heart rate was always significantly lower than before atenolol alone; the most common side effects, many of which were already present during treatment with atenolol alone, included headache, asthenia, dizziness, palpitation and flushing, and tended to disappear spontaneously as therapy progressed. Routine laboratory tests did not show important changes; sodium excretion was not reduced. In conclusion, the therapeutic efficacy of cadralazine, its low or absent salt and water retention effects, its good tolerability, and the high compliance obtained with once daily administration allowed the use of this vasodilator as a second-step drug for long-term treatment of hypertension.

AB  - The aim of this study was to gain experience regarding the efficacy and safety of cimetidine 400 mg nightly for the long-term maintenance treatment of peptic ulcers over three years. The trial was carried out in 44 centres in 12 countries. 1988 patients with endoscopically-proven peptic ulceration initially underwent acute treatment over 6-12 weeks (open study) with 1000 mg cimetidine - the dosage could be increased to 1600 mg daily if necessary. After 6 weeks, 81% of the patients had healed ulcers and the cumulative healing rate after 12 weeks rose to 95%. The statistical analysis of the subsequent long-term maintenance treatment was based on data from 1726 patients (82% with healed pyloric or duodenal ulcers; 16% with ulcers ventriculi and 2% with ulcers subsequent to stomach surgery) who received 400 mg cimetidine nightly over 3 years. Based on life-table analysis, patients who received 400 mg cimetidine nightly during the entire length of the study showed relapse rates of 25%, 36% and 45% after 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. The effect of various prognostic factors on the ulcer relapse rate was examined. Patients who smoked or who were younger than 50 years suffered significantly more relapses and patients with duodenal ulcers also relapsed more frequently. After the open-design long-term maintenance treatment study had been continued over 2 years; one-fifth of the patients who had remained relapse-free were randomly assigned to placebo for one year. In the 3rd year, 36% in the placebo group and 16% of the patients who had continued with cimetidine had relapsed. This difference is statistically significant. Only 21 patients (1%) withdrew prematurely from the study due to side-effects associated with cimetidine. The majority of these withdrew in the first year of maintenance treatment. These results confirm the efficacy and safety of long-term maintenance treatment of peptic ulcers with cimetidine 400 mg nightly over several years with a large patient population.

AB  - When a CH4/N2O mixture was investigated in an ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) mass spectrometer, one, of the ions found at higher resolution of u = 28 was CH2N+. Double resonance experiments showed that the precursors of CH2N+ were N2OH+ and H3O+. This indicated that the ion was being formed by proton transfer to HCN, an impurity generated in situ by pyrolysis or electron bombardment of the CH4/N2O mixture. The formation of CH2N+ was also observed in CH4/N2 and C3H8/N2O mixtures. The formation of HCN should be observable in ion sources of open design, where no precautions have been taken to exclude pyrolysis products from the ionization chamber. © 1984.

AB  - Synopsis: Isotretinoin1 is a new orally active retinoic acid derivative for the treatment of severe refractory nodulocystic acne. The pharmacological profile of isotretinoin suggests that it acts primarily by reducing sebaceous gland size and sebum production, and as a result alters skin surface lipid composition. Bacterial skin microflora is reduced, probably as a result of altered sebaceous factors. Isotretinoin 1 to 2 mg/kg/day for 3 to 4 months produces 60 to 95% clearance of inflammatory lesions in patients with severe, recalcitrant nodulocystic acne, with evidence of continued healing and prolonged remissions in many patients after treatment withdrawal. Doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg/day have also proven successful in the clearance of lesions; however, with such low doses the duration of remission after discontinuation of therapy is usually shorter. Encouraging results have also been seen in small numbers of patients with rosacea, Gram-negative folliculitis, Darier’s disease, ichthyosis and pityriasis rubra pilaris, the response in keratinising disorders resembling that with the related drug etretinate. While long term follow-up studies in these patients have not been reported, prolonged remission after withdrawal of isotretinoin in disorders of keratinisation is unlikely, as with other drugs used in these conditions. Isotretinoin is only partially effective in psoriasis, in contrast to etretinate which is very effective in psoriasis but ineffective in severe acne. Some encouraging results have also been reported with isotretinoin in patients with squamous and basal cell carcinomas, but isotretinoin has proven unsuccessful in non-squamous cell epithelial and non-epithelial cancer. Side effects affecting the mucocutaneous system occur in nearly all patients receiving isotretinoin, but rarely lead to drug withdrawal. Raised serum triglyceride levels are also commonly reported. The possibility of long term spinal or skeletal bone toxicity may restrict the use of isotretinoin in severe disorders of keratinisation requiring prolonged administration. Isotretinoin is strictly contraindicated in women of childbearing potential due to its severe teratogenic properties, unless an effective form of contraception is used. Thus, isotretinoin offers an effective advance on the treatment options available in a difficult therapeutic area — those patients with severe, nodulocystic acne not responding to ‘traditional’ therapy. Pharmacodynamic Studies:In vivo studies in hamsters show that isotretinoin causes atrophy of the sebaceous component of the flank organ by a mechanism not involving androgen inhibition. In patients with acne, isotretinoin (0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day) for 3 to 4 months results in about 90% reduction in sebaceous gland size and sebum production, which may be maintained for prolonged periods after withdrawal of therapy. Skin surface lipid composition is altered to resemble that of a child rather than an adult. The anti-inflammatory effects of isotretinoin remain to be clarified, with preliminary in vitro studies revealing an inhibition of the release of some mediators of inflammation, but inconsistent effects on leucocytic and lymphocytic responses. Isotretinoin appears to have no intrinsic antibacterial activity; decreases seen in the epidermal bacterial population in patients with acne are probably secondary to reduced sebum production. Isotretinoin appears to increase the binding capacity of epidermal growth factor to cells. In animals, oral, subcutaneous and topical administration promotes cellular differentiation causing marked inhibition of the formation of some chemically induced tumours and the growth of transplantable tumours. Pharmacokinetic Studies: Peak plasma concentrations of isotretinoin vary widely among individuals, but usually occur 2 to 4 hours after administration. Steady-state concentrations are also subject to considerable interindividual variation. The disposition of isotretinoin does not appear to alter during multiple-dose administration in most patients. Isotretinoin is extensively bound to albumin in the plasma. The major systemic metabolite of isotretinoin in man is 4-oxo-isotretinoin, and its plasma concentration is about 4-fold higher than that of the parent drug after multiple dosing. The elimination half-life of isotretinoin has been reported as about 10 to 20 hours in several studies in healthy subjects or patients. Therapeutic Trials: Clinical trials with isotretinoin have included a number of studies which were of open design, although patients were said to be unresponsive to previous ‘traditional’ therapy and in that sense could be said to serve as their own controls. Double-blind techniques are of limited value with isotretinoin, due to an easily recognisable side effect profile in the great majority of patients. Therapeutic use has been limited primarily to those patients with severe treatment-resistant nodulocystic acne, and some refractory diseases of keratinisation. At a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day for 3 to 4 months about 65 to 90% of inflammatory acne lesions are cleared, with tolerable side effects in most patients. There is evidence of continued improvements for prolonged periods after withdrawal of therapy, despite a return towards baseline sebaceous gland activity. Lower doses of isotretinoin (0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg/day) have produced similar rates of clearance of acne lesions; however, the duration of remission after discontinuation of therapy appears to be dose related. Rapid and extensive reductions of lesions associated with severe rosacea, and of the skin bacteria counts and lesions in Gram-negative folliculitis, are also seen with isotretinoin treatment. Isotretinoin, like etretinate, appears to be particularly effective in some diseases of keratinisation, particularly Darier’s disease, ichthyosis and pityriasis rubra pilaris, although its use for extended periods in such conditions may be limited by the possibility of long term toxicity. Mean doses of between 1.8 and 2.2 mg/kg/day have resulted in clear improvements in 50 to 70% of patients after 4 weeks’ therapy and in over 90% of patients with a longer duration of treatment. However, the marked clinical reductions in erythema, scaling, inflammation and induration in these disorders regress towards basal disease status upon discontinuation of isotretinoin. Some success has also been seen in a few patients with palmoplantar keratoderma. Isotretinoin is only partly effective in the treatment of psoriasis, although its efficacy is increased in combination with PUVA therapy, and in rare conditions such as x-linked ichthyosis, bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma and pachyonychia congenita. Isotretinoin is ineffective in Hailey-Hailey disease, nevus comedonicus and Netherton’s syndrome. Regression of the pre-cancerous condition, leukoplakia, has been seen in about 90% of patients treated with either isotretinoin or etretinate, but rapid relapse occurs in some patients. In the treatment of carcinomas, isotretinoin has produced a partial response in about 25 to 30% of patients with squamous cell carcinomas, and shown some efficacy in basal cell carcinomas and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, in other non-squamous cell epithelial carcinomas and non-epithelial tumours or malignancies, isotretinoin has been ineffective. Side Effects: The incidence of side effects during treatment with isotretinoin is high. The nature of the side effects resembles hypervitaminosis A syndrome, involving mainly the mucocutaneous system. Cheilitis occurs in about 90% of patients at all doses, while dry mouth, facial desquamation, pruritus, epistaxis and gastrointestinal disturbances, each occur in 20 to 30% of patients at doses of 1 mg/kg/day, and at slightly lower rates with lower doses. However, these side effects rarely necessitate discontinuation of therapy. Conjunctivitis or eye irritation occur in a high proportion of patients at higher doses (about 50%) although at a much lower rate at 0.12 mg/kg/day (about 7%). Ophthalmological abnormalities are not usually seen. Hair loss, the major cause of drug discontinuation with etretinate, is uncommon with isotretinoin. Some troublesome side effects relating to spinal and skeletal bone structure and development have been reported after very prolonged therapy (several years) with isotretinoin. Raised serum triglyceride concentrations are commonly reported, occasionally being elevated into the ‘abnormal’ range. This effect appears to be reversible and related to the dose and/or duration of therapy. Liver function tests are occasionally altered but these are rarely significant. Dosage and Administration: The recommended initial dosage of isotretinoin is 1 to 2 mg/kg/day for 2 or more weeks, with a maximum dose of 200 mg/day in the United States, whereas in Europe and the United Kingdom the initial dose is 0.5 mg/kg/day. Thereafter the dose is individually adjusted according to response and toxicity, being reduced to the lowest effective dose. In acne, the usual duration of therapy is 15 to 20 weeks, although repeated courses may be given if necessary. Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic and is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless adequate contraceptive steps are taken. Isotretinoin showed no interaction with oral contraceptives in a preliminary study. © 1984, ADIS Press Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have investigated the antihypertensive activity of relatively low daily doses of captopril in patients with mild and moderate arterial hypertension. In a first trial, at the end of a 2- week placebo washout period, 18 patients with essential hypertension WHO Stage I or II were treated with captopril, 25 mg three times dairy (t.i.d.), 25 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), 50 mg t.i.d., and 50 mg b.i.d., according to a randomized within-patient open design, with each regimen lasting for a 2-week period. In a second trial, 12 hypertensive patients not adequately controlled by chlorthalidone 25 mg daily as monotherapy (supine diastolic blood pressure at rest > 95 mm Hg), continued the diuretic treatment in combination with captopril, 25 mg t.i.d. and 25 mg b.i.d. according to a randomized within-patient open design. Analysis of variance did not reveal differences between the four captopril dosing schedules (1st trial), or between the two captopril dosing schedules (2nd trial). Both the patients on captopril monotherapy (1st trial) and those cotreated with chlorthalidone (2nd trial) showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure values on each captopril regimen compared to prerandomization values (all p < 0.01). No relevant unwanted effects were noted. We conclude that in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, either untreated or resistant to chlorthalidone, captopril is effective in reducing blood pressure even at daily doses not exceeding 150 mg, without differences between a t.i.d. and a b.i.d. dosing schedule. © 1983 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - This 4-week, open design study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of suprofen (200-1,200 mg/day) in the treatment of elderly patients with pain of diverse origin, all of whom suffered from secondary disorders. All patients reported pain of moderate to very severe intensity upon study enrollment, which improved considerably in 89% of patients by week 1. 12 of the 16 patients reported good to very good pain reduction by week 4. Suprofen was extremely well tolerated by this patient population, and there were no drug- related study withdrawals, These results show suprofen to be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of elderly patients suffering from various painful conditions. © 1983 S.

AB  - Synopsis: Minoxidil1is an orally effective vasodilator which is more potent than hydralazine. The drug induces reflex stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and of plasma renin activity and produces fluid retention. For these reasons, minoxidil must usually be administered in combination with an antiadrenergic agent and with a diuretic. Its acceptability for use in females is limited by the frequent appearance of hypertrichosis. Minoxidil is particularly useful in the treatment of patients with severe refractory hypertension. However, its suitability in the management of male patients with moderate hypertension remains to be determined. Pharmacodynamic Studies: Minoxidil is a potent direct vasodilator, which reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by lowering peripheral resistance. The drug acts predominantly on the arterioles and has little effect on the venous capacitance vessels. Hence, minoxidil blood pressure reduction is associated with an increase in heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac index, and is usually not accompanied by orthostatic hypotension. Minoxidil produces reflex stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, with increases in plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine) levels and in plasma renin activity (PRA). Plasma aldosterone levels increase during acute administration of minoxidil but return to pretreatment levels during chronic treatment. The concomitant use of a β-blocker, such as propranolol or atenolol, or of a centrally acting inhibitor of sympathetic activity such as Clonidine or α-methyldopa, potentiate the antihypertensive action of minoxidil by inhibiting the reflex increase in cardiac output and in renin release. Diuretics also potentiate the antihypertensive activity of minoxidil, by antagonising the sodium-retaining effect of this drug. As with many other antihypertensive agents, the administration of minoxidil in patients with malignant hypertension may be accompanied by a transitory continuing deterioration of renal function to a point where haemodialysis may be required. However, subsequent improvement of renal function may be observed in many patients, sometimes to a degree where haemodialysis is no longer needed. In patients with so-called ‘benign’ hypertension not responding well to ‘traditional’ therapy, better control of blood pressure with minoxidil may prevent the deterioration of renal function which occurs in the majority of such patients. Pharmacokinetics: Peak plasma concentrations of minoxidil usually occur within 1 hour after ingestion. More than 95% of the drug is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Minoxidil has a relatively large volume of distribution of approximately 200L, the drug preferentially concentrating in certain extravascular sites, such as vascular smooth muscle. Minoxidil is metabolised in the liver predominantly by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The drug and its metabolites are minimally protein bound, and are readily excreted from the kidneys or dialysed across the membranes used for haemodialysis. The drug reportedly has an elimination half-life of approximately 3 to 4 hours; however, the duration of its antihypertensive effect may exceed 72 hours. This prolonged activity may be related to the reported high affinity of this drug for vascular smooth muscles. Therapeutic Trials: Most therapeutic trials with minoxidil have been of open design and limited to patients in whom a conventional ‘triple therapy’ regimen (a diuretic, an antiadrenergic drug and a vasodilator) had failed because of ineffectiveness or intolerable side effects. These limitations to use, imposed by the American Food and Drug Administration, were originally justified by experimental evidence of atrial haemorrhagic and degenerative lesions in the dog. These lesions have subsequently been shown to be specific for this animal species. A number of trials have shown that minoxidil can be effective in the management of the most severe and resistant forms of hypertension in adults as well as in children. Some therapeutic trials have shown that minoxidil is a more potent vasodilator and antihypertensive agent than hydralazine. In many instances, this drug has been used successfully in combination as a medical alternative to bilateral nephrectomy. A few studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of this drug in the management of patients with moderate hypertension. However, further clinical experience is needed before the risk-benefits of minoxidil in less severe forms of hypertension in male patients can be clearly ascertained; in females the occurence of hypertrichosis may preclude use of the drug in less severe forms of the disease. Side Effects: Minoxidil therapy is frequently associated with significant side effects, some of which are particularly pronounced in patients with impaired renal function. The drug may cause renal sodium and fluid retention and stimulate thirst. This can lead to peripheral oedema and, in the most severe cases, to congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema. When this problem becomes recurrent or refractory to diuretics or to dialysis, discontinuation of the drug may be necessary. Minoxidil administration has also been associated with pericardial effusion, particularly in patients with severe impairment in renal function. However, the real incidence of this side effect remains to be determined. The use of minoxidil may cause electrocardiographic T-wave changes during the first 2 weeks of therapy. This abnormality is usually not associated with symptoms or with cardiac enzyme elevation and reverts spontaneously. Pulmonary hypertension has been described in patients treated with minoxidil, but a cause-effect relationship is uncertain. Orthostatic hypotension is not likely to occur with minoxidil. Reversible hypertrichosis is a common side effect which appears to some degree in nearly all patients treated with minoxidil for longer than 1 month, and constitutes a serious limitation to the use of this drug in females. Dosage and Administration: The usual initial dose is 5 to 10mg daily in 2 divided doses. (Once-daily dosing can also be used, particularly with total daily doses of 20mg or less.) This dose can be increased slowly (5 to 10mg/day increments every 2 to 3 days) up to 100mg per day. However, the majority of patients with severe hypertension usually respond to a dose not exceeding 50mg/day. Accelerated regimens of dosage increase can be used in patients with the most severe forms of hypertension, to achieve a more rapid control of blood pressure. In patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, minoxidil should be administered after the dialysis, since the drug is easily dialysible. Patients receiving minoxidil who are not on dialysis must also receive sufficient diuretic therapy to maintain salt and water balance. Most patients will also require a sympathetic nervous system suppressant, preferably a β, to limit reflex tachycardia. © 1981, ADIS Press Australasia Pty Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluspirilene, a diphenylbutylpiperidine, is a long-acting injectable neuroleptic because of its gradual absorption and delayed metabolism. Previously used in a 5- to 7-day schedule in chronic schizophrenics, it was studied in an open design for 12 patients suffering acute exacerbations of their schizophrenic disorder in a drug regimen that favored rapid neuroleptization. Injections were repeated as often as daily until control of symptomatology occurred. The average dose for the initial week was 20.3 mgs and this was reduced to 12.7 mgs by the end of the hospitalization period which lasted no more than eight weeks (average 4.6 weeks). This phase was followed by an 8-week out-patient period, BPRS and NOSIE rating scales demonstrated a marked improvement in all but one patient. An extrapyramidal rating scale showed moderate extrapyramidal side effects such as akathisia, rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia. Few other side effects were noted. Fluspirilene seems to be a useful drug in the treatment of acute decompensation of schizophrenic disorders using a regimen favoring a rapid stabilization of dosage. Obviously, controlled studies are needed to verify our conclusions.

AB  - Design requirements for slurry pumps are outlined. These include materials to resist abrasion; for example, austenitic manganese steel is employed where there is high impact gouging abrasion and martensitic white irons are used where there is grinding and erosion abrasion. Closed impeller designs are usually preferred to the open design unless the particles are of fine size. Seals are of the packed gland type, and bearings are normally heavy duty, preferably in cartridge form for quick exchange. (D.A.L.)

AB  - This article highlights the British National Coal Board's new Prince of Wales coal preparation plant which is a key ingredient in a 40-million expansion program in the North Yorkshire area. This modern plant features unusually low noise levels and an open design that boosts safety and production by giving the operator better visual control. The plant will eventually handle 1. 3 million tpy of coal from the more than 100-year-old, but recently revitalized, Prince of Wales mine.

AB  - After the discontinuation of the neuroleptic treatment (open design), 10 out of 30 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients showed before the end of 4 wk a significant increase of their symptomatology. This deterioration made the application of neuroleptics necessary. Before the discontinuation of the neuroleptic treatment the group of patients with later relapse and the group without relapse showed only slight differences concerning psychopathological symptoms but significant differences concerning test performance. After 2 wk without medication a pronounced impairment of performance was found in patients with later relapse. At this time the 2 groups showed no more significant differences in the psychological tests. At the same time significant differences concerning the psychopathological symptoms had developed.

AB  - It was postulated from animal experiments that Γ-endorphin and, in particular, the nonopiate-like peptide [des-Tyr1]-Γ-endorphin (DTΓE, β-lipotropin [β-LPH]62-77) have neuroleptic-like activity. To test this, 14 patients with long-lasting, relapsing schizophrenic or schizoaffective psychosis resistant to conventional neuroleptics were treated with DTΓE. An open design was used first for six patients (study 1) and a double-blind, crossover design for the other eight (study 2). In study 1, all neuroleptic medication was discontinued and 1 mg of DTΓE zinc phosphate was given daily intramuscularly for about seven days. In study 2, six patients were maintained with neuroleptic therapy and two patients were drug free; all eight received daily intramuscular injections of 1 mg of nonlasting DTΓE in saline solution for eight days. There was transient or semipermanent improvement in both studies in which the psychotic symptoms diminished or even disappeared. In study 2, there was a slight but significant improvement with the first treatment. Improvement continued and by day 4, the psychotic symptoms had almost disappeared. No toxic side effects were noted. These effects of DTΓE may be a consequence of the normalization of β-endorphin homeostasis in the brain. © 1979, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tetroxoprim/sulphadiazine (TXP/SDZ) combinations were used to treat hospitalized patients with sensitive urinary infections. After an open design pilot study which demonstrated promising efficacy, good tolerability and negligible toxicity, two comparative trials against trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (co- trimoxazole; TMP/SMZ) were done using a randomized allocation design. After loading doses, TXP/SMZ was given at 50 mg/250 mg 12-hourly in the first comparative study, and at 100 mg/250 mg 12-hourly in the second. TMP/SMZ was used at 160 mg/800 mg 12-hourly throughout. As judged by the eradication of the original infecting pathogen the two combinations had similar overall cure rates (TXP/SDZ 71% of 76 patients, TMP/SMZ 78% of 69 patients, at 2 weeks follow-up). These rates were considered to be satisfactory in this difficult group of patients. TXP/SDZ showed a trend towards being better tolerated than TMP/SMZ, although this was not significant. The toxicity of both combinations was negligible. A study of the pharmacokinetics of TXP/SDZ showed that, overall, both drugs were absorbed as completely as in previous studies using fasting volunteers. Satisfactory concentrations for therapy were achieved in blood and urine, the steady state being achieved in blood on the first day by the use of the loading dose. During one week’s therapy of TXP 100 mg/SDZ 250 mg 12-hourly there was no accumulation of either drug in the blood. © 1979 Oxford University Press.

AB  - Nineteen patients with essential hypertension were studied in an out-patient hypertension clinic. A new antihypertensive combination: reserpine 0.1 mg, clopamide 5mg, and dihydroergocristine 0.5mg (Brinerdine) was orally administered under a placebo-open design. The administration of Brinerdine caused a reduction in mean blood pressure from 131.7 ± 2.97 to 111.0 ± 2.35 mmHg (P < 0.001) in supine position, and from 130.4 ± 3.09 to 109.0 ± 3.18 mmHg (P < 0.001) in standing position. Supine heart rate was not significantly modified by drug treatment; however, it caused a reduction in standing heart rate (P < 0.01). Brinerdine caused a reduction in mean blood pressure before and during treadmill exercise (P < 0.005). There was no alteration by drug treatment in the exercise-induced increase of heart rate. We conclude that Brinerdine is an effective combination for the treatment of arterial hypertension.

AB  - An electromagnetic current sensor with a unique 'open' design was tested for steady flow accuracy and cosine response in the horizontal and vertical planes. The sensor's configuration was designed to minimise hydrodynamic disturbances of the current flow and to offer good linearity and directivity response. Test data revealed the sensor's steady-flow measurement uncertainty to be s2.5 percent of full scale. Hhorizontal directivity errors were less than + or !4 cm/s and 5 cm/s for half and one knot test flows. The major contributor of error for the cosine response was determined to be an imbalance in amplifier gain between the sensor's two measuring ones. Vertical directivity results were too noisy for reliable analysis, and the problem was believed to be caused by a distortion of the sensor's magneticfield during testing. (A) Microfiche .

AB  - 3WE low-voltage circuit-breakers in open design can now also be supplied as four-pole models, with hand-operated mechanisms with high-speed closing feature, with motor-operated storage mechanisms and for installation in different ways. Circuit-breakers rated at 630 to 3150 A, and up to 6000 A when two are connected in parallel, are thus available for installation in switchboards and for the control of major loads. There is a wide range of releases, operating mechanisms and auxiliary switches, most of which are of modular design and can be fitted easily, for matching the breakers to their various duties.

AB  - 83 patients were studied in two trials of naproxen (d 2(6' methoxy 2' naphthyl) propionic acid), a new non hormonal anti inflammatory agent. In the first study, a double blind cross over trial of two consecutive 4 wk periods, naproxen and aspirin, in total daily doses of 500 mg. and 4 g. respectively, were compared in fifty patients with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis. The two drugs proved to be equally effective in controlling this disease as assessed by objective and subjective parameters. Naproxen, however, was much better tolerated, and, in particular, was associated with much less dyspepsia or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The second study, which was of open design and indefinite duration, included 16 patients from the double blind study who had preferred naproxen (because of equal or greater relief compared with aspirin or better tolerance), and 33 patients who had found other drugs less satisfactory, either because of inadequate control (6), or of major adverse effects: gastrointestinal (24) with overt bleeding and radiographically established peptic ulceration (7). Despite the inclusion of many 'difficult to treat' patients, only three of the 27 had persistent adverse reactions to naproxen, and evidence of faecal blood loss was insignificant. Clinical improvement occurred in the open trial in 63%, while 25% remained unchanged. Comprehensive laboratory tests in both trials revealed no significant deviation from normal which could be attributed to naproxen. Thus naproxen in a daily dose of 500 mg. appears to be a safe anti inflammatory and analgesic drug equal in effect to 4 g. aspirin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and is often better tolerated. In addition, patients appreciate the need for only 2 daily doses. No hazardous adverse effects have been noted to date.

Two routes to conserving fuel are open: design; and operation of unit to take advantage of optimum design. A near infinite variety of crude preheat schemes are possible and it takes a computer to find the optimum and a computer to control for maximum advantage. At stake is a fuel savings of 7-10%.

These are 4 and 6-cyl compressors with capacities of 66,000 kcal/hr at -10/ plus 25//0 C, R 22, all of them series-manufactured in both the semihermetic and open designs. With the exception of the semihermetic types that cannot be run on ammonia, the compressors can be used with all commercially- available refrigerants. This article deals with the type of capacity control used, the tandem version made by fitting together two compressor units, and finally, the twin-stage compressor in this series.

AB  - The two aspects of engineering education are the teaching of science and the teaching of design. By “design” is meant the procedure of selecting and combining distinct elements to create complete systems which will perform useful functions. In this paper, the author describes the application of this concept of design teaching at The Technical University of Denmark, after a procedure which includes a sequence of closed and open design projects in both computational and experimental laboratories. © 1965, IEEE.
