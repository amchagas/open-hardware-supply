abstract={With the advent of new generations of personal assistants integrated with voice-controlled devices (e.g., Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, etc.), the demand for efficient mechanisms to detect, localize and recognize the source of sound events is raising up. As such, microphone-array based devices using improved algorithms are of interest for the research community. In this context, the recent success of deep learning algorithms in various domains (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition, etc.) opens the door to their application to the SELD (Sound Event Localization and Detection) problem. Here, the challenge stands on effectively combining deep neural networks (DNNs) with embedded devices driving specific configurations of the microphone arrays. In this work, we propose the QuadCOIN system. It is an embedded system executing the algorithms needed to detect and localize a sound event in the space all around, which exploits a specific arrangement of microphones that improves the precision in estimating the sound source position. Specifically, our system is composed of an embedded computing device coupled with four groups of microphones, each arranged as a small grid of four sensing elements (i.e., four microphone arrays). The embedded computing device collects the estimations of the event localization from the four groups of sensors, and then determines the exact position of the sound source. To this end, each group of microphones runs a cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to detect events of interest. The CNN has been trained using datasets generated through a developed in-house framework. As proof of the feasibility of the proposed system, we implemented it on low-cost hardware, which is composed of a single board computer (SBC) and four ST-BlueCOIN microphone arrays. Experimental results carried out on the QuadCOIN system, demonstrate its precision and accuracy in detecting sound events and localizing the corresponding sound sources. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={We describe a high resolution laser polarimeter built from commodity optical components. The optical rotation angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between two harmonically modulated polarised laser beams – an ‘object beam’ that passes through the sample under test and a ‘reference beam’ that bypasses the sample. The complete polarimeter may be assembled from low cost off-the-shelf parts for less than £300 (UK Sterling). Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of ±0.0013° and a precision of ±0.0028° – comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter’s ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring. The polarimeter is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, and source code for its firmware included as Supplementary Information. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Smallholder farmers often face challenges in managing soil fertility due to limited inputs and high spatial variability on their farms. While improved knowledge of soil constraints could help them manage limited resources more effectively, formal soil analyses are typically out of reach due to high costs of testing and transport associated with regional analytical laboratories. To address these challenges, we assembled a tool kit that uses minimal reagents and low-cost equipment to provide in-field quantitative data that are comparable to formal laboratory methods. We validated our tool kit measurements against standard analyses conducted at national laboratories on soils collected from 36 smallholder farms in Kenya and 115 farms in Peru. Additionally, in Kenya, we evaluated two legume treatments, involving the incorporation of residues from: 1) Lablab purpureus (lablab), versus 2) Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean). The tool kit measurements that were considered include important indicators of soil health (such as permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), available P, pH, particulate organic matter (POM), and aggregate stability) that can influence crop yields and multiple soil functions. POXC and pH measured with the tool kit from Kenyan soils were highly correlated to those measured by a standard laboratory (R2 = 0.77; R2 = 0.56; respectively). The tool kit and standard laboratory available P were less well correlated, but also showed a highly significant positive relationship (R2 = 0.30). Similar patterns were noted for POXC, pH and available P measured in Peruvian soils (R2 = 0.75; R2 = 0.75; R2 = 0.35; respectively). Importantly, the tool kit and standard lab analyses also displayed similar abilities to predict maize grain yield in Kenya. When used to detect soil impacts of incorporating P. vulgaris versus L. purpureus, only POM differed significantly between the two legume treatments, although L. purpureus was slightly higher for most of the beneficial soil health properties. Our findings suggest that the tool kit methods proposed here have broad applicability to smallholder farms for explaining variability in crop yields, assessing soil contexts, and quantifying management-induced changes in soil health. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the increasing interest in high throughput screening and parallel assays, laboratories around the world inevitably find themselves in need of driving a multitude of fluid lines to facilitate their large scale studies. The comparatively low cost and no-fluid-contact design of peristaltic pumps make them the go-to systems for such ventures, but using commercially available pumping systems this still becomes a costly endeavor at typically $250-$1000 per pump line. Here we have developed an alternative, a peristaltic pump that can be fabricated in most research laboratories using 3D-printing and readily available off-the-shelf parts. The pump features 8 parallel channels with linear ranges spanning from 0.7 µL/min to 6 mL/min. The pump can be fabricated and assembled by anyone with access to a 3D-printer at a cost of less than $45 per channel and is driven by a stepper motor that connects directly to any computer. This device has the potential to be disruptive in areas such as drug screening and assay development, as well as lab-on-a-chip applications and cell cultivation, where it significantly reduces hardware expenses and allows for construction of more comprehensive fluidic systems at a fraction of current costs. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Coherent wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technologies have leveraged the optical communication systems in core networks, increasing the fiber capacity by transmission with advanced modulation formats and mitigation of impairments with digital signal processing. However, these solutions are too expensive for access networks, where cost, power budget, and footprint are limited. Hence, the key technology will be developing low-cost coherent transceivers providing an excellent selectivity and giving high sensitivity, which allows high splitting ratios. This paper reports an experimental design of a low-cost coherent ultra-dense WDM passive optical network (UDWDM-PON) with 6.25 GHz channel spacing. The users' optical network unit (ONU) is built employing coherent transceivers with two paired low-cost distributed feedback (DFB) lasers, one as the local oscillator and another as the transmitter, offering simplicity and low-cost hardware; likewise, the optical line terminal (OLT) at the central office can profit from the same design. The ONU DFB lasers have wavelengths with limited thermal tunability, controlled by a thermo-electric cooler, which is used to allocate the wavelengths. A medium access control (MAC) at the OLT manages the spectrum channel allocation for ONUs, demanding connection when activation is requested: the OLT furnishes an optical carrier wavelength for the ONU to obtain connection by a control algorithm, assigning a down-channel and another paired up-channel assigned to the ONU DFB transmitter. The MAC can reassign the channels because of interference or collision in a dynamic wavelength allocation. Measures in an activation process and in channel reassignment have been performed in environmental conditions, including control signals and the physical parameters of DFB lasers, demonstrating the practical viability of the PON scaling from 32 up to 256 wavelength channels. © 2009-2012 OSA.},

abstract={Series dc arc fault creates a fire hazard and negative impacts on the distribution bus if not detected and isolated quickly. However, the detection of a series arc fault is challenging due to the low fault current, lack of zero-crossing, and the erratic behavior of arc discharge based on different power electronic loads and controllers in modern power applications. This article presents a practical and versatile series dc arc fault detection method based on ensemble machine learning (EML) algorithms. A buck converter constant power load (CPL) and a boost converter CPL are designed and built to study the different arc fault behaviors and generate training data for the machine learning algorithms. A set of time domain features is extracted from the experimental data and analyzed using the feature importance attribute. An adaptive normalization function then processed the features to mitigate false positive classification caused by load changes. A two-step algorithm is proposed to recognize the arc fault in different load types. Various EML algorithms and the associated hyperparameters are benchmarked to select the most accurate hyperparameters for a detection algorithm for low-cost hardware implementation. Finally, the detection algorithm's effectiveness is verified with CPL testbed. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

This work presents the Sparsity Independent Regularized Pursuit (SIRP) which achieves an admirable trade-off between these key features. Further, it requires no prior knowledge of exact sparsity level and possesses a regular structure, making it amenable to low cost hardware solutions. Experimental investigations reveal the competitiveness of SIRP with existing state-of-art in regard to successful recovery and significant speed-up. The algorithm also attains superior results on a considerably large image recovery problem, which demonstrates its suitability to real world applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The proposed method interpolates way-points by the combination of a straight line and a fifth-order Bézier curve along which the curvature varies continuously. In addition, a method to generate the associated timing law is proposed such that the robot travels along the curve in near minimum time under the maximum velocity and torque constraints. Since the method aims for an online application, heuristic techniques are applied to minimize the computational cost for finding the optimal solution. The time for computing a complete time-optimal trajectory for a moving robot to transit to a next way-point is only several milliseconds when tested in a personal computer. This result implies that a highly efficient motion control system for a two-wheeled mobile robot can be implemented with a low-cost hardware available today. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Furthermore, the performance of the algorithms on the Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) is investigated as a possible solution to the challenges inherent to on-orbit imaging in the visible, such as diffuse light scattering and eclipse conditions. The Harris, GFTT, DoG, Fast-Hessian, FAST, CenSurE detectors and the SIFT, SURF, LIOP, ORB, BRISK, FREAK descriptors are benchmarked for images of Envisat. It was found that a combination of Fast-Hessian with BRISK was the most robust, while still capable of running on a low resolution and acquisition rate setup. For large baselines, the rate of false-positives increases, limiting their use in model-based strategies. © 2020 IAA},

abstract={Free and open-source hardware (FOSH) is rapidly gaining momentum because it provides customized research hardware with over 90% savings compared to the costs of proprietary tools. However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84–27.7m€/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Open source hardware has developed rapidly since the last 2 decades, thanks to access to Internet and availability of novel interactive manufacturing technologies (for example 3D printing or collaborative platforms). Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388–393, 2018) defined the “open-o-meter”, i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project’s process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects’ process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project’s process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project’s process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Aim: Current pricing of commercial mechanical ventilators in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) markedly restricts their availability, and consequently a considerable number of patients with acute/chronic respiratory failure cannot be adequately treated. Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-tobuild noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cmH2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45±1.68 without support to 2.83±1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80±1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated. © 2020 ERS.},

abstract={Recently in many works, it has been identified that large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (LS-MIMO) is one of the key technologies for achieving extraordinary gains of energy and spectral efficiencies in wireless communication systems. This technology employs low cost hardware which enlightens its significance. The efficiency of single-cell or multi-cell LS-MIMO systems is affected by various factors such as hardware impairments, energy consumption, bandwidth allocation and outdated channel. In this paper LS-MIMO systems have been analyzed with the effects of channel aging or often called outdated channel. New expression for minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) estimate has been derived for LS-MIMO system in downlink (DL). We use three precoding schemes and results show that regularized zero-forcing (RZF) gives better performance than zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio combining (MRT). We also show that how Doppler's shift in combination of outdated channel affects the performance of the system with all the above mentioned precoding schemes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Stream network extension and contraction depend on landscape features and the characteristics of precipitation events. Although this dependency is widely recognized, the interaction among overland-flow generation processes, drainage active length, and frequency in temporary streams remains less understood. We studied a forest headwater catchment with wide variation in soil depth to investigate the runoff generation processes that lead to the occurrence of ephemeral and intermittent flow and connectivity between hillslope and outlet. We used low-cost equipment to monitor the variation in the length of the active drainage network and to measure the water table development. The flow in the channels can develop even under light rainfall conditions, while the connectivity is controlled by antecedent wetness, total precipitation, and active contribution area thresholds. Runoff permanence and fragmentation were related to soil depth variation; flow being usually more disconnected due to deeper water tables in deeper soil locations. Our findings emphasized the impact of soil structure on runoff generation in hillslopes and can be useful in the management of the most active areas and their impact on the quality of available water. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Distributed digital manufacturing offers a solution to medical supply and technology shortages during pandemics. To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses. © 2020 by the author.},

abstract={In recent years we have assisted to a growing interest for embedded vision, due to the availability of low cost hardware systems, effective for energy consumption, flexible for their size at the cost of limited (compared to the server) computing resources. Their use is boosted by the simplicity of their positioning in places where energy or network bandwidth is limited. Smart cameras are digital cameras embedding computer systems able to host video applications; due to the cost and the performance, they are progressively gaining popularity and conquering large amount of the market. Smart cameras are now able to host on board video applications, even if this imposes an heavy reformulation of the algorithms and of the software design so as to make them compliant with the limited CPUs and the small RAM and flash memory (typically of a few megabytes). In this paper we propose a method for gender recognition on video sequences, specifically designed for making it suited to smart cameras; although the algorithm uses very limited resources (in terms of RAM and CPU), it is able to run on smart cameras available today, presenting at the same time an high accuracy on unrestricted videos taken in real environments (malls, shops, etc.). © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way future cities are planned. The concept of embedding intelligence into spaces and objects makes it possible to build all sorts of smart and distributed systems that automate and improve everyday operations in the fields of health, energy, manufacturing, and transport, amongst others. One of the most significant visions to come out of the IoT revolution is Smart Cities. Equipped with sensing and communication technologies and powered by renewable energy sources, Smart Cities could be the key to protecting environmental resources and ensuring sustainable urbanization as the world population continues to grow. Of the various available renewable energy sources, solar is one of the most popular and promising. However, solar energy is a function of its environment, and sudden changes in meteorological conditions can cause intermittency and disrupt power generation. In desert regions where solar energy is the most plausible option for renewable energy, dust-based soiling remains the biggest obstacle. The accumulation of dust particles on the surface of PV modules can obstruct the absorption of radiation by the module, effectively reducing its output. One common method to measure soiling loss is to perform Current-Voltage (IV) Tracing; where the characteristics of a PV module are used to evaluate the performance of the module. However, solar facilities in smart cities are often distributed in the form of small farms, rooftop installations, and parking lot shades in order to make use of the available space and reduce power lines. This represents a challenge to monitoring and maintaining soiled panels due to the scale and distribution of the installations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an IoT-based solar monitoring system for city-wide, large-scale, and distributed solar facilities in smart cities. The system uses low-cost hardware and IoT networking technologies to remotely perform and communicate IV curves from individual modules or strings in a remote facility. A prototype was implemented and used to evaluate soiling loss in Sharjah, UAE, over the period of two months under harsh summer weather conditions. The prototype was able to successfully and reliably collect IV tracing and communicate it back to a cloud-based server for researchers to view and analyze. The obtained results show that soiling has a major impact on PV modules efficiency with up to 40 % power loss after two months of soiling. The PV soiling index and PV soiling loss are evaluated to allow solar facility operators to reduce cleaning costs, optimize power output, and enable preventative maintenance in city-wide distributed solar facilities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The hardware design is protected against the insertion of hardware Trojans during the production phase through netlist obfuscation provided by logic locking. The software stack is based on a trustworthy and verified microkernel. Moreover, the system is expected to work in an environment which does not allow physical access to the device. Therefore, on-the-field attacks are only possible via software.

abstract={In heterogeneous computer architectures, the serial part of an application is coupled with domain-specific accelerators that promise high computing throughput and efficiency across a wide range of applications. In such systems, the serial part of a program is executed on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) core optimized for single-thread performance, while parallel sections are offloaded to Programmable Manycore Accelerators (PMCAs). This heterogeneity requires CPU cores and PMCAs to share data in memory efficiently, although CPUs rely on a coherent memory system where data is transferred in cache lines, while PMCAs are based on non-coherent scratchpad memories where data is transferred in bursts by DMA engines. In this paper, we tackle the challenges and hardware complexity of bridging the gap from a non-coherent, burst-based memory hierarchy to a coherent, cache-line-based one. We design and implement an open-source hardware module that reaches 97% peak throughput over a wide range of realistic linear algebra kernels and is suited for a wide spectrum of memory architectures. Implemented in a state-of-the-art 22 nm FD-SOI technology, our module bridges up to 650 Gbps at 130 fJ/bit and has a complexity of less than 1 kGE/Gbps. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to design and develop a new robotic device for the rehabilitation of the upper limbs. The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process. Design/methodology/approach: The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report. Findings: The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time. Research limitations/implications: There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction. Practical implications: Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices. Originality/value: The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments. Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The aim of this work is to show that a significant increase of the efficiency of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) can be achieved already at an early design stage, through the choice of a turbine and control regulation, by means of an accurate Wave-to-Wire (W2W) modeling that couples the hydrodynamic response calibrated in a wave flume to a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) test bench with sizes and rates not matching those of the system under development.

Moreover, power electronics and electric machines to emulate turbines and electric generators matching the real systems are not low-cost equipment. The use of HIL is important in the development of WECs also because it allows the carrying out of tests in a controlled environment, and this is again time- and money-saving if compared to tests done on a real system installed at the sea. Furthermore, W2W modeling can be applied to several Power Take-Off (PTO) configurations to experiment different control strategies. The method here proposed, concerning a specific HIL for testing power electronics and control laws for a specific WECs, may have a more general validity. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). These non-neuronal cells are able to regulate the neurons activity in the different parts of brain tissue by calcium waves generation in its internal space. Moreover, astrocytes interact with neurons and modulate the spiking activity of them. In this paper, a set of piecewise linear estimations of a three-dimensional spontaneous astrocyte model are presented for digital FPGA realization. This leads to achieve a high-speed and low-cost system in large-scale implementation. In this approach, the three-dimensional original model is converted to a two-dimensional one and the hardware overhead have been reduced, significantly due to eliminating the large number of multiplications in the original astrocyte model. Simulation results in MATLAB demonstrate that our method can mimic the original calcium waves in high degree of similarity. To validate our method in case of hardware, the proposed model has been tested and simulated in Modelsim software and also implemented on Spartan3 XC3S50 (TQ144) FPGA board. Hardware realization results show that the proposed model has high similarity by the simulation outputs. Consequently, this reduced-model of astrocyte can be used in large-scale networks because of its low-cost hardware and high-speed system. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper fractional Hindmarsh Rose (HR) neuron, which mimics several behaviors of a real biological neuron is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA). The results show several differences in the dynamic characteristics of integer and fractional order Hindmarsh Rose neuron models. The integer order model shows only one type of firing characteristics when the parameters of model remains same. The fractional order model depicts several dynamical behaviors even for the same parameters as the order of the fractional operator is varied. The firing frequency increases when the order of the fractional operator decreases. The fractional order is therefore key in determining the firing characteristics of biological neurons. To implement this neuron model first the digital realization of different fractional operator approximations are obtained, then the fractional integrator is used to obtain the low power and low cost hardware realization of fractional HR neuron. The fractional neuron model has been implemented on a low voltage and low power circuit and then compared with its integer counter part. The hardware is used to demonstrate the different dynamical behaviors of fractional HR neuron for different type of approximations obtained for fractional operator in this paper. A coupled network of fractional order HR neurons is also implemented. The results also show that synchronization between neurons increases as long as coupling factor keeps on increasing. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The necessity of predicting the spatio-temporal phenomenon of ionospheric variability is closely related to the requirement of many users to be able to obtain high accuracy positioning with low cost equipment. The Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique is highly accepted by the scientific community as a means for providing high level of position accuracy from a single receiver. However, its main drawback is the long convergence time to achieve centimeter-level accuracy in positioning. Hereby, we propose a deep learning-based approach for ionospheric modeling. This method exploits the advantages of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for timeseries modeling and predicts the total electron content per satellite from a specific station by making use of a causal, supervised deep learning method. The scope of the proposed method is to compare and evaluate the between-satellites ionospheric delay estimation, and to aggregate the Total Electron Content (TEC) outcomes per-satellite into a single solution over the station, thus constructing regional TEC models, in an attempt to replace Global Ionospheric Maps (GIM) data. The evaluation of our proposed recurrent method for the prediction of vertical total electron content (VTEC) values is compared against the traditional Autoregressive (AR) and the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) methods, per satellite. The proposed model achieves error lower than 1.5 TECU which is slightly better than the accuracy of the current GIM products which is currently about 2.0-3.0 TECU. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs) such as Apple's Siri, Google Now, and Amazon Alexa are becoming an increasingly important class of web application. In contrast to previous keyword-oriented search applications, IPAs support a rich query interface that allows user interaction through images, audio, and natural language queries. However, modern IPAs rely heavily on compute-intensive machine-learning inference. To achieve acceptable performance, ML-driven IPAs increasingly depend on specialized hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs, FPGAs or TPUs), increasing costs for IPA service providers. For end-users, IPAs also present considerable privacy risks given the sensitive nature of the data they capture. We present PAIGE, a hybrid edge-cloud architecture for privacy-preserving Intelligent Personal Assistants. PAIGE's design is founded on the assumption that recent advances in low-cost hardware for machine-learning inference offer an opportunity to offload compute-intensive IPA ML tasks to the network edge. To allow privacy-preserving access to large IPA databases for less compute-intensive pre-processed queries, PAIGE leverages trusted execution environments at the server side. PAIGE's hybrid design allows privacy-preserving hardware acceleration of compute-intensive tasks, while avoiding the need to move potentially large IPA question-answering databases to the edge. As a step towards realising PAIGE, we present a first systematic performance evaluation of existing edge accelerator hardware platforms for a subset of IPA workloads, and show they offer a competitive alternative to existing data-center alternatives. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Metalloporphyrins are molecules capable of optically sensing targets due to their specific reactivity, and mesoporous photonic architectures can act as environment-responsive materials. In this work, we used a metalloporphyrin, MnIII meso-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (MP), to add a recognition functionality to a mesoporous oxide photonic crystal (MOPC) in order to develop a versatile and portable sensing device for volatile amines exploiting both the open MOPC pore network and the high affinity of volatile amino analytes to the MP. The hybrid material MP@MOPC was prepared by immersion of the MOPC, synthesized from mesoporous silica and titania layers, in an MP solution. The system was characterized by UV–vis absorption and FTIR spectroscopies, and SEM microscopy. Sensing of small molecules was tested using ethylenediamine (EDA) as a volatile amine model, showing an absorbance increase in the MOPC spectral window with promising analytical parameters. The hybrid material presents enhanced sensing capabilities compared to the MP or MOPC components alone. A prototype device was built, aiming for a future design of simple, low-cost equipment, with a light emitting diode and a light-dependent resistor, which includes the MP@MOPC sensor. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this work, the generation and posterior chemometric resolution of third-order data, obtained from samples processed by liquid chromatography (LC) with online registering of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEM) is reported. Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyte (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Low-cost spectroscopy is one such application and mobile phone camera-based instruments have been used in pollution monitoring, medical applications in developing countries and vegetation analysis. Can such an instrument be developed and tested to assist with automated detection of materials, possibly from space? We tested two spectrometer designs inside a two unit (2U) cubesat frame against a series of materials exhibiting phenomenology in the visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) portion of the spectrum and vegetation groups. This was conducted in order to determine whether open source designs were capable of discriminating against similar materials, such as types of vegetation or types of iron-rich minerals. A spectral pipeline was created using open source programming software that was capable of converting raw sensor data into spectra, comparing samples of interest against a spectral library and returning an identification result with a confidence interval. We found that low-cost hardware sensitive to NIR and freely available software were able to identify types of materials in the study set, enabling applications in citizen science, education and outreach or even low-cost near-space research. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Synthetic biology emerged in the USA and Europe twenty years ago and quickly developed innovative research and technology as a result of continued funding. Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011–2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early “MIT school” of synthetic biology. In 2013–2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may be relevant to other developing countries. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Imaging underwater can be particularly problematic and expensive given the harsh environmental conditions posed by salinity and for some deployments, pressure. To counter these difficulties, expensive waterproof pressure resistant housings are often used, commonly built from expensive materials such as titanium, if intended for long duration deployments. Further, environmental investigations often benefit from replicate data collection, which additionally increases study costs. In this paper we present a new camera system, developed with off the shelf and 3D printed cost effective components for use in shallow waters of <150 m depth. Integrating Raspberry Pi Zero W microcomputers with open source design files and software, it is hoped these camera systems will be of interest to the global marine and freshwater research communities. © 2020},

The generator is especially designed for low-cost hardware implementation, although the software version is also considered. For this reason, Linear Feedback Shift Registers in conjunction with cyclic rotations are employed. The proposal presents a low implementation cost and overcomes the limitations of the previous Gaussian generators based on linear feedback shift registers by means of a less complex algorithm to find optimal configurations. As a consequence, it turns into a really usable generator. Moreover, a further improvement, based on the simulated annealing algorithm, is applied in order for the random values to be better adjusted to the normal distribution. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={An open-source precision pressure pump system and control software is presented, primarily designed for the experimental microfluidics community, although others may find additional uses for this precision pressure source. This mechatronic system is coined ‘µPump,’ and its performance rivals that of commercially available systems, at a fraction of the cost. The pressure accuracy, stability, and resolution are 0.09%, 0.02%, and 0.02% of the full span, respectively. The settling time to reach 2 bar from zero and stabilize is less than 2 s. Material for building a four-channel µPump (approx. $3000 USD) or an eight-channel µPump (approx. $5000 USD) is approximately a quarter, or a third of the cost of buying a high-end commercial system, respectively. The design rationale is presented, together with documented design details and software, so that the system may be replicated or customized to particular applications. µPump can be used for two-phase droplet microfluidics, single-phase microfluidics, gaseous flow microfluidics and any other applications requiring precise fluid handling. µPump provides researchers, students, and startups with a cost-effective solution for precise fluid control. © 2020},

abstract={Hyperspectral Imaging Sensors (HSI) obtain spectral information from an object, and they are used to solve problems in Remote Sensing, Food Analysis, Precision Agriculture, and others. This paper took advantage of modern high-resolution cameras, electronics, and optics to develop a robust, low-cost, and easy to assemble HSI device. This device could be used to evaluate new algorithms for hyperspectral image analysis and explore its feasibility to develop new applications on a low-budget. It weighs up to 300 g, detects wavelengths from 400 nm–1052 nm, and generates up to 315 different wavebands with a spectral resolution up to 2.0698 nm. Its spatial resolution of 116 × 110 pixels works for many applications. Furthermore, with only 2% of the cost of commercial HSI devices with similar characteristics, it has shown high spectral accuracy in controlled light conditions as well as ambient light conditions. Unlike related works, the proposed HSI system includes a framework to build the proposed HSI from scratch. This framework decreases the complexity of building an HSI device as well as the processing time. It contains every needed 3D model, a calibration method, the image acquisition software, and the methodology to build and calibrate the proposed HSI device. Therefore, the proposed HSI system is portable, reusable, and lightweight. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We have recently proposed approximate median filters (APMFs). They are based on the sorting network and achieve acceptable image quality under low-cost hardware. In this brief, we develop a specific comparator to improve the capabilities of those filters in noise elimination. The architecture of our inexact median filters (IMFs) is regular and modular. Also, we introduce the histogram-based error dispersion plot as a new error evaluation method to have a better assessment of IMF performance. Simulation results show that the proposed filter is effectively low cost in power, area, and speed. Despite the tradeoff between the filtering accuracy and circuit characteristics, the output quality of the filter is largely similar to that of the precise one. Also, the degradation is almost not noticeable to the human eye. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

VR-based applications were considered more effective helper for individual physical treatment because of their low-cost equipment and flexibility in time and space, less assistance of a physical therapist. A challenge in developing a VR-based physical treatment was understanding the body part movement accurately and quickly. We proposed a robust pipeline to understanding hand motion accurately. We retrieved our data from movement sensors such as HTC vive and leap motion. Given a sequence position of palm, we represent our data as binary 2D images of gesture shape. Our dataset consisted of 14 kinds of hand gestures recommended by a physiotherapist. Given 33 3D points that were mapped into binary images as input, we trained our proposed density-based CNN. Our CNN model concerned with our input characteristics, having many 'blank block pixels', 'single-pixel thickness' shape and generated as a binary image. Pyramid kernel size applied on the feature extraction part and classification layer using softmax as loss function, have given 97.7% accuracy. © 2020 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.},

abstract={The performance assessment of operating photovoltaic modules under real conditions is a necessity. Engineers usually use commercial I-V curve tracers available in the market. Nevertheless, most of them are expensive and limited in the input voltage. This paper outlines a low-cost equipment for tracing current-voltage characteristics of photovoltaic systems using a relay to connect the operating module under test to the varying load, which is a power MOSFET transistor. The new developments of this work include the design of an RC circuit to generate a steady gate-source voltage amplitude controlled via a PWM varying duty cycle. Also, a flexible modular voltage measurement that consists of a voltage booster to increase the input voltage capacity of the developed curve tracer is proposed. This paper investigated the impact of PV module degradations such as discoloration, cell cracks, and PID on the I-V curve in the case of crystalline technology and compared to similar modules taken as reference. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The monitoring of water ecosystems requires consistent and accurate sensor measurements, usually provided from traditional in-situ environmental monitoring systems. Such infrastructure, however, is expensive, hard to maintain and available only in limited areas that had been affected by extreme phenomena and require continuous monitoring. Due to climate change, the monitoring of larger areas and extended water ecosystems is imperative, raising the question of whether this monitoring can be disengaged from the in-situ monitoring systems. Due to climate change and extreme weather phenomena, more citizens are affected by environmental issues and become aware of the need to contribute to their monitoring. As a result, they are willing to offer their time to support the collection of scientific data. Collecting such data from volunteers, with no technical knowledge and while using low-cost equipment such as smart phones and portable sensors, raises the question of data quality and consistency. We present here a novel integrated toolbox that can support the organization of crowd-sourcing activities, ensure the engagement of the participants, the data collection in a consistent way, enforce extensive data quality controls and provide to local authorities and scientists access to the collected information in a uniform way, through widely accepted standards. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.

abstract={In our modern world, many Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are being researched and developed. IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km2) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Low-cost sensor navigation is growing in demand for next-generation, mass-market applications such as low-cost automation, smartphones, UAVs and others. Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurement processing technique in which wide-area-based satellite corrections are applied without the need for local infrastructure to attain kinematic accuracies at the dm- to cm-level. The most significant advantage of the PPP technique is that it does not require a local reference station for GNSS error calibration. GNSS PPP and inertial measurement unit (IMU) integration work is a relatively recent advancement in the area of precision navigation. In the past, high-precision GNSS receivers augmented with PPP processing were integrated with highperformance micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) IMUs. Later, single-frequency (SF) GNSS PPP + MEMS IMUs were explored. Recently, there has been the emergence of mass-market, low-cost, dual-frequency (DF) GNSS receivers. Integrating a low-cost DF GNSS receiver with low-cost MEMS IMU performs with decimetre-level accuracy even in an obstructed environment when there are only three or four satellites available. In this research work, the performance of tightly-coupled DF GNSS PPP and MEMS IMU is assessed when constraints are applied. Past research work in this area that examined constraining in detail did not involve PPP augmentation and the work that involved PPP augmentation does not explain and quantify impact constraining makes on the accuracy or continuity of the estimation/solution explicitly. In this work, vehicle constraints including zero velocity update (ZVU), zero angular rate update (ZARU), and height constraining are applied to assess any improvements they offer to the solution when GNSS-PPP is integrated with a low-cost MEMS IMU. Calibrating an IMU in a timely manner is required because of the nature of an IMU to drift with time in the absence of GNSS signals for calibration. When ZVU, ZARU, and height constraints are applied, the algorithm performs at the decimetre-level accuracy, as opposed to metre level accuracy with no constraining using the low-cost hardware during a partial GNSS signal outage. The research contribution through this work is the quantitative analysis of benefits attained from a unique combination of low-cost DF GNSS PPP and IMU integrated algorithm with dynamic constraints, which has not been analysed/quantified in previous works. The constraints make a significant positive impact on the algorithm in the absence of GNSS signals by improving the position and velocity solution by 85-90%. Next-generation applications such as low-cost robotics, low-cost autonomous vehicles, etc. that demand decimetre-level accuracy continuously can be potentially satisfied by a DF GNSS PPP + MEMS IMU solution once constraining is imposed. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Two electroactive polyoxometalates (POMs)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) films (POMOFs) in situ grown on carbon cloth (NENU-3/CC and NENU-5/CC) were synthesized by a facile one-step solvothermal method containing Cu(NO3)2, 1,3,5-benzentricarboxylate (H3BTC) and POMs (PMo12 and PW12), in which the POMs were wrapped into MOFs to increase stability. The analysis of electrochemical behavior of the NENU-3/CC and NENU-5/CC films reveals that they can serve as conductive electrode materials. Subsequently, two kinds of film electrodes exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward bromate reduction in acidic solution. Thus, they can act as electrochemical sensors to detect bromate. Amperometric detection results of NENU-3/CC to bromate show a high sensitivity of 45.11 μA cm −2 mM−1 and a low detection limit of 0.55 μM. Furthermore, NENU-5/CC can exhibit a detection limit of 1.18 μM, and a high sensitivity of 18.83 μA cm−2 mM−1. Experimental results show that two POMOFs films have high electrochemical stability as working electrode materials and good selectivity for detecting bromate as sensor materials. Novelty statement: Up to now, electrochemical methods to detect bromated have attracted considerable attention due to their simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity and environmentally friendliness with low-cost equipment compared with other techniques. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been widely used for the electrocatalytic reduction of bromate because of their high redox properties. However, when POMs are used as conductive electrodes materials, they dissolve easily in the electrolyte, and the instability of POMs can increase performance degradation. For solving the above-mentioned problem, POMs are encapsulated into MOFs to generate POM-based MOFs (POMOFs), it combine the merits of POMs and MOFs and increase the stability of skeleton. However, POMOFs materials can increase the reversible electrochemical capacity, the leaching and dispersity of POMOFs in the electrocatalytic measurement can make them unstable, and it hinders the conductivity in electrochemical behaviors. Thus, Proper POMOFs films have been developed to overcome the aforementioned difficulties by packing POMOFs on the conductive substrates uniformly to increase the stability and performance in electrochemical catalysis. In this paper, two electroactive polyoxometalates (POMs)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) films (NENU-3 and NENU-5) were chosen as target materials in the synthesis of POMOFs film. And they were located on the surface of the carbon cloth through a facile in situ one-step solvothermal method as conductive electrode materials. According to report, NENU-3 and NENU-5 were coated on the substrate using hot-pressing and electrochemical method, we firstly prepared NENU-3/CC and NENU-5/CC films by in situ one-step solvothermal method, and the as-synthesized POMOFs materials using this method are more uniform, facile, and stable than other methods. The results of amperometric detection of NENU-3/CC to bromate show a wide linear range of 5–560 μM with a high sensitivity of 45.11 μA cm−2 mM−1 and a low detection limit of 0.55 μM. Furthermore, NENU-5/CC can exhibit a good linearity range of 15–380 μM, a detection limit of 1.18 μM, and a high sensitivity of 18.83 μA cm−2 mM−1. As a result, the amperometric determination demonstrates that two as-synthesized POMOFs/CC films as working electrode materials exhibit good sensitivity, selectivity, and stability to detect bromate as sensor materials. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Heterogeneous architectures and heterogeneous-ISA designs are growing areas of computer architecture and system software research. Unfortunately, this line of research is significantly hindered by the lack of experimental systems and modifiable hardware frameworks. This work proposes BYOC, a "Bring Your Own Core" framework that is specifically designed to enable heterogeneous-ISA and heterogeneous system research. BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system. BYOC is well suited to be the premiere platform for heterogeneous-ISA architecture, system software, and compiler research. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={The design of markerless systems to reconstruct human motion in a timely, unobtrusive and externally valid manner is still an open challenge. Artificial intelligence algorithms based on automatic landmarks identification on video images opened to a new approach, potentially e-viable with low-cost hardware. OpenPose is a library that t using a two-branch convolutional neural network allows for the recognition of skeletons in the scene. Although OpenPose-based solutions are spreading, their metrological performances relative to video setup are still largely unexplored. This paper aimed at validating a two-cameras OpenPose-based markerless system for gait analysis, considering its accuracy relative to three factors: cameras' relative distance, gait direction and video resolution. Two volunteers performed a walking test within a gait analysis laboratory. A marker-based optical motion capture system was taken as a reference. Procedures involved: calibration of the stereoscopic system; acquisition of video recordings, simultaneously with the reference marker-based system; video processing within OpenPose to extract the subject's skeleton; videos synchronization; triangulation of the skeletons in the two videos to obtain the 3D coordinates of the joints. Two set of parameters were considered for the accuracy assessment: errors in trajectory reconstruction and error in selected gait space-temporal parameters (step length, swing and stance time). The lowest error in trajectories (~20 mm) was obtained with cameras 1.8 m apart, highest resolution and straight gait, and the highest (~60 mm) with the 1.0 m, low resolution and diagonal gait configuration. The OpenPose-based system tended to underestimate step length of about 1.5 cm, while no systematic biases were found for swing/stance time. Step length significantly changed according to gait direction (p = 0.008), camera distance (p = 0.020), and resolution (p < 0.001). Among stance and swing times, the lowest errors (0.02 and 0.05 s for stance and swing, respectively) were obtained with the 1 m, highest resolution and straight gait configuration. These findings confirm the feasibility of tracking kinematics and gait parameters of a single subject in a 3D space using two low-cost webcams and the OpenPose engine. In particular, the maximization of cameras distance and video resolution enabled to achieve the highest metrological performances. © Copyright © 2020 Zago, Luzzago, Marangoni, De Cecco, Tarabini and Galli.},

abstract={Background: Reach-grasp movements are motor components commonly affected after stroke and directly related to the independence of these individuals. Evaluations of these activities can be performed using clinical instruments and assessed by detailed and costly kinematic analyses. The aim of this study was to develop an analysis of reach-grasp movements in post-stroke patients using a simple, inexpensive, and manageable instrument. Results: A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare paretic and non-paretic limb motor performance. A statistically significant difference was found between the variables of total time (p = 0.02) and speed to reach target 3 (p = 0.04) for task 1, while in task 2 significance was found only in the aspect of speed to reach target 2 (p = 0.04). The correlation between clinical tests and variables of tasks was then performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. At task 1, when compared with the REACH instrument, the close target sub-item; there was a high positive correlation between the parameters of total time (p = 0.028), target velocity 3 (p = 0.028), and target acceleration 3 (p = 0.028). Another instrument that showed a high positive correlation with the target time 3 (p = 0.01) and target acceleration 3 (p = 0.028) variables was the Box and Block Test. When correlated, the data between the task 2 variables and clinical instruments did not present statistically significant data. Conclusion: Our instrument - the Temporal Data Acquisition Instrument - TDAI - fulfilled the expected objectives and can be used as an option to evaluate the movements of reach and grasp of upper limb post-stroke, using an easy and fast application, without the need for calibration.

abstract={Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a key technique for autonomous navigation of a robot in unknown environments. Recently, many researchers focus on the algorithm optimization of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) as a real-Time SLAM method. In this paper, different from pure algorithm research, we propose a novel low-cost hardware solution based on the system on a chip (SoC) to achieve real-Time performance and low power consumption of VIO. We design a novel hardware architecture to accelerate a popular VIO algorithm, with the time-costly image feature processing computed on FPGA and floating-point numerical computation been done on ARM. On the algorithm side, we fuse odometry information from the two wheels of the ground robot in a unified optimization method, which results in accurate metric scale estimation of the VIO. The experimental results show that our design and implementation have superior performance for ground robot applications, allowing real-Time localization of a robot with a very low-cost hardware for computation in complex environments. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF educational robot manipulator with a gripper. The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments presented in the paper. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The attitude control using reaction wheels as actuators has been one of the most popular ways to stabilize and repel external disturbances in aerospace devices. From the controlled change of the angular momentum rate of change using reaction wheels, it is possible to control the oscillation and direction rates of change of rigid bodies in space. Thus, the main idea of this article is to present a case study with different configurations of the well-known reaction wheel pendulum. The first is based on the classical configuration, and the second, a new one, a pendulum with two reaction wheels. For both configurations, proportional–integral–derivative controllers were designed and experimental devices were built to perform real-time controllers using low-cost hardware. The simulated and experimental results have shown that the pendulums were controlled using a simple controller in the inverted position and the results were satisfactory. Four performance indices were calculated to evaluate the results for each configuration. They showed that the pendulum with two reaction wheels worked better than the pendulum with one reaction wheel. Two actuators made it easier to move and control the pendulum in the inverted position. © IMechE 2019.},

abstract={Tissue decellularization for generating extracellular matrices has become a staple of regenerative medicine in the recent decades, extending from the research setting to clinical usage. Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Abstract: An open-source syringe pump has been developed for use in the analytical laboratory. Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1%, and the random one was less than 3 μL.

abstract={Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Accurate building energy assessments are often limited by inaccurate assumptions about the buildings' properties and occupant behavior. Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Watching sports events via 3D-instead of two-dimensional video streaming allows for increased immersion, e.g. via mixed reality headsets in comparison to traditional screens. So far, capturing 3D video of sports events required expensive outside-in tracking with numerous cameras. This study demonstrates the feasibility of streaming sports content to mixed reality headsets as holographs in real-time using inside-out tracking and low-cost equipment only. We demonstrate our system by streaming a race car on an indoor track as 3D models, which are then rendered in an Magic Leap One headset. An onboard camera, mounted on the race car provides the video stream used to localize the car via computer vision. The localization is estimated by an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN). The study compares three state-of-the-art CNN models in their respective accuracy and execution time, with PoseNet + LSTM achieving position and orientation accuracy of 0.35m and 3.95°. The total streaming latency in this study was 1041ms, suggesting technical feasibility of streaming 3D sports content, e.g. on large playgrounds, in near real-time onto mixed-reality headsets. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Animal welfare is a major concern these days, as well as the factors that have impact on animal productivity. Constant monitoring of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, levels of ammonia and luminosity is crucial because these variables directly impact poultry performance and welfare. Along these lines, it is necessary to look for solutions that allow the monitoring of these variables in a practical, reliable and cheap way. In the agribusiness, the scenario for the IoT (Internet of Things) is very promising, because it has emerged to fill this gap and deliver sensed data, widely increasing the connectivity of the devices. Therefore, this paper describes a low cost, hardware and software proposal for monitoring these environmental parameters in poultry farms. In addition, experiments were done to compare the proposed prototype with commercial devices. The measured variables showed a correlation above 0.90 between the sensors used in the prototype and the calibrated equipment, also having the cost of only 13% of that of the conventional equipment. The prototype displayed favorable results, indicating that its implementation is viable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Conventional track circuit condition monitoring systems are fixed at the wayside, with each installation reporting on a single track circuit. In this work, we present a custom-built, sensitive, magnetic field detection system, which can be fitted to the underside of a rail vehicle. With this system installed, some characteristics of an operating track circuit can be monitored from the vehicle whilst it is in motion. By using appropriate analysis techniques, it is possible to identify the signatures of equipment relating to audio frequency track circuits, the topic of this work. Analysing the signatures of track circuit equipment demonstrated that there were clear differences between track circuit assets. By building on other research into the behaviours of failing track circuits, and continuing to conduct this research, the authors believe that it is possible, and beneficial, to perform condition monitoring of track circuits from low-cost equipment mounted on the train. Coupling this with advanced analysis techniques will allow predictive maintenance of track circuits with very little capital outlay. © IMechE 2018.},

abstract={With the global electricity demand witnessing a 3.1 percent jump in 2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Modeling and implementation of biological neurons are key to the fundamental understanding of neural network architectures in the brain and its cognitive behavior. Synchronization of neuronal models play a significant role in neural signal processing as it is very difficult to identify the actual interaction between neurons in living brain. Therefore, the synchronization study of these neuronal architectures has received extensive attention from researchers. Higher biological accuracy of these neuronal units demands more computational overhead and requires more hardware resources for implementation. This paper presents a two coupled hardware implementation of Hindmarsh Rose neuron model which is mathematically simpler model and yet mimics several behaviors of a real biological neuron. These neurons are synchronized using an exponential function. The coupled system shows several behaviors depending upon the parameters of HR model and coupling function. An approximation of coupling function is also provided to reduce the hardware cost. Both simulations and a low cost hardware implementations of exponential synaptic coupling function and its approximation are carried out for comparison. Hardware implementation on field programmable gate array (FPGA) of approximated coupling function shows that the coupled network produces different dynamical behaviors with acceptable error. Hardware implementation shows that the approximated coupling function has significantly lower implementation cost. A spiking neural network based on HR neuron is also shown as a practical application of this coupled HR neural networks. The spiking network successfully encodes and decodes a time varying input. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With technologies rapidly evolving, many research institutions are now opting to invest in costly, high-quality, specialized microscopes which are shared by many researchers. As a consequence, the user may not have the ability to adapt a microscope to their specific needs and limitations in experimental design are introduced. A flexible work-horse microscopy system is a valuable tool in any laboratory to meet the diverse needs of a research team and promote innovation in experimental design. We have developed the Flexiscope; a multi-functional, adaptable, efficient and high-performance microscopy/electrophysiology system for everyday applications in a neurobiology laboratory. The core optical components are relatively constant in the three configurations described here: an upright configuration, an inverted configuration and an upright/electrophysiology configuration. We have provided a comprehensive description of the Flexiscope. We show that this method is capable of oblique infrared illumination imaging, multi-channel fluorescent imaging and automated three-dimensional scanning of larger specimens. Image quality is conserved across the three configurations of the microscope, and conversion between configurations is possible quickly and easily, while the motion control system can be repurposed to allow sub-micrometre computer-controlled micromanipulation. The Flexiscope provides similar performance and usability to commercially available systems. However, as it can be easily reconfigured for multiple roles, it can remove the need to purchase multiple microscopes, giving significant cost savings. The modular reconfigurable nature allows the user to customize the system to their specific needs and adapt/upgrade the system as challenges arise, without requiring specialized technical skills. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Traveling wave reflection method is widely used in cable length measurement and fault location. How to effectively remove noise interference and accurately identify the starting point of pulse reflection is the key problem to be solved by this method. In this paper, two new methods, the improved weighted coefficient method based on the wavelet theory and the curve fitting method, are proposed for different identification accuracy and velocity by analyzing the measured reflected wave signal. The improved weighted coefficient method was used to process the traditional denoising threshold with the same value of ± thr, and then the calculated weighted threshold was used to reduce the noise of the measured signal, so as to highlight and identify the starting point of reflection pulse. The curve fitting method is adopted to compare the reflected wave anomaly with the threshold value of the corresponding length cable. If the threshold value is exceeded, the fault reflection can be judged as fault reflection. Then the quadratic function fitting is carried out here, and the starting point of the reflected pulse is directly determined by using the intersection point of the quadratic curve and the reference voltage. The experimental and simulation results show that the improved weighted coefficient method solves the problems of unsmoothness of denoising and discontinuity of derivative of denoising function, improves the accuracy of identifying the starting point of reflection wave, provides a new algorithm for improving the measurement accuracy. The curve fitting method has high speed, low demand for hardware, and the error can be controlled within 10ns, which is more suitable for low-cost equipment based on Microcontrollers. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.},

The method is implemented in a portable platform, reduced both in computing power and in RAM memory. The performance is evaluated using different eye tracking methods implemented by the authors on the same platform. For this purpose, a database generated on this hardware is used.

abstract={Increased penetration levels of renewable energy and other types of distributed energy resources (DERs) on the modern electric grid-combined with technological advancements for electric system monitoring and control-introduce new cyberattack vectors and increase the cyberattack surface of energy systems. According to the IEEE Std. 1547-2018, DERs must use Modbus, Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3), or Smart Energy Profile 2.0 (SEP2) as their communication protocol. Previous research identified several vulnerabilities and security breaches in each one of these communication protocols; despite this, existing standards for DERs do not recommend cybersecurity measures. In order to reduce vulnerabilities in power distribution systems, this paper presents a novel open-source hardware security module that improves both information and operational security to better protect data and communications on the distribution grid. The security hardware is called 'module for operational technology, ' or simply Module-OT, and it has been validated and tested in an emulated distribution system application. Module-OT is integrated within a communication system in the transport layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It improves system security through encryption, authentication, authorization, certificate management, and user access control. The main advancement of Module-OT is the addition of hardware cryptographic acceleration that improves the overall communication performance in terms of end-to-end latency. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With ever increasing DERs and the associated volatility, top-down and centralized architectures fail. Reliance on communication systems drastically drops the resiliency of the system and exposes the systems to single points of failure. Demand management and smart load scheduling is key to managing wide variations in supply-demand ratios. Smart home devices often react to real-time prices performing arbitrage, demand optimization and smart scheduling. However, these devices rely on pricing mechanisms that need heavy centralized computation and low-latency communication infrastructure. The resulting smart home devices become quite expensive and unable to work in remote locations without connectivity. This paper proposes a first true integration of a low-cost hardware platform capable of edge intelligence, full AMI functionality and a decentralized transactional architecture that allows real-time prices to be generated locally based on system frequency. The smart home energy devices work with intermittent connectivity, by using mobile ad-hoc networks. The proposed platform shows great potential for consumer savings while implementing a highly resilient and fractal architecture. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Two main bottlenecks encountered when implementing energy-efficient spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) based sparse coding, are the complex computation of winner-take-all (WTA) operation and repetitive neuronal operations in the time domain processing. In this article, we present an energy-efficient STDP based sparse coding processor. The low-cost hardware is based on the algorithmic reduction techniques as following: First, the complex WTA operation is simplified based on the prediction of spike emitting neurons. Sparsity based approximation in spatial and temporal domain are also efficiently exploited to remove the redundant neurons with negligible algorithmic accuracy loss. We designed and implemented the hardware of the STDP based sparse coding using 65nm CMOS process. By exploiting input sparsity, the proposed SNN architecture can dynamically trade off algorithmic quality for computation energy (up to 74%) for Natural image (maximum 0.01 RMSE increment) and MNIST (no accuracy loss) applications. In the inference mode of operations, the SNN hardware achieves the throughput of 374 Mpixels/s and 840.2 GSOP/s with the energy-efficiency of 781.52 pJ/pixel and 0.35 pJ/SOP. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The five-level nested neutral-point-pilot (NPP) topology, as a new structure for converters, bears the advantages of a high power density, robustness, and flexibility and is therefore suitable for high-voltage and high-power applications. For a multilevel converter, as the number of power electronic switches increases, the risk of switch failure increases, together with the complexity of fault detection and tolerance control. The requirements for a higher operational stability and reliability continue to grow. However, studies on fault tolerance for multilevel converters are limited. In this paper, a fault diagnosis and tolerance solution for a five-level nested NPP converter is proposed. For the fault diagnosis, a deep learning method integrating the wavelet packet transform and long short-term memory is presented. Both open- and short-circuit switch failures can be precisely detected and located without the requirement of a large sample set. Two software-based control strategies for fault tolerance are adopted, and low-cost hardware reconfigurations are also implemented to prevent failure expansion and ensure continuous operation. Furthermore, the voltages of dc-link capacitors and flying capacitors are effectively balanced with the improved algorithm even when a failure occurs. Finally, the effectiveness of the fault-tolerant strategy are proven by simulations and experiments. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Here, pulsed plasma nitriding of AISI-316L austenite stainless steel is conducted in a narrow range of temperature 510-550 °C and simultaneous combination of expanded austenite phase, and homogenous, dense chromium nitride phase is attained in a single processing unit, with relative low-cost equipment and single-step processing. The results show a noteworthy enhancement in nanohardness at 530 °C, whereas best wear resistance is achieved by processing at 550 °C. A dual-layer structure is obtained constituted of expanded austenite phase covered by quite homogenous chromium nitride phase, which is probably responsible for the dramatic surface improvement. The wear mechanism is changed after plasma processing (abrasive to adhesive wear), and the friction coefficient is reduced and smoother, particularly for the sample treated at 530 °C. Interestingly, the corrosion resistance is also found to be enhanced, even in the presence of chromium nitride (which usually deteriorate the corrosion resistance), which is probably credited to the formation of fine-grained and homogeneous CrN layer over the expanded austenite phase. This study suggests that the development of homogenous CrN layer over the expanded austenite structure is highly valuable for mechanical and tribological features, and it enhances the corrosion resistance. © 2020, ASM International.},

abstract={The micro-turbojet engine (MTE) is especially suitable for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Because the rotor speed is proportional to the thrust force, the accurate speed tracking control is indispensable for MTE. Thanks to its simplicity, the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is commonly used for rotor speed regulation. However, the PID controller cannot guarantee superior performance over the entire operation range due to the time-variance and strong nonlinearity of MTE. The gain scheduling approach using a family of linear controllers is recognized as an efficient alternative, but such a solution heavily relies on the model sets and pre-knowledge. To tackle such challenges, a single neural adaptive PID (SNA-PID) controller is proposed herein for rotor speed control. The new controller featuring with a single-neuron network is able to adaptively tune the gains (weights) online. The simple structure of the controller reduces the computational load and facilitates the algorithm implementation on low-cost hardware. Finally, the proposed controller is validated by numerical simulations and experiments on the MTE in laboratory conditions, and the results show that the proposed controller achieves remarkable effectiveness for speed tracking control. In comparison with the PID controller, the proposed controller yields 54% and 66% reductions on static tracking error under two typical cases. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose cost-effective, open hardware-based smart meter monitoring and controlling system to monitor and control individual consumer using Internet of Things (IoT). We developed a smart meter based on a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, which helps to continuously monitor the individual consumer’s consumption and to log the use at server using publish-subscribe architecture. The proposed smart meter is capable of controlling the supply to the consumer based on the commands from the server with an additional feature of meter tamper detection. To monitor consumption and billing information of the consumer, an android application was developed. The prototype of the proposed system is built using open-source hardware components, and various test conditions are applied to validate the proposed method of approach. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={The internet of things is rapidly becoming a fact of life. There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={RTL simulation is a critical tool for hardware design but its current slow speed often bottlenecks the whole design process. Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this work, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers. IEEE},

Last decade, different initiatives were born that promulgate the use of these technologies for the design and construction of low-cost devices. Two of these initiatives, Arduino project and Raspberry Pi project, could be used for the design of sensors, loggers, and machines useful for a rock mechanics laboratory. Two examples of these technologies are a very low-cost strain-gauge logger and a control mechanism for a tilt test machine. These two devices have been designed, manufactured, and tested.

Blinkies are made up of a central processing unit connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure. Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment. Finally, we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual Blinkies in highly reverberent environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a fast-processing and low-cost hardware multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel emulator. The channel emulator is an important component of hardware-based simulation systems. The novelty of this work is the use of sharing and pipelining functions to reduce hardware resource utilization while maintaining a high sample rate. In our proposed emulator, the samples are created sequentially and interpolated to ensure the sample rate is equal to the base band rate. The proposed 4 × 4 MIMO requires low-cost hardware resource so that it can be implemented on a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. An implementation on Xilinx Virtex-7 VX980T was found to occupy 10.47% of the available configurable slice registers and 12.58% of the FPGA's slice lookup tables. The maximum frequency of the proposed emulator is 758.064 MHz, so up to 560 different paths can be processed simultaneously to generate 560 × 758 million × 2 × 32 bit complex-valued fading samples per second. © 2020 The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering.},

abstract={Open-source designs are being increasingly used to develop robot hardware. When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent advancements in whole slide imaging (WSI) have moved pathology closer to digital practice. Existing systems require precise mechanical control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists. Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI. The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of ∼0.7 μm. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm2 region in ∼2 mins with throughput comparable to existing high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly available and utilizable without loss of capacity. © 2019 Optical Society of America.},

To connect all the necessary equipment, a connection board was constructed, and some additional hardware was acquired for the system to be able to perform all the necessary tasks. The whole controlling system was also put in a small enclosure to make it portable. The control-system software was written in C++ using the Pigpio library. The developed system was then tested, and the results were compared to a commercially available Instron 8802 device. A comparison of the results shows that the upgraded equipment can produce comparable results to commercially available devices and is sufficiently accurate to be applied for research purposes for the characterization of soft tissues and other materials. © 2020 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

abstract={Implementation of deep learning in low-cost hardware, such as an edge device, is challenging. Reducing the complexity of the network is one of the solutions to reduce resource usage in the system, which is needed by low-cost system implementation. In this study, we use the general average pooling layer to replace the fully connected layers on the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, used in the previous study, to reduce the number of network properties without decreasing the model performance in developing image classification for image search tasks. We apply the cosine similarity to measure the characteristic similarity between the feature vector of image input and extracting feature vectors from testing images in the database. The result of the cosine similarity calculation will show the image as the result of the searching image task. In the implementation, we use Raspberry Pi 3 as a low-cost hardware and CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing images. Base on the development and implementation, the accuracy of the model is 68%, and the system generates the result of the image search base on the characteristic similarity of the images. © 2020 by the authors.

As a design concept, it is fundamental for monitoring and assessing his interaction with technological devices, such as imaging systems. A bad design can affect the mental workload of the operator, and therefore, becomes useful to assess it while performing the required tasks. This work presents a tool for cognitive workload assessment that is composed of two open-source and low-cost hardware parts: an electroencephalography system and an eye-tracker. Both are synchronized via an open-source software: Lab Streaming Layer. This paper describes the architecture of the sensor system, considering also specially developed hardware and software components that were included to allow the integration of the different subsystems. In order to show the performance of the system as tool to assess some psycho-physical indicators, examples of dedicated signal processing are also presented. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This book is about the Arduino microcontroller and the Arduino concept. The visionary Arduino team of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis launched a new innovation in microcontroller hardware in 2005, the concept of open-source hardware. Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. In June 2019, Joel Claypool and I met to plan the fourth edition of Arduino Microcontroller Processing for Everyone! Our goal has been to provide an accessible book on the rapidly changing world of Arduino for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To make the book more accessible to better serve our readers, we decided to change our approach and provide a series of smaller volumes. Each volume is written to a specific audience. This book, Arduino I: Getting Started is written for those looking for a quick tutorial on the Arduino environment, platforms, interface techniques, and applications. Arduino II will explore advanced techniques, applications, and systems design. Arduino III will explore Arduino applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). Arduino I: Getting Started covers three different Arduino products: the Arduino UNO R3 equipped with the Microchip ATmega328, the Arduino Mega 2560 equipped with the Microchip ATmega2560, and the wearable Arduino LilyPad. © 2020 by Morgan & Claypool.},

abstract={Nowadays, the world is experiencing many changes, the technology is conquered by open hardware movement and the competition is based mainly on the development of ground-breaking products. These technological and economical changes are pushing companies to reinvent themselves to develop products that are cheaper, better and of good quality than competitors. An appealing avenue for these companies is to use open hardware solutions in the development of their new products. However, product development processes used nowadays are not suited to exploit the full potential of open hardware. This work addresses this issue by first performing an in-depth assessment of the academic literature on product innovation processes and later proposing a product development process based on open technologies. The process introduces a new product development rationale that includes four phases: the first phase is looking for opportunities, which involves generating opportunities and creative ideas. The second phase is the opportunity assessment phase, which consists of selecting and capturing opportunities. The third phase is the validation of opportunities phase through technical feasibility, client desirability and sustainability. The fourth phase is engineering design, which includes concept generation, prototyping testing, and product manufacturing. The developed process hopes to open the way for businesses, especially in emerging countries like Morocco, to be competitive on the market by helping them designing superior products based on open technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of the world population over the past years, the agriculture industry is asked to respond properly to the exponential augmentation of global demand for food production. In the past few years, autonomous agricultural field machines have been gaining significant attention from farmers and industries in order to reduce costs, human workload, and required resources. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient autonomous navigation capabilities requires the simultaneous cooperation of different processes; localization, mapping, and path planning are just some of the steps that aim at providing to the machine the right set of skills to operate in semi-structured and unstructured environments. In this context, the presented research exploits later advancement in deep learning and edge computing technologies to provide a robust and fully integrable local planner for autonomous navigation along vineyards rows. Moreover, the devised and tested platform necessitates only of low range and low-cost hardware with minimal power and bandwidth requirements. The machine learning algorithm has been trained and tested with acquired images during different field surveys in the north region of Italy. Then, after performing an optimization process, the overall system has been validated with a customized robot platform in the appropriate environment. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The stethoscope is a major symbol of modern medicine. It is used for diagnosis of different conditions and enables physicians to listen to internal body sounds. Electrocardiography was only introduced in medicine in the beginning of the twentieth century. Today measuring heart’s electrical activity is also fundamental cardiac diseases diagnosis. Although performed with independent devices, requiring physician and patient presence in the same physical space, in combination they enhance cardiovascular assessment. In this paper, a digital stethoscope encapsulation was designed, adding new functionality to this advanced medical device. Today wired and wireless communications enable different medical devices to share data and information, over long distances. Using low-cost hardware technologies, the encapsulation will add the ability to acquire and transmit via Bluetooth the Electrocardiographic activity, determined in the same cardiac focus and synchronised with the Phonocardiographic sound recordings. Several encapsulation concepts were developed and prototyped using 3D printing. They were easily fitted to the digital stethoscope and tested in a hospital environment for ergonomics, acoustic and electric signals acquisition. The best concept was chosen with the help of a physician’s opinion and the final prototype performance was very satisfactory. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Reaction wheels have been extensively used to control and stabilize a wide range of applications due to the angular momentum exchange that they provide to mechanical systems. However, there exist several limitations associated with actuator saturation and the presence of singularities that lead towards the use of different controllers and devices. Recently, a new and unusual configuration using two reaction wheels was proposed and illustrated in an inverted pendulum to drive and control it using a simple and well-known PID controller. In this context, this paper improves the previous results on the same system by proposing two more sophisticated nonlinear controllers: a nonlinear proportional-derivative and a sliding mode controller. The proof of the stability of each controller is also provided, and the asymptotic stability is proven. A friction model is experimentally updated into the differential equations of the pendulum and also included for the controllers designing. A real-time application verifies the performance of the controllers using low-cost hardware. Results based on the analysis of different performance indices highlight the improvement of applying these two nonlinear control techniques comparing to the previous paper using this configuration of actuators. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Obstacle avoidance is an essential feature for autonomous robots. It is usually addressed with specialized sensors and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms (SLAM, Cadena et al. (2016)). Muller et al. (2006) have demonstrated that it can also be addressed using end-to-end deep learning. They proposed a convolutional neural network that maps raw stereo pair input images to steering outputs and is trained by a human driver in an outdoor setting. Using the ToyCollect open source hardware and software platform, we replicate their main findings, compare several variants of their network that differ in the way steering angles are represented, and extend their system to indoor obstacle avoidance. We discuss several issues for further work concerning the automated generation of training data and the quantitative evaluation of such systems. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL. Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences are suggested. © 2020 The Authors.},

abstract={Remote operation of gates is desirable for multiple purposes. For instance, in the case of flood control, the storage ponds (e.g., detention ponds, reservoirs, wetlands) are often located in remote areas. For draining storage ponds by gravity, siphons, and/or sloped pipes could be used. For shallow ponds (up to 6 meters of storage height), siphons and sloped pipes could be used while, as for deeper ponds, only sloped pipes could be used. Siphons only require anchoring, whereas sloped pipes would require a trench on the storage berm. This paper presents a low-cost hardware system for remote water release, which could be used for multiple purposes. In the case of flood control, remote operation could be used to release water hours or days before heavy rainfall events to increase the capacity of storage units (e.g., wetlands, reservoirs, detention ponds). The proposed system consists of a modular and integrated hardware/software platform that interfaces automated gates for siphons and sloped pipes, sensors, and communication for remote operation using a 3G/4G cellular network. The proposed system is powered using a battery, which is recharged by a solar panel. Multiple prototypes of the system (single and array) were built and extensively tested in our laboratory. This approach could open the doors for low-cost applications of remotely-operated water release to areas such as flood control, management of water levels in wetlands for ecological purposes, among others. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Many works in the literature show that positive emotions improve learning. However, in the educational context, the affective dimension is often not adopted in the teaching-learning process. One of them is that there are many students for a teacher, making the practice of adapting the didactics and individualized feedbacks practically impossible. The low or sometimes no emotion analysis of those involved in learning also becomes a obstacle. One possibility to circumvent this problem is the use of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), to understand the student individually and adapt environments according to their use. It also adds the theories of emotions so that the ITS can understand the affective dimension of the student during activities. This paper aims to present a way to infer changes in a student’s affective states to improve feedbacks in ITS For this, facial expressions and brain waves (using a low-cost equipment called openBCI) were studied for acquisition and emotions. In the initial tests, the methodology has met what was expected, however, more studies with experiments must be carried out. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={The electroluminescence (EL) test permits to obtain an image with active and inactive areas of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. The occurrence of inactive areas is mainly caused by mechanical impact in PV module along its live steps; those areas cause efficiency and energy losses. This work presents the EL lab implementation with low-cost equipment such as a digital camera Sony cyber-shot DSC-WX9. The procedure to adapt the camera to get images of wave length near of PV cells emission is described in details. A low-power voltage sources suitable configured to inject short current (Isc) values of PV modules was used. It was observed that, with this apparatus, the EL lab was properly implemented; it permitted to obtain pictures of EL PV cells emission with different PV module defects. A test with the relation ISO configurations vs percentage of Isc injected was performed. The ISO 800 configuration of camera permits visually to detect inactive areas of cells in PV modules with values of injected electrical current less than 50 % of Isc. This fact results in an even higher cost reduction with equipment. © 2019. The Authors.

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) band, or high frequencies such as THz, has large undeveloped band of spectrum. However, wireless channels over the mmWave band usually have one or two paths only due to the severe attenuation. The channel property restricts its development in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which can improve throughput by increasing the spectral efficiency. Recent development in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides new opportunities to mmWave communications. In this study, we propose a mmWave system, which used low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), with the aid of several RIS arrays. Moreover, each RIS array has many reflectors with discrete phase shift. By employing the linear spatial processing, these arrays form a synthetic channel with increased spatial diversity and power gain, which can support MIMO transmission. We develop a MIMO detector according to the characteristics of the synthetic channel. RIS arrays can provide spatial diversity to support MIMO transmission, however, different number, antenna configuration, and deployment of RIS arrays affect the bit error rate (BER) performance. We present state evolution (SE) equations to evaluate the BER of the proposed MIMO detector in the different cases. The BER performance of indoor system is studied extensively through leveraging by the SE equations. We reveal numerous insights about the RIS effects and discuss the appropriate system settings. In addition, our results demonstrate that the low-cost hardware, such as the 3-bit ADCs of the receiver side and the 2-bit uniform discrete phase shift of the RIS arrays, only moderately degenerate the system performance.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the effect that mental fatigue during repetitive exercises of a visual P300 Speller has on the P300 component, in terms of accuracy, amplitude, latency, signal morphology, and overall signal quality. This work is part of a larger EEG based project and is based on the P300 speller BCI (oddball) paradigm and the xDAWN algorithm, with eight healthy subjects; while using a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on low fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Herein, eight channels through the initial task (6 minutes), additional tasks (50 minutes) and final task (6 minutes) states, recorded the subjects’ signal. Our results show that the accuracy was best for the initial task (IT) at 100%, followed closely by the final task (FT) at 98%. In addition, our ANOVA analysis showed that the amplitude exhibited a statistical significance between IT and FT, while the latency did not indicate any statistical difference. This paper provides initial results into the practicability of the aforementioned P300 speller methodology and low-cost equipment to be used repetitively and continually and the effect thereof on accuracy and signal characteristics. Our aim is to assess the effect of prolonged usage and exposure to the aforementioned methodology and equipment, with the aim of broadening its use in a real-world context.

abstract={In grid-connected renewable systems, synchronization with the utility grid is the most important matter. Generally, the PLL is the most commonly adopted. This paper presents a performant analysis and comparison of the popular synchronization algorithms under grid normal and abnormal conditions based on several simulations in MATLAB software. It has been proved that the best output performance is resulted by the Dual Second Order Generalized Integrator PLL. This latter was developed and implemented to Arduino DUE as a low-cost real time implementation based on real hardware components. The setup provided in this work could make the operation of grid-connected renewable (particularly photovoltaic) systems practicable in terms of cost and good performance. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

As a contribution to the first steps of research in this discipline a clear definition for OSD is proposed and used to describe the key elements of a suggested OSD Process model. Several case studies are analysed to create an Archetypal Business Model characterising OSD of tangible products and the possibilities and delimitations within. Furthermore, strategic tools are suggested for companies that wish to explore the potentials OSD brings which form a so called OSD Method. The result of the method is the OSD Strategy and implementation thereof. This is done with the objective of determining the potential profitability that lies within OSD of tangible products and how companies can utilise this new approach to improve their business models and capture value in innovative ways. © 2012 NordDesign.All right reserved.},

abstract={A lot of communication protocols have been developed to support the efficient communication of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. These kinds of applications are intended to run with constrained resources. However, the selection of a standard and effective industrial messaging protocol is a challenging task for any shop floor integration because it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements. In this paper, two IoT protocols like Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are compared using a low-cost hardware device for factory integration. The results show that the CoAP protocol is designed to be so small that it fits inside a microcontroller, but it can be fully applied in cyber-physical environments, in another aspect the AMQP protocol is more complex, there is no official support and you need bigger installation packages; but it provides a higher communication speed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={NoSQL allows fast processing of real-time large data applications. It allows database professionals to make use of elastic scalability of database servers. Most of these databases are created to perform on full throttle despite the presence of low-cost hardware. Users are able to create the database more quickly due to the non-relational nature of NoSQL. There is no need of developing the detailed (fine-grained) database model. As a result, it will save lots of development time. The primary aim of this paper is to present a novel data integration method as well as workflow that executes the data integration of various source systems in such a way that user does not require any programming abilities. Middleware is considered as main part of the proposed technique which provides high availability of data in case of failures by utilizing the checkpointing. Experimental results reveal that the proposed technique provides efficient results, especially in case of any kind of failures in distributed NoSQL servers. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

abstract={Algorithms used for day ahead generation scheduling are crucial for a power system operator to balance conflicting objectives and the network constraints. Practically feasible algorithms using parallel computing, low-cost hardware and open-source software in power system parlance are rarely attempted in the literature. In this paper, a multicore processing-based genetic algorithm is proposed for finding the optimum solution of economic emission dispatch considering the reliability indices. Continuous genetic algorithm is used to improve the speed of the algorithm. Cost minimization and emission minimization are considered as the objectives to find the set of pareto-optimal solutions. The final solution is selected from the pareto-optimal set based on the reliability of generating stations. The insight used to improve the search space is the usage of two cores of a dual core processor in parallel, with different parameters of genetic algorithm. The constraints are handled using repair function and penalty factors, based on the feasibility of implementation. The algorithm is tested on IEEE 30 Bus, 6 generator system and IEEE 57 Bus system. The results show that the multicore processing using different parameters of genetic algorithm has improved the performance. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Predictive maintenance of industrial equipment has become a critical aspect in the Industry 4.0. This paper shows the design, implementation and testing of an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) system designed to monitor electric motors in real-time. This system will be the basis for detection of operating anomalies and a future predictive maintenance system. The system has been designed using low-cost hardware components (wireless multi-sensor modules and single-board computer as gateway), open-source software and a free version of an IoT analytics service in the cloud, where all the relevant information is stored. The module gathers real-time data about the vibrations and temperature of an electric motor. Vibration analysis in the temporal and frequency domains was carried out. Furthermore, analysis in the frequency domain was carried out both in the module and in the gateway to compare their capabilities. This approach is also the springboard to take advantage of edge and fog computing as a complement to cloud computing. The prototype has been tested in a laboratory and in an industrial dairy plant. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract={During a disaster, the more coordinated the response, the lesser its impacts are. One of the factors that has a major influence in response coordination is the interoperability among involved actors - public and private entities that interact to exchange information through the communication of people and systems. This factor is critical because it allows an efficient and effective mobilization of available resources towards reducing the effects caused by an event. This work proposes a framework for the development of Disaster Management Systems (DMS) that promote real time communication (information flow and process coordination) among different involved entities, primarily focusing on interoperability in its different levels. This framework is based both on a literature review of scientific works and a survey of worldwide initiatives related to improving disaster response. The main components of the related framework architecture are an SDK (software development kit), a common relational database, multiple communication platforms (e.g., a Web portal and a mobile app), and low-cost hardware to better collect and make needed information available quickly and accurately. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

abstract={Forest fire disasters have arisen each year due to a number of factors. The main interest of the authorities is to fight against these fires as early as possible with a minimum of damage, by exploiting recent technologies suitable for this field. In this paper, we present the design and the implementation of a forest fire detection system based on the Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN) technology applied to our region (M'sila forest, Oran city-Algeria) using a field experiment testbed with low cost hardware and software. In our previous study, the designed system detects the fire using a mono modal approach (the sensed data was scalar in nature such as the temperature and humidity). In this work, we enhanced this system by collecting, in addition, richer information sources using cameras as data sources (by capturing images) to eliminate the false alarms which present the main weakness of the first system. We call this new system as Multimedia Forest Fire System (M2FS). Field experiments that we have carried out using the testbed under different scenarios by evaluating the image compression, time constraint and energy consumption, allowed us to validate our chosen technology (Arduino mote) for any application (scalar or multimedia), and also revealed the supremacy of the multimodal approach to mitigate efficiently false alarms. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Open source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) are two expressions of one broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation. © 2018 The Authors R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the “Arduino” open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines.

abstract={Increasing demand for automatic management of agricultural production and real-time remote monitoring has increased the need for smart devices, wireless technologies, and sensors. The internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a common technology for the management of multiple devices by multiple users. Some professional solutions are relatively difficult to implement for researchers who are interested in agricultural IoT but do not have requisite skills in computers and electronics. The unfriendliness of the user software limits the practical application of agricultural IoT in China. This article presents a simple solution based on an SoC (system-on-chip) and WeChat mini-program that focuses on low-cost hardware, rapid development, user-friendly application design, and helping developers get a quick start in building a DIY monitoring system. The ESP8266, a high-performance SoC, is used as the microcontroller and Wi-Fi module to transfer the sensor data to a remote server. A WeChat mini-program provides the graphical user interface, enabling users to manage devices and access data by clicking. Users can log into the system using their WeChat accounts and bind devices by scanning QR codes on the devices. Thus, the complex management and device binding in conventional systems can be overcome. The system is easy to be expand and has great potential for greenhouse environmental monitoring in China. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

abstract={Due to their widespread use in veterinary medicine, the presence of tetracyclines (TCs) and their metabolites in foodstuffs from treated animal represents a growing concern for human health and nutrition and, therefore, many countries have established maximum levels for their presence in foods. The compliance with these legislations requires sensitive and selective methods for the determination of this antibiotics’ family in different matrices. In this sense, electrochemical sensors and biosensors are competitive methodologies versus other approaches commonly used for this purpose such as chromatography and ELISA methods, mainly in terms of low-cost equipment, minimal sample treatment, reduced turnaround time, and compatibility with multiplexed and point-of-care determinations. With this background in mind, this article reviews in a general but comprehensive way recent contributions of electrochemical (bio)sensors developed for the determination of TCs and applied to TC analysis in environmental samples, food, and biological matrices. The highlighted representative methods show the key role played both by the materials (mostly nanomaterials and polymers) employed to impart surface electrocatalytic properties and significant signal amplification, and by different (bio)receptors to provide electrochemical sensing with the sensitivity and selectivity demanded by the determination of TCs in environmental, clinical, and food samples. Main challenges to overcome and future prospects to turn over all the benefits of these simple, rapid, sensitive, selective, and cost effective electroanalytical (bio)tools in single or multiplexed TCs analysis, even at decentralized settings and after minimal sample treatment, are also pointed out. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Pulse Transition Time (PTT) is being increasingly used for estimating blood pressure unobtrusively aiming at continuous assessment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and illness monitoring using portable and low-cost equipment. Several methods are available for PTT estimation, each one accepting its own constraints and physical parameters’ assumptions, besides the panoply of definitions attributed to PTT calculus. Defining PTT as the time difference between the time instant were peak R occurred in an electrocardiogram (ECG) cardiac cycle and the time instant were the photoplestimography (PPG) signal of correspondent cardiac cycle presents the inflexion point of its maximum slope, a method of PTT estimation based on measured ECG and PPG signals during several cardiac cycles is proposed. This method was tested on ECG and PPG data collected from 7 individuals for periods ranging from 30 min to 8 h. For the sake of PTT algorithm performance evaluation, ECG and PPG signals were collected with a commercial system, together with the PTT signals provided by the same equipment resultant from automatic computation with unknown algorithm. Preliminary results so far obtained encourage the use of the proposed PTT estimation algorithm on future internet of things (IoT) e-health system development aiming at elderly blood pressure estimation and CVD assessment. Accuracy of the proposed algorithm (0.9 correlation with reference signal) may be improved by further studies on raw data filtering parametrizations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Goal: This paper proposes a reliable stress and relaxation level estimation algorithm that is implemented in a portable, low-cost hardware device and executed in real time. The main objective of this work is to offer an affordable and 'ready-to-go' solution for medical and personal environments, in which the detection of the arousal level of a person is crucial. Methods: To achieve meaningful identification of stress and relaxation, a fuzzy algorithm based on expert knowledge is built according to parameters extracted from physiological records. In addition to the heart rate, parameters extracted from the galvanic skin response and breath are employed to extend the results. Moreover, this algorithm achieves accurate results with a restricted computational load and can be implemented in a miniaturized low-cost prototype. The developed solution includes standard and actively shielded electrodes that are connected to an Arduino device for acquisition, while parameter extraction and fuzzy processing are conducted with a more powerful Raspberry Pi board. The proposed solution is validated using real physiological registers from 42 subjects collected using BIOPAC MP36 hardware. Additionally, a real-time acquisition, processing and remote cloud storage service is integrated via IoT wireless technology. Results: Robust identification of stress and relaxation is achieved, with F1 scores of 91.15% and 96.61%, respectively. Moreover, processing is performed using a 20-second sliding window; thus, only a small frame of context is required. Significance: This work presents a reliable solution for identifying stress and relaxation levels in real time, which can lead to the production of low-cost commercial devices for use in medical and personal environments. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Mechanical ventilation is commonly used for environmental thermal regulation inside closed-field agricultural production systems. Analyzing the air distribution inside these facilities and the correct operation of the fans can be a challenging. This could be determined using cost prohibitive techniques as particle image velocimetry or deploying large wind sensors networks on-site. To avoid this limitation without a lack of measurement accuracy, this research was focused on developing and test a low-cost anemometer network based in low cost propeller’s anemometers, built using fused 3D-printed and open-hardware platforms. Four propeller anemometers with three to six blades were simulated using the 6-DOF method of ANSYS computer fluid dynamics software. Similar results were obtained for all the simulated models with minor differences. Anemometers were tested in an open circuit wind tunnel before to be evaluated in two open compost dairy barn building using high-volume low-speed and low-volume high-speed fans. Data were analyzed by employing contour maps, descriptive statistics and correlation. The results show that the anemometer network determines the fan’s wind profile for wind speeds over 0.7 m s-1 and it was possible to determine the facilities spots with ventilation problems. The proposed anemometer network and methodology are a good alternative to analyze the operating conditions of the tested agricultural facilities and optimize its performance. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

abstract={Building novel analytical systems requires various elements: Sensors, a sampling system and data evaluation software. For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: “LABI-Imaging” for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and “RmsiGUI”, a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers’ community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nowadays, the use of the hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation has gained popularity among researchers all over the world. One of its main applications is the simulation of power electronics converters. However, the equipment designed for this purpose is difficult to acquire for some universities or research centers, so ad-hoc solutions for the implementation of HIL simulation in low-cost hardware for power electronics converters is a novel research topic. However, the information regarding implementation is written at a high technical level and in a specific language that is not easy for non-expert users to understand. In this paper, a systematic methodology using LabVIEW software (LabVIEW 2018) for HIL simulation is shown. A fast and easy implementation of power converter topologies is obtained by means of the differential equations that define each state of the power converter. Five simple steps are considered: designing the converter, modeling the converter, solving the model using a numerical method, programming an off-line simulation of the model using fixed-point representation, and implementing the solution of the model in a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This methodology is intended for people with no experience in the use of languages as Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) for Real-Time Simulation (RTS) and HIL simulation. In order to prove the methodology’s effectiveness and easiness, two converters were simulated—a buck converter and a three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI)—and compared with the simulation of commercial software (PSIM® v9.0) and a real power converter. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) refers to an integration concept of different communication systems used for connecting heterogeneous devices with constraints on processing, storage capabilities and power consumption to the Internet, with the purpose of data collecting for analysis and decision making about the measurements of data collected. This new paradigm can be applied in different fields to wirelessly measure variables through mobile devices, laptops and wireless devices having in mind restrictions in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. This paper describes the implementation of a flexible and low-cost monitoring and data collecting platform using sensors based on open hardware such as Arduino, interconnected through a LoRa network and a cloud-based data storage system developed using open source code. The main objective is to quickly collect different types of variables based on a flexible monitoring and collecting platform adaptable to different types of sensors which could be used in both rural and urban areas in applications that require long-range transmission and low energy consumption. In the future, research on the analysis of performance and improvement solutions will be carried out, as well as the use of other types of devices and protocols in order to compare performance and expand the field of implementation of the proposed platform. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens to overwhelm our medical infrastructure at the regional level causing spikes in mortality rates because of shortages of critical equipment, like ventilators. Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings. © 2020 Pearce JM.},

abstract={The lower cost of sensors is making possible the acquisition of big data sets in several applications and research areas. Indoor air quality and commuter exposure to pollutants are some of these areas, which can have impacts on our livelihood. The main objective of this exploratory research was to assemble portable equipment along with a prototype, one low-cost and easy to replicate in any location worldwide. We answer how CO2, noise and energy expenditure compare in different transportation modes with indoor environments (metro, bus and car). It was intended to be carried by a subject on all commutes. The low-cost equipment assembled has the ability to measure ambient CO2, noise levels, heart rate and geographic coordinates. The field campaign was conducted on an urban commuting route, in Lisbon city, between Rossio (downtown of Lisbon city) and Campo Grande (near FCUL campus). It took place during 3 weeks in school break and 3 weeks in the school period to grasp some differences between these periods of the year. The heart rate data was used to calculate the subject energy expenditure and the geographic coordinate data allowed for time and spatial analysis using a geospatial software package. Our measurements totaled 70 one-way trips and 358,140 data points. Temporal and spatial analysis yielded the following results: The metro presents the lowest median CO2 concentrations of 693 ppm and the bus the highest with 1085 ppm. The bus had an equivalent continuous sound average (Leq) of 75 dBA, while the metro had 85.2 dBA. Based on the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) calculations, the metro displays the least sedentary behavior, while the bus presents the most sedentary behavior with up to 96.5% of its commute spent in this classification. The metro was the fastest mode of transportation based on the consistency of its travel times compared to the bus, which despite also being consistent, was slower by 1.8 times. The car measurement values reside in the middle of the metro and bus results. Despite this, it is considered the worst mode of transportation, as it goes against the idea of a less congested and clean city. It also has a highly variable commuting time, which sometimes makes it slower than the metro, especially during the school period. According to our results, we concluded that the metro had efficient indoor ventilation while the bus did not. There were several instances of inefficient ventilation with concentrations exceeding 1000 ppm, particularly between Restauradores and Saldanha due to overcrowding. Referring to the health impacts of noise, the metro dBA levels are not sustained for enough time to have any measurable negative impact. Sensor performance was considered acceptable for the CO2 sensor. The dBA and heart rate (HR) sensors were considered acceptable to sometimes irregular in nature, which was expected and taken into consideration. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={A predictable network performance is mission critical for many applications and yet hard to provide due to difficulties in modeling the behavior of the increasingly complex network equipment. This paper studies the problem of providing deterministic latency guarantees in small networks based on low-capacity hardware (e.g., in-cabin and industrial networks): such networks are of increasing importance, need to meet stringent performance requirements, but have hardly been explored so far. Our main contribution is the design, implementation, and evaluation of Loko, a system which provides predictable latency guarantees in programmable networks using low-cost hardware. Loko relies on a novel measurement-based methodology and uses deterministic network calculus to derive a reliable performance model of a given switch. To this end, we also show that state-of-the-art models in the literature like QJump and Silo fall short to model the behavior of such switches, due to incorrect architectural and performance assumptions. As a case study, we implement Loko for the Zodiac FX switch. Our experiments are encouraging: we find that the derived models are indeed accurate, allowing Loko to provide deterministic end-to-end guarantees with low-cost programmable devices. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={An important area in precision agriculture is related to the efficient use of chemicals applied onto fields. Efforts have been made to diminish their use, aiming at cost reduction and fewer chemical residues in the final agricultural products. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents itself as an attractive and cheap alternative for spraying pesticides and fertilizers compared to conventional mass spraying performed by ordinary manned aircraft. Besides being cheaper than manned aircraft, small UAVs are capable of performing fine-grained instead of the mass spraying. Observing this improved method, this paper reports the design of an embedded real-time UAV spraying control system supported by onboard image processing. The proposal uses a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) algorithm to detect the exact locations in which the chemicals are needed. Using this information, the automated spraying control system performs punctual applications while the UAV navigates over the crops. The system architecture is designed to run on low-cost hardware, which demands an efficient NDVI algorithm. The experiments were conducted using Raspberry Pi 3 as the embedded hardware. First, experiments in a laboratory were conducted in which the algorithm was proved to be correct and efficient. Then, field tests in real conditions were conducted for validation purposes. These validation tests were performed in an agronomic research station with the Raspberry hardware integrated into a UAV flying over a field of crops. The average CPU usage was about 20% while memory consumption was about 70 MB for high definition images, with 4% CPU usage and 20.3 MB RAM being observed for low-resolution images. The average current measured to execute the proposed algorithm was 0.11 A. The obtained results prove that the proposed solution is efficient in terms of processing and energy consumption when used in embedded hardware and provides measurements which are coherent with the commercial GreenSeeker equipment. © 2019 by the authors.

We have assessed the performance of this device in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Background Noise Level (BNL), an adapted MPEG7 feature for electrocardiography signals. This platform outperforms other commercial devices and most similar state-of-art studies on SNR. Results show values of 11.96, 30.01, 68.40 dB for ECG, EDA and ST, respectively, for SNR, and -28.31 dB for BNL in ECG.

abstract={Rotary kilns are important industrial plants for the refinery of materials. Effective monitoring of rotary kilns is therefore crucial to the successful operation in order to optimise the flame and reduce waste. In this industrial application-driven work, we describe such a system recently developed and successfully deployed. Our work aims at efficient real-time performance and accuracy for given operating constraints. Our contributions include novel methods that provide accurate depth calibration and mapping, detect and segment the flame, and estimate the flame bed position accurately in challenging conditions. For preprocessing, we use a multi-frame approach and carefully select an optimal window size. Then, we derive a mathematical model for depth calibration and mapping of the kiln and demonstrate the accuracy of the model. Finally, we propose a comprehensive pipeline for segmenting and detecting flame and provide an in-depth analysis of our method. Our evaluation shows that the proposed system performs well and meet real-time requirements whilst using only low-cost hardware. © 2019 IEEE.},

This hinders the users natural experience as it creates a barrier between the user and computer as well as they are costly and take up lots of space on the desk. There are few hand tracking systems available in the market, but they are complex and expensive. The development of a marker-less hand tracking system and gesture recognition with low-cost hardware is presented here. The proposed system is a simple but effective method that allows rapid manual tracking despite the complex background. This system eliminates motion blur and is able to detect gestures like clicking and also hand tracking. The detected gesture is converted into specific functional inputs like clicking and mouse movement to control other applications. A voice module is integrated to receive voice commands from the user and perform it. This enables intuitive HCI and interactive motion gaming. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGAs, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature codebase reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

abstract={The main task while developing a mobile robot is to achieve accurate and robust navigation in a given environment. To achieve such a goal, the ability of the robot to localize itself is crucial. In outdoor, namely agricultural environments, this task becomes a real challenge because odometry is not always usable and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals are blocked or significantly degraded. To answer this challenge, this work presents a solution for outdoor localization based on an omnidirectional visual odometry technique fused with a gyroscope and a low cost planar light detection and ranging (LIDAR), that is optimized to run in a low cost graphical processing unit (GPU). This solution, named FAST-FUSION, proposes to the scientific community three core contributions. The first contribution is an extension to the state-of-the-art monocular visual odometry (Libviso2) to work with omnidirectional cameras and single axis gyro to increase the system accuracy. The second contribution, it is an algorithm that considers low cost LIDAR data to estimate the motion scale and solve the limitations of monocular visual odometer systems. Finally, we propose an heterogeneous computing optimization that considers a Raspberry Pi GPU to improve the visual odometry runtime performance in low cost platforms. To test and evaluate FAST-FUSION, we created three open-source datasets in an outdoor environment. Results shows that FAST-FUSION is acceptable to run in real-time in low cost hardware and that outperforms the original Libviso2 approach in terms of time performance and motion estimation accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Fiber photometry is the process of recording bulk neural activity by measuring fluorescence changes in activity sensitive indicators such as GCaMP through an optical fiber. We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Flood risk prediction requires consistent and accurate sensor measurements, usually provided from traditional in-situ environmental monitoring systems. Crowd-sourced data can complement these official data sources, allowing authorities to improve and fill gaps in the hazard assessment process. However, collecting this information from volunteers, with no technical knowledge and while using low-cost equipment such their smart phones and tablets, raises the question of quality and consistency. To alleviate this barrier two mobile applications were developed in the context of H2020 Scent project (grant agreement No. 688930). The Scent Explore guides volunteers to areas of interests and supports them in the collection of video and images. These multimedia are processed in the back-end, image recognition techniques extract the water level from images containing a measuring tape and video processing algorithms extract the water surface velocity from video containing a predefined floating object moving on the surface of a water body, to extract river measurements as needed. The Scent Measure communicates with the portable sensors available at the area of interest and records the air temperature and the soil moisture. We present here a complete monitoring system where crowd-sourced environmental measurements are harmonised and integrated as complementary to the in-situ monitoring system, installed at the Kifisos basin, in the process of developing improved flood models. © 2019 IEEE.},

Moreover, the low-cost equipment and the ability to deposit various metals make WAAM a strong candidate to become a standard industrial process. However, like all Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, the key to manufacturing suitable parts lies in the generation of an optimised path that guarantees a uniform defect-free deposition. Most AM technologies have been able to use traditional path strategies derived from CNC machining, but the specificities inherent to the arc deposition make the use of those solutions unreliable across a variety of topologies. Nevertheless, studies have shown that superior results can be achieved by using a feature-based design approach, but developing a path strategy for each new geometry would be a very time-consuming task. Therefore, this paper introduces the Modular Path Planning (MPP) solution that aims to incorporate the modularity of feature-based design into the traditional layer-by-layer strategy. By dividing each layer into individual deposition sections, this method allows users to adapt the path planning to the targeted geometry allowing the construction of a wide variety of complex geometries. This paper also proposes a software implementation that limits user interventions and reduces user inputs to basic CAD modelling operations. Moreover, the MPP has been compared to a traditional path planning solution and used to build a complex part for industry. © 2019},

abstract={Azimuthal beam scanning eliminates the uneven excitation field arising from laser interference in through-objective total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware, API, and software, is available online for community-based development and collaboration. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Large scale deployment of Smart Grids (SGs) and Smart Micro-Grids (SMGs) requires overcoming problems related to interoperability and high costs. To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are reported. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Due to the influence of current sampling and current reconstruction deviation, non-linearity of the inverters and parameter variation of the motors, DC offset component and high-order harmonic components exist in flux model, which makes the estimation of traditional rotor flux observer inaccurate and even divergent. In this paper, a rotor flux observer of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) with adaptive flux compensation is proposed. The DC offset component and the high-order harmonic components with the flux integrator observer can be eliminated by fed them back to the input of the flux integrator through PI regulator, so that the output of the flux integrator observer only contains the fundamental component, thus the rotor flux can be accurately estimated. Since the parameters of PI regulator are related with the estimated motor angular velocity, the control system has good robustness in a wide speed range. The flux observer is based on the voltage model in stationary coordinate system, so it is suitable for both surface and interior PMSMs. Moreover, the control method of the whole system has less computational complexity and fewer variables, it is easy to implement on a low-cost hardware platform. Finally, the experimental results verify that the flux observer has superior performance. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, additive manufacturing (AM) has been successfully employed to fabricate heat exchangers due to its ability to create complex geometrical structures with high volumetric-to-area ratio, which can be designed to increase convective heat transfer from surfaces. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most popular AM methods due to it is accessible and low-cost hardware. The effect of process parameters on the mechanical properties of FFF 3D-printed parts has been studied extensively. However, there are limited reliable data for the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed components which has impeded the development of additively manufactured heat exchangers. In the current study, the effect of the layer height and raster width have been investigated experimentally and numerically to characterize the effective thermal conductivity of 3D-printed components and investigate the thermal anisotropic nature of unidirectional printed parts. The results showed that increasing the layer height and width causes deterioration in the effective thermal conductivity of up to 65% of the pure polymer. In addition, the thermal conductivity was measured for a range of PLA composites and it was found that their anisotropic ratio can be as high as 2. The unidirectional effective conductivity model was subsequently modified to characterize the common cross-hatched layer fill configuration, and the influence of fill ratio on the effective thermal conductivity was investigated. Finally, the effective thermal conductivity of several commercially available PLA composite filaments was characterized experimentally. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={5G New Radio's (NR) spectrum expansion towards higher bands, although critical towards achieving the envisioned 5G capacity requirements, creates the need for installing a very large number of Access Points (APs), which asserts tremendous capital burden on the Mobile Network Operators. Current centralization solutions such as the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) alleviate partially the costs of densification by moving the majority of radio processing functionalities from the Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) to the central Base Band Unit (BBU), but still require very high-speed Point-to-Point links between the BBU and each RRH mainly due to the digitized Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) that is excessively inefficient for hauling broadband signals. In this article, we present a novel architecture that employs an analog converged Fiber-Wireless scheme in order to create a very spectrally efficient Point-to-Multipoint network capable of interconnecting a large number of APs, while allowing compatibility with mature Ethernet-based low-cost equipment. Preliminary simulation results show very low end-to-end Ethernet packet delay, well below eCPRI's 100 μs mark, even for fiber lengths up to 10 km, indicating the suitability of our solution for employment in 5G NR large-scale fronthaul networks. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Accurate laser scanning of plaster casts using validated, low-cost hardware represents a key issue in 3D orthodontics. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of measurements taken from plaster casts (gold standard) with digital models of those casts created with a low-cost structural light DAVID laser scanner. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five different measurements were taken on each of 14 plaster casts by 2 independent observers with an electronic caliper. The measurements were repeated 10 times on all 14 plaster casts by each observer, with a 1-week interval between each set of measurements. All 14 plaster casts were digitized using a low-cost DAVID SLS 3 laser scanner. The same 5 measurements were performed on each of the 3D virtual surface models of the 14 plaster casts by 2 independent observers using Meshlab software in a manner similar to that used with the digital caliper. The measurements were repeated 10 times by the 2 observers with 1 week between each set of measurements. RESULTS: The laser-scanned models were more accurate than the plaster cast models in defining measurements based on simple tooth fissures. The accuracy of measurements based on complex tooth fissures were equivalent for the 2 types of model. For measurements based on interproximal dental contacts, the 2 methods of measurement were similar and both were notably poor in terms of accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional virtual models obtained from the low-cost DAVID laser scanner can be used clinically, but only for certain types of measurements and indications.},

abstract={In this study, the authors propose a method to implement a low-cost hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system for power converters and microgrids design, test and analysis. This approach uses a digital signal processor (DSP) Texas Instruments as the HIL core. All the differential equations of the power converters are solved in real-time by the DSP and displayed in the digital-to-analogue outputs. Three different converters are modelled in this study: boost converter, single-phase inverter connected to the grid and three-phase inverter connected to the grid. Experimental results are obtained and compared to the HIL response. These results were made triggering the real converter and the HIL with the same open-loop pulse width modulation signal, showing high fidelity between the digital models over the real systems. In a second moment, a microgrid is modelled in the proposed HIL and tested with a closed-loop controller. The experiments show that the proposed hardware supports time steps as low as 1 μs or 1 MHz update rate, depending on the model. The proposed technique has the potential to reduce testing time and cost, once commercial HIL devices such as Typhoon, dSPACE and RTDS have a significant cost, not affordable or available to all the research community. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.},

abstract={The power efficiency of photovoltaic modules is highly correlated with their health status. Under dynamically changing environments, photovoltaic defects could spontaneously form and develop into fatal faults during the daily operation of photovoltaic plants. To facilitate defect detection with less human intervention, a nondestructive and contactless visual inspection system with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and edge computing is proposed in this work. Limited by the resources of edge devices and the availability of images of photovoltaic defects for training, we developed an online solution combined with deep learning, data argumentation and transfer learning to properly address the issues of running resource hungry applications on edge devices and lack of training samples faced by the deep learning approaches used in the field. With the reduction of the network depth of the deep convolutional neural network model and the transfer of features from the learned defects, the resource consumption of our proposed approach is significantly reduced, and thus can be used on a wide range of edge devices to complete defect detection in a timely manner with high accuracy. To study the performance of our design, a testbed was built from open source hardware and software, and field trials were carried out in three photovoltaic plants. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our design for detecting visible defects on photovoltaic modules. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={Improvement of the output power under different weather conditions is one of the major concerns for photovoltaic (PV) system design. The perturbation and observation (P&O) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is the most commonly used technique in practice due to its simplicity and ease of implementation in low-cost hardware. However, the conventional fixed-step P&O tracking method uses a fixed iteration step size based on the requirements of the steady - state accuracy and the speed of the algorithm. In addition, it is very hard to specify the variable step-size scaling factor (M) under fast ripped change of insolation. This paper presents an adaptative multi-variable step-size to solve the trade-off between the speed of the algorithm and efficiency at steady-state. Computer simulation is carried out on MATLAB/Simulink to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. By using multi-variable step-size algorithm, MPPT response speed and accuracy can be significantly enhanced under rapid change of irradiance compared to one scaling variable step-size P&O method. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents an intelligent electronic device (IED) utilized for automatic meter readings (AMR) scheme using “Open-Source” software. This IED is utilized to measure a low-voltage intelligent electronic device) system with a boundless number of sensors, and it is accessible on the Internet of Things (IoT). The utilized equipment for this task is Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and fringe sensors, which are used for measurement of the referenced information. The Arduino motherboard is used not only for sole tranquility of equipment but also for serving as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) switch for the sensors. The personal computer is utilized to gather information and perform client-side calculations. The server works based on an open-source program written in Java programming language. The underlying objective of the proposed scheme is to make the meter based on the “Do It Yourself” methodology which requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of measured information and convenience for the conclusive client. The information is measured in just about 1 ms which is superb for custom-designed IED. Furthermore, the measured qualities are calculated based on their RMS values to be used for analyzing and further presentation of data. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The capillary spread of personal devices equipped with wireless communication capabilities has enabled a series of high level services which build on capturing and processing the data packets emitted by such devices. In this paper we tackle the problem of exploiting such a methodology to perform occupancy estimation, i.e., understanding how many people are present in a specific place, an information which is valuable in many scenarios (HVAC and lighting system control, building energy optimisation, allocation and reservation of spaces, etc.). Traditional systems for occupancy estimation rely either on environmental sensors (CO2, temperature, humidity) or video cameras, which both have drawbacks: the former have generally low accuracy, while the latter require high setup and maintenance costs. In this paper we depart from such traditional approaches and propose a cheap and accurate occupancy estimation system based on the capture of both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy management frames transmitted from users’ devices. The system, implemented on low-cost hardware, leverages a supervised learning model to adapt to different spaces and transmits estimated occupancy information to a web-based dashboard. Experimental results in both indoor and outdoor uncontrolled scenarios demonstrate the validity of the proposed solution. © 2019},

abstract={There is a growing interest in the open-source hardware movement to amortize non-recurring engineering costs by using plug-and-play system-on-chip (SoC) designs, where the communication among different components is provided by an on-chip interconnection network. Unfortunately, building an on-chip network (OCN) that is suitable for a specific SoC design requires the exploration of a large number of design options and involves diverse research methodologies to evaluate performance, area, energy, and timing. In this paper, we propose PyOCN, a unified framework that vertically integrates multiple research methodologies to enable productively exploring the OCN design space. PyOCN is the first comprehensive framework for modeling (e.g., functional-level, cycle-level, and register-transfer-level), testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, and property-based random testing), and evaluating (e.g., simulating, generating, and characterizing) on-chip interconnection networks. We use a case study based on a 64-terminal butterfly network to illustrate the key features of PyOCN and to demonstrate the framework's potential in productively modeling, testing, and evaluating OCNs. © 2019 IEEE.},

The device is intentionally designed to be used in lattice-type metamorphic robots, however, its applicability is much wider. The main novelty of our solution lies primarily in a new unique flat design and spatial compactness of the connector. With a flat connector, much more space is left for the body of a robotic module in the structure. Moreover, the connector is also fully self-contained device with well defined mechanical, electrical and data interfaces, hence it can be easily embedded in various robotic solutions. Our RoFICoM connector is easy to produce, it is open-hardware and free for non-commercial use.

abstract={Wireless sensor network nodes are deployed in the places that are difficult to reach and maintain. Once a failure of sensor nodes occurs, debugging interaction depends on the network infrastructure. However, some wireless communication malfunctions very lead to sensor nodes lost from the network. Traditional debugging interactions based on the networks become invalid. In addition, due to the low-cost hardware structure of the sensor node, it is hard to provide additional interactions. To this end, this paper mines the potentialities of visible light sensor and light emitting unit and realizes a mixed-duplex debugging interaction system (DIS) based on visible light communication. Moreover, for the downlink of DIS, the sensing delay of ambient light sensor decreases the data transmitting rate. A compressed dual-header pulse interval modulation to the increase data transmitting rate is presented. And also, for the uplink of DIS, the light emitting unit of sensor node cannot match the image frame of camera generation, so a frame synchronization applied in camera rolling shutter mechanism is presented. The experiment results illustrates that the throughput of CDH-PIM is 11.09% higher than that of DH-PIM, and the energy consumption is reduced by 8.70%. The uplink frame synchronization scheme can achieve a data transfer rate of 600 b/s at 30 fps. © Copyright 2019, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

In this point of view, a simple and robust target detection, tracking and avoidance system is designed. Two open-source tools were used for the aim: a state-of-the-art object detection technique called SSD and an API for MAVLink compatible systems called MAVSDK. The MAVSDK performs velocity control when a UAV is detected so that the manoeuvre is done simply and efficiently. The proposed system was verified with Software in the loop (SITL) and Hardware in the loop (HITL) simulators. The simplicity of this algorithm makes it innovative, and therefore it should be used in future applications needing robust performances with low-cost hardware such as delivery drone applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Generally, ultrasound receive beamformers calculate the focusing time delays of fixed sound speeds in human tissue (e.g., 1540 m/s). However, phase distortions occur due to variations of sound speeds in soft tissues, resulting in degradation of image quality. Thus, an optimal estimation of sound speed is required in order to improve image quality. Implementation of real-time sound speed estimation is challenging due to high computational and hardware complexities. In this paper, an optimal sound speed estimation method with a low-cost hardware resource is presented. In the proposed method, the optimal mean sound speed is determined by measuring the amplitude variance of pre-beamformed radio-frequency (RF) data. The proposed method was evaluated with phantom and in vivo experiments, and implemented on Virtex-4 with Xilinx ISE 12.4 using VHDL. Experiment results indicate that the proposed method could estimate the mean optimal sound speed and enhance spatial resolution with a negligible increase in the hardware resource usage. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={In this paper, we design a sampled-data H∞ fuzzy observer for nonlinear systems under variable sampling periods. To do so, a linear matrix inequality-based design condition is derived to stabilize the error vector consisting of the difference of the state vectors of the observer and the system. When deriving the condition, we propose a time-dependent fuzzy Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with discrete time membership functions to obtain numerically less conservative condition. Also, since the proposed method allows the sampling time to be variable, it can be used in low-cost hardwares that do not meet the strict sampling period. Finally, in the hardware experiment, the proposed method is applied to design the attitude and heading reference system that estimates the Euler angles from inertial sensor data, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

abstract={Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware–embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for Arduino™ and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino™ or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.},

abstract={Precise time synchronization is an important requirement for a wide set of distributed applications in which timestamped data should be produced by distributed nodes and then correlated with a limited amount of timing. There are several techniques and protocols that address this issue, however, most of them rely on specialized hardware and/or software solutions, thus incurring on relatively high cost to deploy a synchronization network. In this paper, a low-cost approach to synchronize a wireless sensor network is proposed and applied in the context of an electrical power monitoring system, which is then used to build a dataset that supports research in the area of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). The monitoring system is designed to detect load events on several distributed nodes of a power circuit and to synchronize, with a millisecond precision, the voltage and current data collected on them. Results show that such a precision can be achieved with simple and relatively low-cost hardware, enabling this solution to be used on several contexts where the budget and time requirements are important concerns. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars are an important class of radar systems, and they are quite popular because of their simpler architecture and lower cost. A fundamental problem in FMCW radars is the nonlinearity of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which results in a range of measurement errors, problems in multitarget detection, and degradation in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this paper, we first introduce a novel upsampling theory, then propose new algorithms to improve range accuracy and multitarget detection capability. These improvements are demonstrated both by simulations and actual lab experiments on a 2.4 GHz radar system. There are several techniques reported in the literature for VCO nonlinearity correction, but what makes the proposed approach different is that we focus on real-time processing on low-cost hardware and optimize the design subject to this constraint. We first developed an optimal upsampling theory which is based on almost-causal finite impulse response (FIR) filters. Compared to the sinc-based noncausal interpolation-based upsamplers, the proposed approach is based on using interpolation filters with few number of coefficients. Furthermore, interpolators are trained for a specific class of signals rather than a highly general signal set. Therefore, the proposed approach can be implemented on lower-cost hardware and perform quite well compared to more expensive systems. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={As is commonly known, hardware in a computer system requires a processor to run the operating system. The primary architectures that form the basis of most processors are CISC and RISC. CISC includes long sub-level commands for effective memory management and simple compiler implementations to be developed. Thus CISC has a complex set of commands; hence the name Complex Instruction Set Computer. On the other hand, CISC has had backward compatibility since the 1970s. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), the other popular architecture, simplifies command sets and handles access to memory with load-store commands. Since the instruction set is simplified, the hardware runs faster. In addition, RISC-based processors contain less chip-sets and may be designed faster. Currently, with the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for RISC architectures has increased and its usage in embedded devices has become widespread. The ARM processor is a successful example of the RISC architecture adaptation. However, ARM processor production has certain license term limitations and contains a few design flaws in its architecture [1]. In 2010, the RISC-V processor architecture, which was developed as an open source instruction set at Berkeley University, paves the way for open source hardware in terms of its BSD license and design professionalism. As a result, it will be possible to produce their own processors for communities and organizations without license restrictions. In this paper, we discuss the building blocks of the development life-cycle of an open source operating system on the RISC-V architecture. As an operating system base, we implement MILIS Linux, an open source operating system development project. It has an independent user space and its own package manager. For a completely independent open source computing system, open source RISC-V hardware architecture provides the freedom that is needed. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid development of sensing, automation and communication technologies has led to the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), providing recognized promising opportunities to build complex industrial systems and applications, leveraging the growing ubiquity of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and wireless sensor devices. With the pervasiveness of the interconnected systems encompassed with an ever-growing number of RFID-enabled devices being deployed, RFID security is an issue of high concern. As lightweight security encryption primitive, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is used to protect the information security of low-cost devices. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable to attacks, so countermeasures should be employed in the design. Aimed at low-cost and security of connected IoT devices to satisfy various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, a two-stage multiple-choice arbiter (TSMCA)-based PUF in RFID systems is proposed, referred as TSMCA PUF. It is aimed at the design of a double PUF-based bidirectional RFID identity authentication protocol that permits the realization of bidirectional authentication between a server and a tag for the IC authentication in low-cost RFID systems, where the exclusive-OR (XOR) and character padding operations are adopted to generate the response of the PUF; the string-matching method is used in authentication, without exposing the PUF response to the verifier.

abstract={This paper describes the design, manufacture, and performance of a highly dexterous, low-profile, 7 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robotic arm for CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy. Direct CT guidance allows physicians to localize tumours quickly; however, needle insertion is still performed by hand. This system is mounted to a fully active motion stage superior to the patient's head and teleoperated by a radiologist. Unlike other similar robots, this robot's fully serial-link approach uses a unique combination of belt and cable drives for high-transparency and minimal-backlash, allowing for an expansive working area and numerous approach angles to targets, all while maintaining a small in-bore cross-section of less than 16cm2. Simulations verified the system's expansive collision free work-space and ability to hit targets across the entire chest, as required for lung cancer biopsy. Targeting error was on average &lt; 1mm on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. While this system was developed for lung biopsies, it can be easily modified for other CT-guided needle based procedures. Additionally, this system is open-hardware.1. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This work studied different digital embedded platforms which can be programmed using Arduino IDE software and which can be used for digital control and data acquisition applications. Specifically three kind of Arduino Board (Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega y Arduino Due) and two ESP based board (ESP8622 and ESP32) are evaluated and compared. The comparison is based on the execution time of mathematical operations and a function required for data acquisition or digital control and includes (i) digital ports writing, (ii) analog signal acquisition, (iii) execution of mathematic operation in integer and float format, and (iv) the execution of the data processing code. The execution time is measured by using a methodology which is simple to implement for any other digital device. Because of each platform uses its own Arduino DUE library to generate the assembly code for its own microcontroller, the instructions adopted for both generating the actions to measure and generating the testing signals are written using Arduino IDE commands and using instructions that any entry-level user may adopt. In conclusion, from the experimental results it is observed the high difference in the execution time of the different platforms, especially between ESPx boards and Arduino boards. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The control and monitoring of physical variables in real time is very important to the industry to guarantee the quality of products, industrial safety, the operation of the machines and the manufacturing process. Nowadays, the Salvadoran industry must adopt technologies associated with the Internet of Things. Understanding as Internet of Things the possibility to provide Internet connection to any object, giving the user the possibility to make physical measures or remote controlling. In this case, knowing that the impact that represent for industry the control and monitoring of physical variables is very important, ITCA FEPADE Regional Center of Santa Ana City has designed and implemented a IoT platform to monitor the physical variables with educational purposes. For the designing of the platform some open source tools were use. The hardware tools used were atmega 328p and xbee antennas. PHP, Java and C were the programming language used for the interface design. This IoT platform can control the electric charges and monitoring variables like: Electric current and power, electrical energy and temperature. For statistical measurement the computer center 2 and classroom 103 were chosen. For using this software, the user just needs a smartphone, a computer or a tablet to connect to the IoT platform. The user can visualize and have control of physical variables using the platform interface. Both devices (user device and the server) must be connected to the same network, in this case ITCA Santa Ana's network. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Deeply embedded applications require low-power, low-cost hardware that fits within stringent area constraints. Deep learning has many potential uses in these domains, but introduces significant inefficiencies stemming from off-chip DRAM accesses of model weights. Ideally, models would fit entirely on-chip. However, even with compression, memory requirements for state-of-the-art models make on-chip inference impractical. Due to increased density, emerging eNVMs are one promising solution. We present MaxNVM, a principled co-design of sparse encodings, protective logic, and fault-prone MLC eNVM technologies (i.e., RRAM and CTT) to enable highly-efficient DNN inference. We find bit reduction techniques (e.g., clustering and sparse compression) increase weight vulnerability to faults. This limits the capabilities of MLC eNVM. To circumvent this limitation, we improve storage density (i.e., bits-per-cell) with minimal overhead using protective logic. Tradeoffs between density and reliability result in a rich design space. We show that by balancing these techniques, the weights of large networks are able to reasonably fit on-chip. Compared to a naive, single-level-cell eNVM solution, our highly-optimized MLC memory systems reduce weight area by up to 29.We compare our technique against NVDLA, a state-of-the-art industry-grade CNN accelerator, and demonstrate up to 3.2 reduced power and up to 3.5 reduced energy per ResNet50 inference. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Neurophysiological observations are clarifying how astrocytes can actively participate in information processing and how they can encode information through frequency and amplitude modulation of intracellular Ca2+ signals. Consequently, hardware realization of astrocytes is important for developing the next generation of bio-inspired computing systems. In this paper, astrocytic calcium oscillations and neuronal firing dynamics are presented by De Pittà and IF (Integrated &amp; Fire) models, respectively. Considering highly nonlinear equations of the astrocyte model, linear approximation and single constant multiplication (SCM) techniques are employed for efficient hardware execution while maintaining the dynamic of the original models. This low-cost hardware architecture for the astrocyte model is able to show the essential features of different types of Ca2+ modulation such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or both modes (AFM). To show good agreement between the results of original models simulated in MATLAB and the proposed digital circuits executed on FPGA, quantitative, and qualitative analyses including phase plane are done. This new neuromorphic circuit of astrocyte is able to successfully demonstrate AM/FM/AFM calcium signaling in its real operation on FPGA and has applications in self-repairing systems. It also can be employed as a subsystem for linking biological cells to artificial neuronal networks using astrocytic calcium oscillations in future research. © Copyright © 2019 Faramarzi, Azad, Amiri and Linares-Barranco.},

abstract={The promise of widespread 5th generation (5G) and beyond wireless systems can only be fulfilled through extensive experimental campaigns aimed at validating the large body of theoretical findings on millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) frequencies. However, experimental research efforts in this field are often stymied by the lack of open hardware, open-source software, and affordable testbeds accessible by the research community at large, who is now forced to perform simulation-based research or – if at all possible – small-scale, ad hoc experiments. After discussing existing research challenges in mmWave and THz testbeds, in this paper we propose MillimeTera, a vision for a new generation of disruptive experimental platforms that will radically transform the status quo in mmWave and THz research. We next discuss our preliminary hardware and software efforts, and finally provide a roadmap of our main design and development goals in the years to come. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Small clinics in low-middle-income countries frequently lack the financial and technical resources to support patient-record automation—relying instead on paper records to track patient visits. Earlier successes introducing automated solutions into these clinics often eroded quickly after external support was withdrawn. The piClinic Console is designed to automate key aspects of patient information management in small, limited-resource clinics so as to introduce automation into a clinic in a way that the clinic can sustain with little or no additional support. Unlike previous efforts to scale down existing medical records systems for a small clinic, the piClinic Console was developed to include only the functions that benefit most from automation. The design was implemented to work on low-cost hardware to minimize initial cost and dependence on external support. After encouraging laboratory test results, this design was tested in four Honduran clinics to evaluate the users’ experiences and the utility of the design. Clinic response was universally positive; however, field testing identified that success relied on accommodating the different roles in the clinic, supporting at least one printer, and enabling multiple users to access the system from multiple devices. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Although cable-based seismic sensing systems have provided reliable data in the past several decades, they become a bottleneck for large-area monitoring and critical environmental (volcanic eruptions) sensing because of their cost, difficulty in deploying and expanding, and lack of accurate three-dimensional geographic information. In this paper, a new wireless sensing system is designed consisting of a portable satellite device, a self-sustaining power source, a low-cost computational core, and a high-precision sensor. The emphasis of this paper is to implement in low-cost hardware without requirements of highly specialized and expensive data acquisition instruments. Meanwhile, a computational-core-embedded algorithm based on compressive sensing (CS) is also developed to compress data size for transmission and encrypt the measured data preventing information loss. Seismic data captured by the accelerometer sensor are coded into compressive data packages and then transferred via satellite communication to a cloud-based server for storage. Acceleration and GPS information is decrypted by the ℓ1-norm minimization optimization algorithm for further processing. In this research, the feasibility of the proposed sensing system for the acquisition of seismic testing is investigated in an outdoor field surface wave testing. Results indicate the proposed low-cost wireless sensing system has the capability of collecting ground motions, transferring data, and sharing GPS information via satellite communication for large area monitoring. In addition, it has a great potential of recovering measurements even with significant data package loss. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and low signal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform (shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signals with better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule‐based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Instruments are a very important tool for the good comprehension of any science. In the engineering electrical field, most of the practice laboratories are equipped with a large set of devices. One of the major challenges to get a complete laboratory is the economic cost. Professional electronic devices as multi-meters, oscilloscopes or spectrum analyzers are quite expensive on the market. Fortunately, with the aid of software-defined radio (SDR), low-cost equipment can be built. A fundamental device in these projects is the RTL-SDR dongle. This electronic accessory captures wireless signals and puts them on a USB port. Therefore, with digital signal processing it is possible to get access to low-cost instruments like spectrum analyzers. In this work, an integration of hardware and software is presented. An application is developed with Python and implemented on a Raspberry Pi3 B+. This proposal captures, demodulates, and displays AM and FM signals. The signals obtained can be observed on frequency or time or can be recorded as well. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Syringe pumps are widely used in a multitude of tasks where precise volumes of an extrudate need to be delivered at a specific flow rate. In the past decade various open source syringe pump designs have accelerated scientific research and exploration by reducing costs and introducing new ideas. To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems. Here the dosing accuracy and repeatability of the Ystruder are quantified, and we demonstrate its functionality both as a syringe pump and a paste extruder for 3D printing. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person households, it is absolutely necessary to observe the indoor activities of marginalized people, such as the elderly or the disabled, to detect abnormal conditions. At this time, contact sensors are have limited applicability due to their continuous wear, so there is a need to develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing management prescription guidelines through risk detection. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper presents a new multi-agent framework using open-source software (MAFOSS). The proposed framework is a modular and cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is intended to help develop multiagent systems for research and education. Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to date that are used in various robotic applications, such as surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others. However, most of them are either tailored towards particular applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called 'eduMOD' mobile robots). The software architecture of the current framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS). Regardless of internal hardware and/or software architecture, appropriate actions can be applied to actuators of an individual or a team of mobile agents for controlling their motions. A few case studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of MAFOSS. © 2019 IEEE.},

In addition of being fully replicable, the setup features integration of a climate-controlled chamber, a peristaltic pump and an autosampler, thereby enabling fully automated but customized control of the experiments. Using the presented retention model setup and an automated experimental sequence, the setup has been proven capable of investigating mucoadhesion of differently shaped particles to porcine intestinal tissue. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Electromyography (sEMG) is the technique applied to measure the bio-potential signal produced by a contracting skeletal muscle. sEMG has been used for subject intention estimation, force estimation, limb angle estimation and determining muscle activation timing. Typically most sEMG devices on the market, and in literature, are not open source hardware. This results in a device that can be considered as a black box, as it is difficult to determine the applied signal processing. This paper presents an open source low-cost active sEMG circuit, allowing an understanding of sEMG and the challenges involved in designing a high quality device. An open source sEMG design reduces the time and cost associated with initial sEMG research, providing a larger number of researchers with the opportunity to utilise sEMG. The device has been tested on three subjects, resulting in a low baseline noise ⩽5.2μVrms and great line noise rejection, resulting in a sensitive device that can capture high quality bio-potential signals. © 2019 The Author(s)},

Simulation results suggested that our hardware system was able to process as many as 50M address events per second and achieved 75% classification accuracy for the popular MNIST-DVS dataset. Compared to other AER classification systems, our low-cost FPGA implementation is more plausible for embedded applications because of its similar accuracy and higher system throughput. © 2019 IEEE.},

Even with economies of scale, the price is prohibitively high for a lithium-ion battery pack capable of storing tens of kilowatts of energy for many consumers. A more abundant and less expensive material is necessary. All-iron chemistry presents a transformative opportunity for stationary energy storage: it is simple, cheap, abundant, and safe. All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode. The total cell is highly stable, efficient, non-toxic, and safe. The total cost of materials is $0.1 per watt-hour of capacity at wholesale prices. This battery may be a useful component of open source hardware projects that require a safe and ecologically friendly battery. This is also one of the few battery chemistries that can be built safely in a DIY setting. © 2019},

abstract={Humanitarian response often addresses the basic human needs which include safe, sanitary, hazard free environment. From the war torn countries to remote communities, untreated household waste water creates living conditions directly affecting human welfare. We present an IoT enabled, semi-industrial, mobile waste water treatment solution targeted for communities in remote sub-Arctic regions without a centralized sewer system or a waste water treatment facility. The open-source hardware and software platforms were implemented on an Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi to operate a household water reuse system. The water reuse system was developed as part of the Alaska Water and Sewer Challenge to address a cost effective alternative to piped water and sewer service in unserved remote Alaskan Communities. The semi-industrial water treatment system was controlled using the internet enabled Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi components-off-the-shelf (COTS) that allowed for both on-site and remote control. While implemented as a proof-of-concept of a treatment system to evaluate existing waste water technology, the production model can take full advantage of the internet of things concepts that would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, optimized treatment time to meet available community electrical loads, and remote troubleshooting and operation to name a few. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Reliable, accurate, and affordable linear motion control systems for precision agriculture applications are currently not easily accessible due to their elevated cost. Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This paper presents an open-source and low-cost characterization device designed to investigate the behavior of active textiles, which are textiles having the ability to actuate (produce motion/force) and or act as a sensor. Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={We propose a new, fully open-source, low-cost, and small-sized Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) for measuring near-surface water quality in real time in various environments. Existing commercial USVs are expensive and not fully based on open-source hardware, making it difficult to purchase them and to modify their designs and programming to suit various environments. In contrast, the USV platform proposed in this paper is completely open-source, from hardware to software; most parts of the platform can be 3D-printed, and it can be easily modified and upgraded in terms of both design and programming. The platform is equipped with off-the-shelf water sensors for acquiring data like as pH, turbidity, and temperature to measure water quality in real water resources (such as ponds, reservoirs, and lakes). Furthermore, we provide an Android application through which users can easily control the USV via Bluetooth and display the sensor and GPS data the platform generates. We validated the performance of the platform in terms of usability, mobility, and stability through field experiments in various locations, including both the USA and Peru. Moreover, we present a potential application and approach in which this platform can navigate autonomously by utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Bluetooth protocols. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel camera-based approach for parking slot detection with markings, using surround-view cameras mounted on vehicles. By introducing a pipeline of marking-specific image feature extraction and novel filtering stages, we detect parking slot markings in pinhole cameras as well as in cameras with fisheye lenses without using a computationally intensive bird-view transformation. After projecting a compact set of image features into 3D space, our orientation-specific Hough transform finds explicitly the left and right edges of the parking slot markings in desired orientations, which is the basis for marking detection and tracking. We present a novel technique to detect and track the parking slots in the scene in a coherent manner, that preserves the structure of the overall parking layout and its temporal consistency. Our algorithm is designed to run on low cost hardware used in vehicles and it is shown to run at 30fps on ARM CPUs. We validated our algorithm on videos representing real-world scenarios of parking slots including marking occlusion, degradation and different weather conditions. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a feasible and low-cost solution for designing optical-inertial hybrid motion capture systems by integrating two subsystems: The inertial subsystem and the optical subsystem. We calibrate the relative pose of the optical sensor module and the human joint to establish the transformation between the joint parameters and the optical sensor data, so that the data fusion can be performed under the same reference frame. To construct the above motion capture system, an optical-inertial data fusion scheme is proposed, which leverages the optical data of key nodes of the human body to correct the inertial data with accumulated errors. The proposed system can support long-Term drift-free operation with a low-cost hardware setup, avoiding the drift problem of the inertial motion capture system. Simulation experiments have shown that optical data can reduce the drift error to the centimeter level. The practical experiment shows that the virtual character can complete the loop detection after the inertial position is corrected by the optical data. Our motion capture system outputs standard motion capture data, which can be directly imported into engines such as Unity3D and Unreal. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to provide dynamic adaptation of the performance/energy tradeoff, systems today rely on heterogeneous multicore architectures (different micro-architectures on a chip). These systems are limited to single-ISA approaches to enable transparent migration between the different cores. To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software equivalent. The impact on the total execution time of applications and the quality of generated binaries are also measured. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent progress in neuro-prosthetic technology gives rise to the hope that in the future blind people might regain some degree of visual perception. It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to ±70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The most significant determinant of quality of life is sleep quality, with better sleep resulting in a healthier and longer life. Polysomnography, or PSG, is a standardized system to get the medical records from multi-lead ECG recordings. However, PSG is a complicated, expensive and time-consuming procedure. Other alternatives include home sleep centre (HSC) development as a tool for early diagnosis and prevention of sleep disorders while keeping high accuracy. HSC uses low-cost equipment by utilizing single-lead ECG and accompanying applications. ECG is one of the media used in diagnosing and analysis of medical information related to sleep disorders. This study aims to develop a computerized sleep diagnosis application to help experts classify symptoms by investigation and evaluation of QRS morphological, time-frequency characteristics, and nonlinear analysis from single-lead ECG recordings. The classification of non-overlapping of ECG-apnea based non-linear analysis using an ensemble approach. The ensemble learning model approach, using the Boosted Tree test, yielded an accuracy of 94.7%, prediction speed of 120 obs/s and training time of 2.374 s. The QRS morphological characteristic and improved non-overlapping ECG recordings provided satisfactory diagnostic performance in sleep disorder classification for HSC usage. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The majority of bird and bat species are incapable of carrying tags that transmit their position to satellites. Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3° and 6.8°, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Communications and data infrastructures are evolving in the most diverse views, ranging from the processing capacity, passing through wide geographic coverage, and finally to the resiliency and redundancy required in today's applications. However, physical problems such as excessive heat generation and increasing energy consumption continue to be increasingly present. Inspired by the evolution of the concept of Smart grids, we will approach the implementation of an integrated system for monitoring and measuring electricity consumption variables in data centers using open hardware and software libraries based on industry-wide standards such as Ethernet and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Such system is conceived as a basic element for the complete management of a physical Information and Communication Technology infrastructure, since data centers are highly complex elements connected to and representative of Smart grids. For validation, a field-tested hardware and software prototype was developed, one that was capable of performing non-invasive measurements of electric current in data centers and make the data available via network, either in a local infrastructure or in a distributed architecture. Therefore, it could be implemented from small local data centers to huge distributed projects like Smart Grids, securely, inexpensively and highly integrable with other tools and systems. © 2019 IEEE.},

Twelve students (n=12) have been enrolled into the methodology of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to design and implement the mentioned nodes as part of a set of capstone projects. To technical level, each node has been designed using Digital Signal Controllers (dsPICs), the open hardware platform Arduino or FTDI 32-bit microcontrollers as the FT900Q according to the design requirements. Also, it has designed several educational materials in the e-learning tool Xerte and an Algorithm Visualization (AV) tool called DSCBlocks that supported the educational process of the students. The outcomes show that the methodology is suitable to fulfill with the technical and educational requirements of the projects because they enclosed different stages such as problem definition, design strategy, usage of previous knowledge, implementation, debugging and team working.

abstract={The advent of Internet of Things - IoT - technology has elevated the embedded solutions employment to level never seen before, both in the problem-solving possibilities as in the complexity of the new systems. SoC-based computers such as those used in embedded systems have been under growing attention due to their low-cost, low-power, reduced footprint and high performance characteristics. These features allow small users as well as industries to design, develop and build wide range of applications with efficiency as the common aspect. A number of platforms that integrate this kind of technology were also proposed by different manufacturers, some employing the open hardware concept. Embedded applications spread over a wide range of fields, which make them hard to characterize in a general sense. For this reason, benchmark suites are often used as a tool for system's performance evaluation. However, such suites consist on a large number of different algorithms, which can spend time and energy to run on SoC computers. In order to contribute to the performance assessment of such systems, this paper presents a simple method for comparing different platforms, based on execution time of simple but representative algorithms: sorting, cross-correlation and discrete-cosine transform calculation for vectors. The power consumption was also considered. Six distinct architectures were used as a case study. Several computer experiments were conducted in order to make possible a statistic characterization of different load conditions in distinct platforms, so their comparison can be done in a meaningful way. Results show that the proposed method provides a good estimation of relative system performance, which can be useful as a criterion choice for selecting different embedded platforms. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Background/Objectives: This paperproposes a methodfor curtailing the effects of hardware Trojans in cryptographic third-party intellectual property (3PIP) cores without having access to the internal circuitry of the cores. Methods/Statistical analysis: The proposed method obscures inputs to the 3PIP core and detects suspicious outputs thereby preventing the leakage of sensitive information. The proposed hardware architecture consists of XOR gates, multiplexers, and comparators. The hardware architecture was designed using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) and was synthesized using a Virtex4 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. The synthesis was done using Xilinx ISE 14.7 Software which includes ISIM for simulation. Findings: The time-to-market of an electronic product is diminishing due to the competitive nature of the hardware design space. To help cope with the short time-to-market, hardware manufacturing companies tend to integrate 3PIP cores in their designs. The recent surge of hardware Trojans in 3PIP cores make it extremely dangerous to integrate them in designs without thorough evaluation and testing. This is particularly harmful when Trojans in cryptographic 3PIP core leak sensitive information like encryption keys. Most of the proposed methods to detect or prevent the influence of hardware Trojans require a Trojan free model of the Intellectual Property (IP). The main issue with these methods is that many 3PIP cores come as black boxes which prevent designers from having access to the internal workings of the core.This work implements a method that curtails the effects of a hardware Trojan in 3PIP cryptographic cores without having access to the inner working of the design. The synthesis results indicate an area, flip-flop, and Look-up-Table overhead of 7.7%, 10.6%, and 4.6% respectively. Improvements/Applications: The proposed method is applicable to hardware design houses that integrate untrusted 3PIP cores in their designs.Improvingthe resource consumption of the proposed method will be addressed in future works. © 2019 SERSC.},

abstract={Quality assurance detectors comprising cameras and a scintillator volume are of interest for use in spot scanning proton therapy due to its dynamic delivery. In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 ×20× 20 cm)were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV)with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1–1000 ms)using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% ± 0.4% for low SNR (∼20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms)to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future. © 2019},

abstract={A method has been developed for selectively patterning silk surfaces using a photolithographic process to mask off sections of silk films, which allows selective and precise patterning of features down to 40 μm. This process is highly versatile, utilizes only low-cost equipment and can be used to rapidly prototype flat silk substrates with spatially controlled chemical patterns. Here we demonstrate the usefulness of this technique to deposit fluorescent dyes, labeled proteins and conducting polymers or to modify the surface charge of the silk protein in desired regions on a silk film surface.

abstract={Temperature is an important source of information for personal health, weather forecasting, and thermal management in buildings and computing infrastructure, etc. Temperature measurement can be achieved via low-cost hardware with reasonable accuracy. However, large-scale distributed thermal sensing is non-trivial and currently relies on dedicated hardware. In this paper, we design the first software sonic thermometer (SST) using commercial-off-the-shelf acoustic-enabled devices. We utilize on-board dual microphones on commodity mobile devices to estimate sound speed, which has a known relationship with temperature. SST is portable, contactless, and cost-effective, making it suitable for ubiquitous sensing. We implement SST on an Android smart-phone and an acoustic sensing platform. Evaluation results show that SST can achieve a median accuracy of 0.5°Ceven at varying humidity levels. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Recent advances in positional tracking systems for virtual and augmented reality have opened up the possibilities for ubiquitous motion capture technology in the consumer market. However, for many applications such as in performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine, these systems remain too bulky, expensive, and limited to tracking a few objects at a time. In this work, we present a small wireless device that takes advantage of existing HTC Vive lighthouse tracking technology to provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking capabilities. This open hardware and open software project contains several elements, and the latest contributions described in this paper include: (1) a characterization of the optical distortions of the lighthouses, (2) a new cross-platform WebBLE interface, and (3) a real-time in-browser visualization. We also introduce new possibilities with an adaptive calibration to estimate transformation matrices of lighthouses, and an FPGA approach to improve precision and adaptability. Finally, we show how the new developments reduce setup costs and increase the accessibility of our tracking technology. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This work demonstrates an open-source hardware and software platform for monitoring the performance of buildings, called Elemental, that is designed to provide data on indoor environmental quality, energy usage, HVAC operation, and other factors to its users. It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Data collection by conservation biologists is undergoing radical change, with researchers collaborating across disciplines to create bespoke, low-cost monitoring equipment from open-source hardware (OSH). Compared to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs. Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3) lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={The aim of this research is to create fully functional environment for real-life testing of various algorithms in mobile robotic. Main advantage, beside low-cost, is dealing with challenges of real-life implementation. Unlike simulation environments (e.g. MathLab), this setting will allow researchers to test their path planning, collision detection and other algorithms with real challenges, real robots and real static and dynamic obstacles. Environment is particularly adapted for swarm robotics and any other mobile robotics including 2D and 3D scenarios. Enabling researches to prove their algorithms in this environment allows significantly faster path to real implementation in industry, military and science. Concept is based on OpenCV library and low-cost hardware. Solution is based on visual positioning and motion vector detection. System allows controlling mobile robots via radio communication with the range up to 100m which allows practical application of the system.

One of these platforms is represented by Crazyflie 2.0, a nano class quadcopter that was used in research projects that span from control architecture designs to high-level swarm synchronization.This paper presents a study of the control architecture employed in the stock firmware. Based on the mathematical model, the dynamic behaviour is thoroughly evaluated to understand the deviation between ideal and real evolution. A comprehensive phase of parameters tuning is conducted and multiple scenarios for real-time testing are employed. These scenarios comply in tracking predefined patterns, the quadcopter's evolution being tracked via a RGB-D sensor.The proposed evaluation procedure can be easily replicated and represents a very important step in obtaining accurate real-time results. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The posit number system is proposed as a replacement of IEEE floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit system that include performance and resource consumption. To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++ templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of the 'quire', a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of products. The proposed library includes the first open-source parameterized hardware quire. This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still, standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we ensue on the development of a taxonomy aimed at categorizing distractions in the P300b domain. Explicitly, we investigate the effect that auditory distractions, distinctively that of ambient noise (AN), passive talking (PT), and active listening (AL) have on the signal of a visual P300 Speller in terms of accuracy, amplitude, latency, user preference, signal morphology, and overall signal quality. This work is part of a larger EEG based project and is based on the P300 speller BCI (oddball) paradigm and the xDAWN algorithm, with eight healthy subjects; while using a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface based on low fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Our results show that the accuracy was best for the Lab (LC) at 100%, followed by AN at 92.5%, PT at 90% and last AL at 87.5%, which results were in identical order to the subjects' preferences. In addition, the amplitude and latency did not show any statistical significance in all settings. This paper provides additional results that impart insight into the practicability of the aforementioned P300 speller methodology and low-cost equipment to be used in real-world applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The pervasive operation of customer drones, or small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has raised serious concerns about their privacy threats to the public. In recent years, privacy invasion events caused by customer drones have been frequently reported. Given such a fact, timely detection of invading drones has become an emerging task. Existing solutions using active radar, video or acoustic sensors are usually too costly (especially for individuals) or exhibit various constraints (e.g., requiring visual line of sight). Recent research on drone detection with passive RF signals provides an opportunity for low-cost deployment of drone detectors on commodity wireless devices. However, the state of the arts in this direction rely on line-of-sight (LOS) RF signals, which makes them only work under very constrained conditions. The support of more common scenarios, i.e., non-line-of-sight (NLOS), is still missing for low-cost solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel detection system for privacy invasion caused by customer drone. Our system is featured with accurate NLOS detection with low-cost hardware (under 50). By exploring and validating the relationship between drone motions and RF signal under the NLOS condition, we find that RF signatures of drones are somewhat 'amplified' by multipaths in NLOS. Based on this observation, we design a two-step solution which first classifies received RSS measurements into LOS and NLOS categories; deep learning is then used to extract the signatures and ultimately detect the drones. Our experimental results show that LOS and NLOS signals can be identified at accuracy rates of 98.4% and 96% respectively. Our drone detection rate for NLOS condition is above 97% with a system implemented using Raspberry PI 3 B+. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, the researchers have given a low-cost, multiplier-less design with latest DWT (2D lifting technology) for high-speed dual-Z scans. A single dimension parallele row, column processors and five transposing registers are the suggested architecture. Furthermore, a 4N timeline buffer is used to process 2D DWT images with NxN resolution. Flipping architecture is intended to decrease the critical path, replacing multipliers with shifting and adding logic. To reduce transposition and latency buffers, dual Z scanning technology is introduced. The proposed architecture is better for similar performance requirements than the existing hardware architectures. Verilog is defined as the suggested Design Register Transfer Logic (RTL) and is synthesized with Xilinx ISE 14.5. When synthesized with a better hardware efficiency for Xilinx Spartan 6 series field programmable gate array, the suggested architecture works at a frequency of 140.47 MHz. ©BEIESP.},

abstract={Background: The PandaX-4T experiment is a next-generation dark matter search program located in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. To ensure the stability of the complex instrument during the planned operation, the status of the facility should be monitored continuously. Purpose: The paper reports the design of the slow control system for the experiment. The system is used to monitor the facility status and generate an alarm signal while the detector is in abnormal status. Methods: Low-cost hardware is employed for the distributed data collection. Python-based data collection program was developed. We also used the open source software for data storage, visualization and anomaly detection, so that the development of the system is simplified. Conclusion: We finally achieved a low-cost and robust slow control system for the prototype detector in short time. It is running well currently.

abstract={Industry 4.0 paradigm is a reality in the digitization of industrial processes and physical assets, as well as their integration into digital ecosystems with several suppliers of the value chain.

The work reported in this paper focuses on the development of smart devices (SmartBoxes), based on low-cost hardware such as Raspberry Pi and also platforms certified for industrial applications, such as NI CompactRIO. Both platforms adopted the OPC-UA architecture to collect data from the shop-floor and convert it into OPC-UA Data Access standard for further integration in the proposed CPPS. Tests were also performed with the MQTT protocol for monitorization.

abstract={Abstract—: Electro-spark deposition (ESD) has been already recognized as an economically effective surface coating method. It requires a simple and low-cost equipment to run a process. Furthermore, mechanical and tribological properties of the coatings deposited using ESD are very promising, being, in many cases, improved compared to those of a substrate. When coatings are secondary treated via laser beam, they get a smoother surface and an amorphous structure. This paper reviews the investigations conducted on different substrates using different deposition materials via ESD as well as those of mechanical and tribological properties obtained. In particular, the review specifies: the role of ESD in enhancing the metal surface mechanical and tribological characteristics. It seems reasonable to apply ESD wider in order to improve mechanical and tribological properties of metal surfaces. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.},

Open construction systems have emerged as a promising solution to achieve long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In this paper, extensive fieldwork was conducted to investigate a case of an open construction system, namely, the WikiHouse Den Bosch. The research framework builds on a combined view of two main concepts: "conviviality" and "openness". The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two aspects and the literature regarding "Design Global Manufacture Local". The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and context-specific factors. The paper concludes by outlining the need for an "institutionalized conviviality" to open up new pathways for future practice to address sustainability issues. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The use of animal-borne devices in wildlife studies is increasing due to the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs. Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present ‘OpenDropOff’, an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala’s unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid/liquid separator constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The separator-whose performance is competitive with far costlier commercial systems-is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for its firmware. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Firstly, the positioning accuracy of traditional track reckoning is confirmed, and the simulation with carsim simulink is used to verify the track reckoning ability. Secondly, the method of track reckoning with speed is proposed to locate moving vehicle in real time. Finally, due to the inaccurate wheel speed of vehicle at low speed in real vehicle verification section, an improved method of track reckoning used multi-information is proposed. The method combines the advantages of traditional and wheel speed methods of track reckoning to complete the track reckoning better. The software simulations and real vehicle tests about parallel parking trajectory show that the track reckoning with multi-information fusion is superior in Closed- loop update of parking spot. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={During the last decade, many climatic parameters are more and more deviating from the mean values calculated over historical climatic time-series. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest since 1850. According to the preliminary data analysis of the last year, this trend is going to continue in 2018 as well. These climatic changes have accelerated the occurrence of droughts in many parts of the world including Europe and Asia. The North Western region is one such region in Sri Lanka which always affected by droughts due to its inherent dry weather condition. Although drought is considered as a normal part of the climate, its increasing negative impacts on human activities and the environment urges the application of novel technologies in drought monitoring. The 4onse project (analysis of Open, Non-conventional, Sustainable and Effective monitoring systems), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), is a project began in this context to address the aforementioned mentioned issues by deploying 27 open technologies based Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) in Deduru Oya basin of Sri Lanka. These systems measure weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. Thanks to the collected data, it was possible to calculate some drought indexes to evaluate the intensity of the dry periods. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) has been selected as the principal indicator to evaluate droughts by integrating the 4onse data together with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset. © 2019.

abstract={The rapid evolution of intelligent electronic devices makes information technology, computer science and electronics strongly related to the teaching of natural sciences. Today almost everybody has a smart phone that can convert light, temperature, movement, sound to numbers, therefore all these can be processed, analysed, displayed, stored, shared by software applications. The fundamental question is how education can follow this knowledge and how can education take its advantages. Components and methods of modern technology are available for education also, teachers and students can play with parts and tools which were previously used only by engineers. A good example is the very popular Arduino board which is practically an industrial microcontroller whose pins are wired to easy-to-use connectors on a printed circuit board. In this paper we show a universal system which we have developed for the Arduino platform to support experimenting and understanding of the most fundamental principles of the operation of modern devices. We show our related educational concept and discuss the most important features of the system. Open source hardware and software are available and we provide a number of video tutorials as well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors. © 2019, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc.},

abstract={Stochastic computing (SC) is a promising technology that can be used for low-cost hardware designs. However, SC suffers from its long latency. Although parallel processing can efficiently shorten the latency, duplicated stochastic number generators (SNGs) are necessary, which cause substantial hardware overhead. This paper proposes a scalable SNG based on the spin-Hall-effect (SHE), which is capable of generating multiple independent stochastic streams simultaneously. The design takes advantages of the efficient charge-to-spin conversion from the Spin-Hall material and the intrinsic stochasticity of nanomagnets. Compared to previous spintronic SNGs, the SHE-SNG can reduce the area by 1.6×-7.8× and the power by 4.9×-13× while increasing the degree of parallelism from 1 to 16. Compared to CMOS-based SNGs, the proposed SNG obtained 24×-120× and 53× reduction in terms of area and power, respectively. Finally, three benchmarks were implemented, and the results indicate that SC implementations with the proposed SHE-SNG can achieve 1.2×-29× reduction of hardware resources compared to implementations with previous CMOS-and spintronic-based designs while scaling the degree of parallelism from 1 to 64. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={At present, various existing IoT (Internet of Things, IoT) comprehensive experimental platforms customized experimental toolboxes for specific goals. Therefore, they lack flexibility and scalability and applications are difficult to integrate with each other, which cannot meet the needs of new IoT application development. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an IoT comprehensive experiment and application development platform based on open source ecosystem, which provides support for IoT research, application development and teaching. Compared with traditional platforms, this platform has the end-To-end capabilities of the IoT architecture which is from device layer, transport layer to data processing and application development layer. This comprehensive experimental platform based on open source hardware and IoT middleware provides access for multiple heterogeneous devices and provides a semi-Automated physical entity and virtual resource mapping framework. The publish/subscribe model is used for providing data publishing and device management function and loosely coupled integration with multiple cloud platforms. This kind of IoT platform based on open source ecosystem reduces system development cost, improves system flexibility, and meets the diverse needs of practical experimental teaching. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Usage of low-cost hardware in large antenna arrays and low-power wireless devices in Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the degradation of practical beamforming gains due to the underlying hardware impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI). To address this timely concern, we present a new nontrivial closed-form expression for the globally optimal least squares estimator (LSE) for the IQI-influenced channel between a multiantenna transmitter and single-Antenna IoT device. Thereafter, to maximize the realistic transmit beamforming gains, a novel precoder design is derived that accounts for the underlying IQI for maximizing received power in both single and multiuser settings. Finally, the simulation results, demonstrating a significant $-{\text{8}}dB improvement in the mean squared error of the proposed LSE over existing benchmarks, show that the optimal precoder designing is more critical than accurately estimating IQI-impaired channels. Also, the proposed jointly optimal LSE and beamformer outperforms the existing designs by providing ${\text{24}{\%}}enhancement in mean signal power received under IQI. © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Habitat spatial structure has a profound influence on bacterial life, yet there currently are no low-cost equipment-free laboratory techniques to reproduce the intricate structure of natural bacterial habitats. Here, we demonstrate the use of paper scaffolds to create landscapes spatially structured at the scales relevant to bacterial ecology. In paper scaffolds, planktonic bacteria migrate through liquid-filled pores, while the paper’s cellulose fibres serve as anchor points for sessile colonies (biofilms). Using this novel approach, we explore bacterial colonisation dynamics in different landscape topographies and characterise the community composition of Escherichia coli strains undergoing centimetre-scale range expansions in habitats structured at the micrometre scale. The bacteria-in-paper platform enables quantitative assessment of bacterial community dynamics in complex environments using everyday materials. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Most blood cells exhibit a natural deformation capability. Specifically, red blood cells (RBCs) are characterized by their great ability to deform and squeeze through microcapillary vessels, even with strict restrictions, recovering their shape after crossing them. That capability can be affected by various blood diseases (malaria, diabetes, etc), turning the cells into more rigid, and, as a result, it can generate blood flow disorders in the microcirculatory system. In this work, we propose a new micro-device to study the cell deformability consisting of a simple borosilicate micronozzle whose production is straightforward, fast, and uses low-cost equipment, when compared with other similar microfluidic devices found in the literature. We checked that the optical distortion coming from the glass is negligible when the micronozzle was submerged in a bath of glycerol, being able to perform blood flow visualizations through the micronozzle by using a high-speed video microscopy system. The shape of the converging area of our micronozzles produced an extensional flow. This type of flow is proper to conduct cell deformability assessments. After the characterization of our micro-device, we applied it to obtain the deformation index (DI) of both healthy and chemically treated human RBCs for several sections of our micronozzles. As expected, the experimental results show that the DI of healthy RBCs is much higher than the corresponding for more rigid (chemically treated) ones. These measurements show that the borosilicate nozzles allow to detect changes in the cellular mechanical properties similar to those produced by blood diseases, and suggest that, this microfluidic device could be easily transformed into a clinical tool for detection of blood diseases. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the era of technological advances and innovations in transportation technologies, application of driving simulators for the investigation and assessment of the driving process provides a safe and suitable testing environment. Although driving simulators are crucial for further improvements in transportation, it is important to resolve one of their main disadvantages–simulator sickness. Therefore, suitable methods for the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity–electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are growing simultaneously. These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO2 and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user’s state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via ‘HTTP requests’ for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO2 and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001% which proves its applicability in healthcare. © 2019 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.},

abstract={With the growing complexity of current mechatronics systems, their verification is getting more important, hard, time-consuming and expensive. Hardware-in-the-loop systems (HIL) provide an opportunity for simulation very similar to real life. The problem, aside from performance, is that they are complex, hardly integratable and thus hardly plannable and expensive. This paper proposes an approach for automation of the process of HIL system configuration, but also development based on low-cost hardware. It provides a full system solution, starting with hardware platform and architecture up to firmware development, code generation and integration of the HIL system. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The paper describes the possibilities of data acquisition and data processing from optical sensing systems. There are some data acquisition cards and their disadvantages when used for more complex single fiber sensor systems in the paper. It is suitable to use some open source hardware because commercially available data acquisition cards are more complex and universal which means they have several different inputs/outputs and large dimensions. STEMLab 125-14 (Red Pitaya) appears to be the most suitable solution because offers 2 analog inputs and 2 analog outputs. Compare to standard data processing systems, this is supposed to be an advantage in preprocessing data using programmable logic. This can reduce the volume of transmitted data and can also speed up processing. Thus, the measurement system will be smaller and cheaper. The device contains DA converters, therefore pulses might be generated using the same clock which enables synchronization of backscatter signal. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, the authors design a wearable gesture recognition system that identifies the alphabetic gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) efficiently, requiring minimal user calibration. The system uses a heterogeneous collection of sensors, viz., contact, flex and inertial, placed strategically on the hand to record movements and points of contact involved during gesture signing. In order to minimize user calibration, the authors propose a novel approach called as State-based gesture modelling, which requires only 7 gestures to be signed by a user to create a State-based model for all 26 alphabetic gestures in ASL for that user. A multi-stage gesture recognition algorithm, which uses the user-calibrated State-based model, is employed for gesture identification. The system was extensively tested for 2 trained and 1 amateur ASL signers for up to 150 times per gesture giving maximum efficiencies of 92% and 81% respectively, thus indicating the robustness of the system. The use of an elegant algorithm along with simple off-The-shelf sensors enabled the implementation of the entire system on an ATmega 328P micro-controller, resulting in a cost of 25 USD for a laboratory stage prototype. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Geospatial Data Warehouse (GDW) is a repository of historical and geospatial data used in the decision-making process. This kind of system manages large volumes of data and supports Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) queries. The use of NoSQL databases in the construction of GDW is still an unexplored topic, even though NoSQL databases present good performance and high scalability with low-cost hardware. In this context, we seek to identify the level of redundancy of geospatial data in Document-Oriented GDW (DGDW) that reduces the storage cost and increases the performance of SOLAP queries. Using the MongoDB database, we exhaustively define and investigate nine DGDW schemas, which have different levels of geospatial data redundancy in their dimensions. We performed an experimental evaluation of these schemas in a cluster structure, to analyze the data volume and the runtime of seven queries which simulate SOLAP operations in geospatial fields with different levels of redundancy and selectivity. Our experimental results indicate that the normalization of low-selectivity geospatial fields and the denormalization of high-selectivity geospatial fields are good strategies to reduce the storage cost and improve the performance of SOLAP queries. The results of our experimental evaluation are an important contribution because they can be used as a guide for construction of DGDW. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper revisits the problem of synthesizing the optimal control law for linear time-varying systems by using the global optimal control framework introduced by Vadim Krotov. This approach is based on the idea of total decomposition of the original optimal control problem (OCP) with respect to time thereby providing sufficient conditions for the existence of global solution based on another optimization problem, which turns out to be nonlinear and non-convex, and is completely equivalent to the original OCP. The solution of this equivalent optimization problem is usually computed using iterative methods which may not be desirable for deploying low-cost hardware in industry. In this paper, we propose a novel method for synthesizing the global optimal control law using these sufficient conditions. The novelty of the proposed method lies in transforming the equivalent non-convex optimization problem into a convex problem by a judicious choice of the so-called Krotov functions. As an immediate consequence, there is no need to compute an iterative solution. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract={Two main bottlenecks encountered when implementing energy-efficient spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) based sparse coding, are the complex computation of winner-take-all (WTA) operation and repetitive neuronal operations in the time domain processing. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient STDP based sparse coding processor. The low-cost hardware is based on algorithmic reduction techniques as following: First, the complex WTA operation is simplified based on the prediction of spike emitting neurons. Sparsity based approximation in spatial and temporal domain are also efficiently exploited to remove the redundant neurons with negligible algorithmic accuracy loss. We designed and implemented the hardware of the STDP based sparse coding using 65nm CMOS process. By exploiting input sparsity, the proposed architecture can dynamically trade off computation energy (up to 74%) with algorithmic quality for Natural image (maximum 3.55% quality loss) and MNIST (no quality loss) applications. In the inference mode of operations, the SNN hardware achieves the throughput of 374Mpixels/s and 840.2GSOP/s with energy-efficiency of 781.52pJ/pixel and 0.35pJ/SOP. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The tremendous growth in the wireless communication system demands a very high-speed data transmission with better quality of service. The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) provides high-speed data communications by utilizing the spectrum more significantly than other approaches including Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). Most of the OFDM transceiver architectures with different algorithms for wireless communication are conventionally used along with software-based approaches which are not suitable for real-time scenarios in Radio Frequency (RF) systems. There is no complete standard benchmark or prototyped hardware architecture for OFDM based RF systems. Very few existing designs are available with hardware overhead issues. In this paper, the proposed OFDM system offers low cost hardware architecture which includes Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) modulation-demodulation, highly pipelined Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) modeling along with digital conversion systems like Direct Up-Conversion (DUC) and Direct-Down-Conversion (DDC), which supports the RF systems for real-time requirements. The proposed OFDM systems support both data and image for transmission. The design is synthesized in Xilinx platform and simulated using Model-sim and prototyped on Artix 7 FPGA board. The proposed OFDM system is compared with existing similar architecture on the same FPGA device with hardware constraints improvements. © 2019 Int. J. Elec. & Elecn. Eng. & Telcomm.},

abstract={We propose a set of theoretical and practical tools for the stabilization of dc networks. In order to do so, we propose a new framework to study the dynamics of dc grids - one that permits the combination of power converter models with those impedances - directly in higher-order terms. This mathematical setting includes a convenient modeling specification that allows one to analyze complex high-gain converter topologies and to develop an energy-based stability analysis for dc grids with potential destabilizers such as loads with negative impedance characteristics (e.g., constant power loads). We show that instability problems arise due to a power imbalance between passive and non-passive loads, hence power balancing is a suitable stabilizing mechanism. Moreover, a low-cost hardware solution that ensures stability is provided in the form of a lossless (H-bridge) stabilizing filter. The new theoretical results, combined with the proposed implementation, offer a low-cost alternative with respect to other (battery/super-capacitor) energy-storage-based existing strategies. Experimental results based on a high voltage gain quadratic converter feeding multiple non-passive loads are included. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper provides the design of a novel open-hardware mini-bipedal robot, named Rapid-Prototyped Remote-Brain BiPed (RPBP), that is developed to provide a low-cost and reliable platform for locomotion and perception research. The robot is made of customized 3D-printed material (ABS plastic) and electronics, and commercial Robotics Dynamixel MX-28 actuators, as well as visual RGB-D and IMU sensing systems. We show that the robot is able to perform some locomotion/visual-odometry tasks and it is easy to switch between different feet designs, providing also a novel Center-of-Pressure (CoP) sensing system, so that it can deal with various types of terrain. Moreover, we provide a description of its control and perception system architecture, as well as our opensource software packages that provide sensing and navigation tools for locomotion and visual odometry on the robot. Finally, we briefly discuss the transferability of some prototype research that has been done on the developed mini-biped, to half or fullsize humanoid robots, such as COMAN or WALK-MAN. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the advantages of computer network have attracted the attention of technological experts. However, network security issues remain a challenge. Controlling Web traffic and preventing attack to Web server, especially DoS/DDoS, are tremendous in the current computing ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a solution for controlling connections of the inside as well as the outside of network systems by using an integrated hardware, which would be deployed at gateway of the networks. It is not only used to implement rules but also monitor the network traffic, especially for web traffic which is considered as the common type in the Internet. In our solution, we prefer to use the IP SLA to control the web traffic, rather proxy to set up rules as well as a data stream algorithm for fast detecting Hot-IPs to prevent attacks from outside networks to the inside servers. The proposed solution is trouble-free to use and enhance security in small medium networks as well. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={It is well established that the utilization of unused millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum is inevitable due to unavailability of required bandwidth in the conventional RF band to support the high data demands of 5G. Large antenna arrays with beamforming capabilities are required to compensate for the high path loss at mmWave frequencies. We are at the verge of a massive mmWave radio front-end deployment, and low-complexity low-cost hardware beamforming solutions are required now at this stage than ever before. In this paper, one such solution is demonstrated and analyzed. A high-performance and low-complexity lens-based beamformer consisting of constant dielectric material ( \epsilon -{r} ) with antenna feeds is presented for multibeam operation. A prototype is developed based on the classical synthesis approach, and in line with the requirements of mmWave hybrid multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. A characterization at 28 GHz is performed wherein an uplink signal-to-noise ratio of user terminals is evaluated with the zero-forcing (ZF) baseband signal processing. Radiation performance of a single-source beamformer is measured in an anechoic environment, and end-to-end ergodic sum spectral efficiency performance is estimated based on the measured data. It is shown that the constant- \epsilon -{r} -based beamformer solution is simple, yet significantly outperforms conventional antenna array beamformers with analog phase shifter networks, making it a promising candidate for future hybrid massive MIMO systems. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A key assumption conventionally made by flexible head-mounted eye-tracking systems is often invalid: The eye center does not remain stationary w.r.t. the eye camera due to slippage. For instance, eye-tracker slippage might happen due to head acceleration or explicit adjustments by the user. As a result, gaze estimation accuracy can be significantly reduced. In this work, we propose Grip, a novel gaze estimation method capable of instantaneously compensating for eye-tracker slippage without additional hardware requirements such as glints or stereo eye camera setups. Grip was evaluated using previously collected data from a large scale unconstrained pervasive eye-tracking study. Our results indicate significant slippage compensation potential, decreasing average participant median angular offset by more than 43% w.r.t. a non-slippage-robust gaze estimation method. A reference implementation of Grip was integrated into EyeRecToo, an open-source hardware-agnostic eye-tracking software, thus making it readily accessible for multiple eye trackers (Available at: www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/perception). © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In Earth science, we must often collect data from sensors installed in remote locations. Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY’s Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries’ open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer. © 2019 DeBell, Goertzen, Larson, Selbie, Selker and Udell.},

abstract={Control system design and validation can be a frustrating experience for many students. These students benefit from the inclusion of a laboratory component that provides a hands-on experience to complement lecture. However, physical space and funding for educational labs are always competitive. One solution is the use of low-cost take-home kits that allow students to design and validate feedback controllers outside of the confines of a physical laboratory space. Currently, take-home kits are often used for simpler tasks, such as controlling LEDs and motors, and do not extend to feedback control of classical control experiments, such as the inverted pendulum. Inspired by industrial controller design techniques, a low-cost take-home kit was developed to act as a Hardware-in-Loop tester for the inverted pendulum experiment. The resulting low-cost Hardware-in-Loop tester is validated against a real inverted pendulum to demonstrate performance. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

abstract={This Complete Evidence-based Practice paper outlines the benefits of incorporating Arduino activities into a first-year engineering class for students majoring in electrical engineering, bioengineering, undeclared engineering and mechanical engineering at Fairfield University. Arduino is an open-source hardware platform that has recently gained a wide following among students for its ease of utilization to build with it exciting interactive projects. Teaching first-year engineering classes is a challenge given the importance of these classes in providing a solid foundation in engineering education. The traditional highly demanding first-year engineering curriculum which focuses primarily on engineering thinking and problem solving with a limited content of basic skills is not inspiring to incoming students and can become overwhelming. For this reason, we will use the Arduino platform in this first-year engineering class to add more hands-on activities to the curriculum and bring the joy of achievement for students. Our goal is to add excitement to the Fundamentals of Engineering course by providing a hands-on and fun-to-learn environment designed to expose students to tools that will lead them to critical thinking, innovation, energy awareness, and problem-solving skills which will enable them to become part of a very competitive workforce in the future. Project-based courses attempt to resolve the tension between providing training in the fundamentals of engineering and problem solving by motivating and engaging students. Active learning in first year engineering courses is believed to improve retention and appeal to a diverse population of students [1]. We report on a two-year study using the Arduino platform to build a series of projects. We have used Arduino platform projects in two-course instances and present survey results describing student responses to learning with Arduino. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.},

abstract={This paper shares nascent research on the organizing practices of feminist technology activists and open science hardware (OSH) developers who are concerned with how technologies (and subsequent knowledges about them) are defined, framed, further developed, shared, and in turn shape the worlds in which we live. They intend to bring a frame of reflexivity toward awareness of the politics imbued in technology as well as the often exclusionary cultures entangled therein. Further this research brings field work observations of these groups and their practices (designated as Study 1) into conversation with interviews of engineering education researchers (designated as Study 2). In that vein, this examination asks: What might an analysis of the practices and mindsets of feminist hacker and opensource science hardware groups contribute to the world of engineering education, specifically for educators interested in change-making strategies for creating a more equitable higher education environment that takes on issues of racism, sexism, heteronormativity, ableism, etc.? With a theoretical grounding in the work of Myles Horton and the Highlander Research and Education Center's theory of change, bell hooks' liberatory pedagogies, and social movement theory from a science and technology studies (STS) perspective, this paper aims to examine how current social movements in technology, specifically the organizing work of feminist hacker and tech collectives as well as those working with opensource science hardware, might inform changes to engineering practice via educational reform. Data collection for this work involves participant observation from four different meetings and discursive analysis of websites and promotional materials. The result is a multi-modal analysis which will then be brought into conversation with previous work on 32 interviews with engineering education practitioners who have identified issues in the discipline and are interested in enacting change in the higher institutional setting. Such work has implications for engineering education reform and organizing possibilities toward enabling educators to seed the changes they seek. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

abstract={Cybersecurity continues to be a growing priority for organizations of all sizes and industries. The threat landscape continues to rapidly evolve producing disastrous cyber attacks that are crippling their targets and debilitating the economy. These attacks continue to increase in frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity of impact. New attack vectors are persistently emerging and new exploit techniques are constantly gaining widespread adoption. Small businesses continue to experience lack of adequate solutions and resources to defend against and repel these attacks. We present a holistic open source software and hardware solution, that successfully implements securing the network architecture by using the “defense-in-depth” approach that ensures the elimination of single or dual point of potential vulnerability within a network. The Protectli FW108120 firewall, referred to as “The Vault” is used as first line of defense. It is a low power, fanless, durable, customizable small form factor PC. It utilizes a Celeron J1900 processor, 8 GB of DDR3 memory, a 120 GB mSATA SSD, and 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports. The community version of pfSense firewall will be utilized to run on the firewall. pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router, based on FreeBSD, that also features unified threat management (UTM), load balancing, and multi zone setup. pfSense implements, maintains, and polices our multi-zone topology, which is formed of a DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ), a trusted zone, and an untrusted zone. The DMZ achieves defense in depth by adding an extra layer of security beyond that of a single perimeter, separating an external network from directly referencing an internal network, and isolating a particular machine within a network. Thought the DMZ concept is not new, implementing it using stacked Single-Board Computers (SBC), offers an affordable and flexible, yet secure, network architecture specifically for startups, small businesses, an expansion office, or even home office. The selected single board computers are a combination of third generation Raspberry Pis and Rock64s. These boards provide a remarkable computational power, low energy consumption, light weight, a compact size secure solution, and resourceful community support. These boards will form the DMZ network servers and host services such as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, a selection of honeypots for Secure Shell (SSH), web applications, packet sniffing, private web browsing capabilities via TOR (The Onion Router), LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python or Perl) server, Virtual Private Network (VPN) server, and protected browsing via proxy service. The main goal of this educational project is to leverage the total holistic integration of open source hardware and software to provide an affordable and portable solution that could be promptly deployed in case of an emergency, as a part of an incident response plan (IRP), or in case it is needed for testing purposes. Implementing this project provides valuable hands-on security experience and best practices in network architecture and configuration. Additional security features, both in hardware and software, were added to the single-board computers to add additional hardened security layers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.},

abstract={Organic dye detection requires high sensitivity, low-cost equipment, simplified procedures, and real-time capabilities; thus, electrochemical methods are gradually emerging in this field instead of chromatography. However, much attention has been paid to toxic and complex metal or noble-metal hybrid materials for constructing electrochemical sensors, which is extremely limiting for practical applications. In this study, a metal-free electrocatalyst, MWNTs with carboxylic groups (MWNTs-COOH), was prepared through surface oxidation in a piranha solution and a simple hydrothermal treatment. The obtained MWNTs-COOH possessed superior hydrophilicity, increased conductivity and substantial active carbon or carboxylic group sites, as determined by characterization using Raman spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, electrochemical surface area analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The above advantages enabled MWNTs-COOH to exhibit excellent electrochemical activities, with a satisfactory utilization for determining trace Rhodamine B (RhB), showing a lower calculated detection limitation of 2.66 nM and a wider linear range from 0.05 to 850 μM with outstanding specificity and reproducibility. Furthermore, it was found that the carboxyl group on the MWNTs would probably have triggered the electron redistribution and exposed more adjacent active carbon sites, which facilitate the electrocatalytic function to CN on the RhB directly. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Human visual attention performs the spatio-temporal regularity, an inherent regularity in dynamic vision, for the natural visual tasks. However, recent computational visual attention models still have deficiency to reflect the spatio-temporal regularity thoroughly. Motivated by this, we propose a bio-inspired motion sensitive model to estimate human gaze positions in driving. The proposed model has four key advantages. First, inspired by two types of motion sensitive neurons, this model can perceive the motion cues from different directions spatially and temporally. Second, compared to conventional deep learning based models, this model does not rely on expensive training samples with gaze annotations. Third, the proposed model is based upon the visual signal processing without constructing a complex deep neural network architecture, which enables this model to be implemented with low-cost hardware. Fourth, inspired by the visual pathway in drosophila motion vision, the visual signal processing on directional and depth motion sensitive map largely enhances this model's competence in a similar way of human gaze positions in driving. To test this proposed model, we collect a driving scene dataset from the perspective of egocentric vision that aims to systematically evaluate the performance of spatio-temporal visual attentional models. The video clips in the dataset are categorized into ten popular driving conditions. The proposed model is evaluated by comparing with the human baseline of the gaze positions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively estimate the human gaze positions in driving and consistently outperforms traditional visual attention models as well as the deep learning based model. © 2019},

Even though the designs of OSH are freely and openly available over the internet, in most cases, building or assembling science equipment from online designs require knowledge and skills in areas such as digital fabrication and basic electronics. Due to this, some open science practitioners face a multitude of challenges when replicating or customizing those designs to be used in their science experiments.To this end, through ethnographic field work and participatory design, my doctoral research explores such practical challenges faced by open science practitioners and tries to create new mediums and workflows to support efficient and inclusive dissemination of OSH. © 2019 Author.},

abstract={We present the developmental considerations, design, and deployment of an autonomous modular terrestrial rover for ice-sheet exploration that is inexpensive, easy to construct, and allows for instrumentation customization. The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD&thinsp;3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory platform that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions. © Author(s) 2019.},

This paper proposes a possible implementation of a BF16 multiply-accumulation operation that relaxes several IEEE Floating-Point Standard features to afford low-cost hardware implementations. Specifically, subnorms are flushed to zero; only one non-standard rounding mode (Round-Odd) is supported; NaNs are not propagated; and IEEE exception flags are not provided. The paper shows that this approach achieves the same network-level accuracy as using IEEE single-precision arithmetic ('FP32') for less than half the datapath area cost and with greater throughput. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) has been increasing recently owing to its flexibility in allowing an efficient and economical approach to promote real-time emulation. In the field of power electronics, HIL can be a useful solution since it allows testing control techniques in real controller devices without running the risk of damaging expensive components. However, real-time emulation requires powerful hardware to be performed, which has the drawback of increasing the HIL implementation's cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-cost HIL implementation for real-time emulation and control of a boost converter that uses the STM32 high-performance microcontroller unit (MCU). Stand-alone simulation on PSIM software and validation using an experimental boost converter are executed. © 2019 EUCA.},

abstract={Advances in semiconductor miniaturization are an important driver for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since their invention in the 1980s. The increasing number of available on chip logic resources on one hand and on the other hand a decrease in part costs let the FPGA market grow steadily in recent years. It comes thus at no surprise that more and more microprocessors are integrated into programmable logic devices as they represent the central functionality in many digital systems. In parallel to these technological developments the open-source hardware community grew steadily in the last two decades. More than hundred open-source CPU cores can thus be found and selecting a core for a design project has to be done with care. In this work we thus want to focus on open-source 32-bit CPU IP cores suitable for FPGAs and which support the upcoming free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture that has some interesting advantages when compared to commercial CPU cores (as will be outlined in the paper). An overview on available projects and activities will be given and evaluation results for a selection of cores will be presented. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The measurement of geometric deviations within large-size products is a challenging topic. One of the most applied technique compares the nominal product with the digitalization of real product obtained by a reverse engineering process. Digitalization of big geometric models is usually performed by means of multiple acquisitions from different scanning locations. Therefore, digitalization needs to correctly place the acquired point clouds in 3D digital environment. For this purpose, it is very important identifying the exact scanning location in order to correctly realign point clouds and generate an accurate 3D CAD model.The present paper faces the locating problem of a handling device for reverse engineering scanning systems.

The proposed application of this robot is to obtain a labelled 2D map of an unknown static indoor environment using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm, for creation of a map and also for object-detection in it. The objects would then be appropriately labelled. The end result is a 2D map of the environment, with labelled objects. The SLAM algorithm is implemented using the open-source Gmapping package, which is integrated into the ROS Framework. Besides, it is also used alongside the RViz Visualization tool for viewing the maps created. By employing low-cost hardware, the cost of building such a platform has been made quite economical while retaining the precision of the map obtained.

abstract={Localization of eddy current probes in Nondestructive Testing allows merging the defect detection with the information about defect positions. Typically, this task requires the usage of additional and costly position measurement systems or software assisted handlers in controlled laboratory conditions. However, many of these tests require free hand movements of the eddy current probes. In addition, in many industrial applications low cost is a stringent requirement. This paper proposes a novel solution to address the considered issues. In particular, the paper describes the usage of a magnetic 2D wireless localization method, able to track the probe position during the execution of Nondestructive Tests. To the best of our knowledge, such approach is novel and promises to provide localization information in Nondestructive Testing by means of low-cost hardware. Moreover, it is characterized by a light computational burden, since it reuses most of the equipment already needed for the test itself. Preliminary results, proving the suitability of a real time simultaneous testing and localization system, are reported in this paper. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The prevalence of wireless networks has made the long-Term need for communications security more imperative. In various wireless applications, images and/or video constitute critical data for transmission. For their copyright protection and authentication, watermarking can be used. In many cases, the cost of wireless nodes must be kept low, which means that their processing and/or power capabilities are very limited. In such cases, low-cost hardware implementations of digital image/video watermarking techniques are necessary. However, to end up with such implementations, proper selection of watermarking techniques is not enough. For this reason, in this paper, we introduce computation optimizations of the implemented algorithm to keep the integer part of arithmetic operations at optimal size, and, hence, arithmetic units as small as possible. In addition, further analysis is performed to reduce quantization error. Three different hardware-Architecture variants, two for image watermarking and one for video (pipelined), are proposed, which reutilize the already small arithmetic units in different computation steps, to further reduce implementation cost. The proposed designs compare favorably to already existing implementations in terms of area, power, and performance. Moreover, the watermarked images'/frames' errors, compared to their floating point counterparts, are very small, while robustness to various attacks is high. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

DAA (Detect and Avoid) is a new technology necessary for UASs to safely avoid obstacles or other aircrafts. In this paper low-cost sensors, such as a 10-DOF (Degree Of Freedom) MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical System) IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and a LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), synchronized at 10-Hz measurement rate, were installed on a small unmanned rotorcraft to estimate the position of the platform and its distance from an obstacle or a landing field. To correct the IMU data from systematics errors (bias) and measurement noise, and to derive estimated positions from accelerometer data, Kalman filtering was implemented. The optimal estimation algorithm, developed on an onboard microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560), allows for low-cost hardware implementations of multiple sensors for use in aerospace applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In today's world of computation, data compression takes vigorous part in most of the real–time and embedded system applications. Some of such end uses are essentially derived for specific task, however their realization are not described and delineated. To bridge this variance, an attempt is made to experimentally present an evidence behind usage of vector quantization levels of 50 in popular digital cameras, generating other vector quantization levels. This has been incorporated to reduce the trade–off between quality and size of reconstructed images by the use of vector quantization levels less than quantization level of 50. The prime objective of the work encompasses the generation of vector quantization levels from 10 to 75 for digital cameras in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based image compression and analyzing the performance of proposed algorithm efficiency through parameters such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Compression Ratio (CR), Bits per Pixel (bpp) and percentage Space Saving by applying it to standard test images. In this exploration, vector quantization level of four digital cameras namely Canon PowerShot A700 (Superfine), Fuji FinePix A700 (Fine), Nikon CoolPix P5000 (Fine) and Sony Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) A700 (Fine) have been used.

abstract={Wireless sensor network (WSN) applications have expanded considerably over the past decade or so and now, solutions exit for various innovative applications. These wireless networks adopt commercial off the shelf devices and standardized protocols, which inherently creates security challenges. These challenges are ever changing as malicious interference and intrusion techniques evolve and dynamic efficient hardware becomes increasingly accessible. This paper presents the development of multiple low-cost hardware and software platforms designed so security enhancements and modifications to WSN protocol architecture and packet structure can be designed and tested. Each testbed has been built satisfying the requirements of being available as unmodified commercial off the shelf (COTS) components and based on open source software. The testbeds provide versatility through operating on various operating systems including Windows and Linux, are reproducible and can be deployed in a way which replicates real world WSNs. Each distinct system provides remote access, real time and off line data analysis, specific control of each network node and the ability to upload data from the WSN. This paper describes in-detail the individual pieces of suitable hardware for WSN protocol and packet structure design and illustrates the system architecture required to form testbeds which can experimentally validate modifications to a WSN protocol. Additionally, a baseline is defined and encapsulates the ZigBee standard. Example results of the distinct testbeds in operation are provided along with the specific open source software being used. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Visible Light Communication (VLC) paradigm allows the reusing of existing illuminating infrastructures in order to provide data communication. VLC can be considered a promising technology also for positioning in indoor environments, due to its potentially high accuracy and low costs. However, the main obstacle to the use of VLC for localization purposes is the high level of environmental noises, mainly due to sunlight. A novel approach, for easily measuring environmental noises and compensating their effects on localization results performed by an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) based on VLC, is proposed in this work. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is adopted to divide the total bandwidth into a series of non-overlapping frequency sub-bands corresponding to each signal, while an estimation of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), obtained through real time Power Spectral Density measurements in the proper frequency ranges, is exploited to compensate the error in positioning due to sunlight and other wide-band external optical disturbing signals. The proposed approach has been validated through experimental tests, carried out using a simple deployment of low power lamps, low cost hardware and a software defined approach. In the region under test, receiver position has been experimentally detected with higher accuracy in comparison to classical FDM approach, confirming the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed technique. In order to further validate the proposed approach, an additive measurement campaign has been successfully carried out considering a scenario characterized by very low SNR levels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objectives: Changes in pupil size are governed by the autonomic nervous system but may be systematically driven by voluntary shifting the gaze in depth. Thus, the pupil accommodative response (PAR) that accompanies voluntary gaze shifts from a far to a near target might be exploited as a simple human-computer interface (HCI), bypassing the somato-motor system. Here we aim to characterize PAR in quasi-natural conditions with low-cost equipment and test the possibility to use PAR as a binary communication tool. Methods: Nineteen healthy subjects were instructed to voluntary switch the focus from a far to a near target upon presentation of an auditory cue. Three protocols addressed the effects of monocular/binocular vision, eye illuminance, duration of near vision, target texture and target brightness on PAR features. In a fourth protocol PAR was used to establish binary communication at different bit rates. Results: PAR amplitude decreased with increasing eye illuminance and was modulated by monocular/binocular vision, duration of near vision or target texture. PAR amplitude was larger with a bright near target and a dark far target than vice-versa. However, PAR was always clearly present, regardless of the experimental manipulations. PAR-based communication performance achieved an accuracy of 100% at 10 bits/min and 96% at 15 bits/min. Significance: Voluntary PAR is a robust signal, and can achieve a high communication speed when used as an HCI. This study provides a proof of concept for a PAR-based HCI, potentially useful to communicate with locked-in patients with preserved visual and autonomic functions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The aging of insulation materials in GIS leads to a series of electrical problems. As a fully enclosed device, GIS faces extremely complex repairing problems once an accident occurs comparing with the separated open equipment. The root cause of this problem is multifaceted, including not only the high voltage issues, but also the environmental factors in operation such as temperature, mechanical vibration, etc. All these lead to the aging of insulation materials and the failure of the equipment. Therefore, it is important to analyze the aging state of the GIS spacer, especially the GIS spacers in service. In this paper, to evaluate the aging state of the GIS spacer in service, the structural properties, as well as electrical performance of insulating material obtained from a GIS spacer served more than 15 years are characterized and compared with that of a new GIS spacer. To investigate the change in electrical properties, dielectric loss test, polarization current, surface resistance, and partial discharge measurement are delivered. And thermal characterizations including DSC, TGA and IR are also delivered to investigate the structure change of the insulation epoxy. The results show that the aging effect reduces the surface resistances and increases the dielectric loss, polarization current and partial discharge. And with the service time increases, the glass transition temperature and the thermal decomposition temperature of the GIS spacer declines. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of unmanned aquatic surface vehicles as a tool for exploring and inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a third method that allows the robot's full software system including real world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal (applied force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water. Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The modulation of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) by a pre-stimulus called pre-pulse inhibition (PPI, for gap of silence pre-stimulus: GPIAS) is a versatile tool to, e.g., estimate hearing thresholds or identify subjective tinnitus percepts in rodents. A proper application of these paradigms depends on a reliable measurement of the ASR amplitudes and an exact stimulus presentation in terms of frequency and intensity. Here, we introduce a novel open-source solution for the construction of a low-cost ASR setup. The complete software for data acquisition and stimulus presentation is written in Python 3.6 and is provided as an Anaconda package. Furthermore, we provide a construction plan for the sensor system based on low-cost hardware components. Exemplary GPIAS data from two animal models (Mus musculus, Meriones unguiculatus) show that the ratio histograms (1-GPIAS) of the gap-pre-stimulus and no pre-stimulus ASR amplitudes can be well described by a log-normal distribution being in good accordance to previous studies with already established setups. Furthermore, it can be shown that the PPI as a function of pre-stimulus intensity (threshold paradigm) can be approximated with a hard-sigmoid function enabling a reproducible sensory threshold estimation. Thus, we show that the open-source solution could help to further establish the ASR method in many laboratories and, thus, facilitate and standardize research in animal models of tinnitus and/or hearing loss. © 2019 Gerum, Rahlfs, Streb, Krauss, Grimm, Metzner, Tziridis, Günther, Schulze, Kellermann and Schilling.},

abstract={Understanding the neural correlates of sensory processing such as touch and temperature sensation is important for basic and clinical neuroscience. In addition, to preserve perceptive functions such as touch, which has a critical role in the regulation of the movement, mapping the somatosensory cortex is critical in surgeries involving tumor and epileptogenic zone resection. Novel and low cost hardware solutions are needed that can help clinicians to study natural and pathological levels of behavior and map somatosensory cortex in an objective manner. In this study, a microcontroller-based system was developed which can deliver vibrotactile stimulation to all five fingers of the hand. The system also delivers hot and cold temperature sensation through stacked thermoelectric modules. In order to synchronize the stimulation onset with neural data which can be acquired with a bioamplifier simultaneously, the microcontroller transfers a trigger signal through its digital I/O port or via universal serial bus (USB) with low latency. Our preliminary results demonstrate that our system can be used to study sensory processing with improved temporal precision in an objective fashion. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Monocular visual SLAM has become a popular research area in recent years because of its advantages of requiring low-cost hardware and providing high computational efficiency. This paper presents a multiple maps based SLAM system with four threaded architecture. When multiple maps are introduced the system works consistently in a large area for significant length of time. A new map is created automatically when tracking fails or the size of the map becomes too large. Tracking using multiple small maps reduces the accumulation of errors in visual SLAM to a significant extent when compared with a single map. To enhance the robustness of tracking an algorithm for predicting the camera pose is introduced. Exhaustive evaluations performed on publicly available indoor and outdoor datasets show that our system satisfies real-time requirements for robotics applications while providing superior accuracy to state-of-the-art systems. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Cellular devices support various technical features and services for 2G, 3G, 4G and upcoming 5G networks. For example, these technical features contain physical layer throughput categories, radio protocol information, security algorithm, carrier aggregation bands and type of services such as GSM-R, Voice over LTE etc. In the cellular security standardisation context, these technical features and network services termed as device capabilities and exchanged with the network during the device registration phase. In this paper, we study device capabilities information specified for 4G and 5G devices and their role in establishing security association between the device and network. Our research results reveal that device capabilities are exchanged with the network before the authentication stage without any protection and not verified by the network. Consequently, we present three novel classes of attacks exploiting unprotected device capabilities information in 4G and upcoming 5G networks - identification attacks, bidding down attacks, and battery drain attacks against cellular devices. We implement proofof- concept attacks using low-cost hardware and software setup to evaluate their impact against commercially available 4G devices and networks.We reported identified vulnerabilities to the relevant standardisation bodies and provide countermeasure to mitigate device capabilities attacks in 4G and upcoming 5G networks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={A single-camera stereo-digital image correlation (stereo-DIC) system to obtain 3D full-field vibration measurements is proposed. The optical setup is composed of two planar mirrors and a single low frame rate camera, thus resulting in a compact and low-cost equipment. The two mirrors are used to create pseudo-stereo images of a target surface on the camera sensor, which are then correlated by using stereo-DIC. The image acquisition process is carried out at low frame rates and the Nyquist-Shannon frequency limitation is overcome by adopting a down-sampling approach under the hypothesis that the vibration signal is characterized by a single known frequency component. The developed pseudo-stereo DIC system allows to obtain 3D full-field vibration measurements in a frequency range up to 4 kHz even with an available frame rate (at full resolution) of 178 fps. The effectiveness of the described approach has been verified by performing vibration measurements on a cantilever plate and a turbine blade. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With expansion of neural network (NN) applications lowering their hardware implementation cost becomes an urgent task especially in back-end applications where the power-supply is limited. Stochastic computing (SC) is a promising solution to realize low-cost hardware designs. Implementation of matrix multiplication has been a bottleneck in previous stochastic neural networks (SC-NNs). In this paper, we introduce spintronic components into the design of SC-NNs. A novel spin-CMOS matrix multiplier is proposed in which the stochastic multiplications are performed by CMOS AND gates while the sum of products is implemented by spintronic compressor gates. The experimental results indicate that compared to the conventional binary implementations the proposed hybrid spin-CMOS architecture can achieve over 125x, 4.5x and 43x; reduction in terms of power, energy and area consumptions, respectively. Moreover, compared to previous CMOS-based SC-NNs, our design saves the power by 3.1x-7.3x, reduces energy consumption by 3.1x-7.3x and decreases area by 1.4x-7.6x while maintaining similar recognition rates. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={The advent of mobile and wearable computing technology has opened up tremendous opportunities for health and wellness applications. It is increasingly possible for individuals to wear devices that can sense their physiology or health-related behaviors, collecting valuable data in support of diagnosis, treatment, public health, or other applications. From a researcher's point of view, the commercial availability of these 'mHealth' devices has made it feasible to conduct scientific studies of health conditions and to explore health-related interventions. It remains difficult, however, to conduct systems work or other experimental research involving the hardware, software, security, and networking aspects of mobile and wearable technology. In this paper we describe the Amulet platform, an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device designed specifically for mHealth applications.

abstract={Renewable energy incorporation in many countries takes different forms. In many developed countries, grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) installations are widely coupled with lucrative Feed-in-Tariffs (FiT). However, conventional grid-tied solutions are not readily viable in many developing countries mainly due to intermittent grids with load shedding and, in some cases, lack of net-metering or FiT. Load shedding refers to an intentional electrical power shutdown by the utility company where electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. This results in a non-continuous availability of the utility grid for many consumers over the course of a day. In this work, the key challenges in the integration of solar energy explicitly in residential power back-up units are reviewed and system hardware level requirements to allow optimized solar PV utilization in such intermittent grid environments are analyzed. Further, based upon the low-cost sensing and real-time monitoring scheme, an online optimization framework enabling efficient solar incorporation in existing systems to achieve minimum grid dependence in intermittent grid environments is also provided. This work is particularly targeted for over 1.5 billion residents of semi-electrified regions in South Asia and Africa with the weak and intermittent grid. © 2019 by the authors.},

For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation tasks. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently become the state-of-the-art technique for crucial signal processing applications such as patient-specific ECG classification, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection in power electronics circuitry and motor-fault detection. This is an expected outcome as there are numerous advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D CNN instead of a conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D CNNs can be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D deep CNNs, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need datasets with massive size, e.g., in the »Big Data» scale in order to prevent the well-known »overfitting» problem. 1D CNNs can directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage, vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre- or post-processing such as feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc. Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such adaptive 1D CNNs that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible. This paper reviews the major signal processing applications of compact 1D CNNs with a brief theoretical background. We will present their state-of-the-art performances and conclude with focusing on some major properties. Keywords - 1-D CNNs, Biomedical Signal Processing, SHM. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of heterogeneous types of robots in swarms implies the ability to control them uniformly if their characteristics are relatively close. The robots involved in our swarm are indoor differential wheeled robots equipped with 2 to 6 wheels from several manufacturers. All these robots have different hardware components, but they all share the same asynchronous serial communication. To unify the communication for those kinds of robots, we propose to build a low-cost hardware abstraction layer. This project uses a Raspberry Pi on the robot as the primary interface between the serial link of the robots and a computer. In this paper, authors present the software framework, and the protocol required to communicate with this interface, locally or remotely, using a hardware structure defined with the low-cost Raspberry Pi as the heart the system. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Dexterous multi-fingered robotic hands can perform a wide range of manipulation skills, making them an appealing component for general-purpose robotic manipulators. However, such hands pose a major challenge for autonomous control, due to the high dimensionality of their configuration space and complex intermittent contact interactions. In this work, we propose deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) as a scalable solution for learning complex, contact rich behaviors with multi-fingered hands. Deep RL provides an end-to-end approach to directly map sensor readings to actions, without the need for task specific models or policy classes. We show that contact-rich manipulation behavior with multi-fingered hands can be learned by directly training with model-free deep RL algorithms in the real world, with minimal additional assumption and without the aid of simulation. We learn to perform a variety of tasks on two different low-cost hardware platforms entirely from scratch, and further study how the learning can be accelerated by using a small number of human demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that complex multi-fingered manipulation skills can be learned in the real world in about 4-7 hours for most tasks, and that demonstrations can decrease this to 2-3 hours, indicating that direct deep RL training in the real world is a viable and practical alternative to simulation and model-based control. https:// sites.google.com/view/deeprl-handmanipulation. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, multiple wind turbine failure databases have reviewed that pitch bearings are one of the subassemblies with the highest failure rates, and largest contributors to overall downtime. If a monitoring technology is developed and can give an early warning about the pitch bearing condition, the maintenance process can be largely improved; downtime and losses can be minimized. Electrical signature analysis (ESA) has been extensively investigated for years to monitor wind turbine main drivetrain structural health condition, including generator bearings, multi-stage gearbox gears and bearings. ESA has advantages of being low cost, hardware free (no additional sensor is required), has minimum impacts on system normal operation, and can be directly applied to commercial drive units to provide an online remote condition-based monitoring solution. In this paper, ESA is used to monitor and trend deterioration of pitch bearing health condition. Various fault indicators (FIs) has been investigated, a detailed comparison indicates negative-sequence FI is the most sensitive to detect single-axis pitch bearing failure. This hardware-free solution is validated by both simulation and field data from MW-scale wind farms and turns out to be the first field-validated effort to use ESA to monitor pitch bearing health condition, and provide single-axis pitch bearing defect detection, as reported in the literature. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with few centimeters of diameter and sub-10 Watts of total power budget, have so far been considered incapable of running sophisticated visual-based autonomous navigation software without external aid from base-stations, ad-hoc local positioning infrastructure, and powerful external computation servers. In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 27g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end, closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. Our visual navigation engine is enabled by the combination of an ultra-low power computing device (the GAP8 system-on-chip) with a novel methodology for the deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We enable onboard real-time execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18Hz. Field experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5m/s. In addition, we also demonstrate the capability of our visual navigation engine of fully autonomous indoor navigation on a 113m previously unseen path. To share our key findings with the embedded and robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous nano-UAVs, we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained networks. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots is an outdoor robotics contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater, and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks ~83% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored with the Creativity Award “for building a land robot from scratch in less than 2 days when their ground platform broke.”. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Modern electrophysiological experiments are moving towards closing the loop, where the extrinsic (behavioral) and intrinsic (neuronal) variables automatically affect stimulation parameters. Rodent experiments targeting spatial behavior require animal 2D kinematics to be continuously monitored in a reliable and accurate manner. Cameras provide a robust, flexible, and simple way to track kinematics on the fly. Indeed, several available camera-based systems yield high spatiotemporal resolution. However, the acquired kinematic data cannot be accessed with sufficient temporal resolution for precise real-time feedback. New method: Here, we describe a novel software and hardware system for movement tracking based on color-markers with real-time low-noise output that works in both light and dark conditions. The analog outputs precisely represent 2D movement features including position, orientation, and their temporal derivatives, velocity and angular velocity. Results: Using adaptive windowing, contour extraction, and rigid-body Kalman filtering, a 640-by-360 pixel frame is processed in 28 ms with less than 4 ms jitter, for 100 frames per second. The system is robust to outliers, has low noise, and maintains a smooth, accurate output even when one or more markers are temporarily missing. Using freely-moving mice, we demonstrate novel applications such as replacing conventional sensors in a behavioral arena and inducing novel place fields via closed-loop optogenetic stimulation. Comparison with existing method(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tracking system that yields analog output in real-time. Conclusions: This modular system for closed-loop experiment tracking can be implemented by downloading an open-source software and assembling low-cost hardware circuity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={For reliable and cost-saving diagnosis of 3D printer faults, a customer-goods level attitude sensor is employed to collect healthy condition data of the printer. To make up for the inferior precision of the low-cost hardware, a suboptimal networked deep learning (SNDL) method is developed. In addition to conventional deep learning architecture composed of pre-training and fine-tuning, there are two new merits for SNDL. A pre-classifying strategy is first proposed to adaptively determine the suboptimal network structure. A fine-classifying approach is on the other hand adopted for further improving fault classification performance. In the experiments, the attitude sensor is installed on the end of the transmission chain (i.e., the printing head of the delta 3D printer). Motion signals collected from all channels of the sensor are used as the input vector of the suboptimal networks, which are developed by deep Boltzmann machines for the big data-driven fault diagnosis. The addressed SNDL method is compared with peer methods. The results show that the present SNDL is capable of effectively diagnosing transmission faults for the 3D printer. © 2019 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

abstract={Presented here is a new bench-top research device for the measurement of the optical turbidity of natural sediment-laden water samples. This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0–5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable. A new methodology, described here, facilitates the cross-comparability of turbidity measurements. © 2019 The Authors},

Each TestBox in the testbed connects to an MQTT broker over WiFi, no dedicated wiring or back-end is needed.

abstract={Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization is one of the most promising approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave’s DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, with the ongoing rapid advancements in technology, a constant challenge faced by educators is the need to design new and relevant laboratory projects. This can be a time-consuming and costly affair, which, if neglected, will lead to outdated laboratory projects and a degradation in learning outcomes for the students.

abstract={Visible Light Communication (VLC) exploits optical frequencies, diffused by usual LED lamps, for adding data communication features to illuminating systems. This paradigm has attracted a growing interest in both scientific and industrial community in the latter decade. Nevertheless, classical wireless communication mechanisms for physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers are hardly available for VLC, due to the massive external interference caused by sunlight. A correct signal carrier recover in high noise conditions represent a significant challenge. In this work, it is shown that the synchronization frame length affects the performance of the system in terms of Bit Error Ratio (BER). Since different external conditions require different minimum preamble lengths, we considered an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, based on multi-arm bandit formulation, for obtaining a low impact in both BER and goodput of the communication. A low-cost hardware VLC system, implementing a learning algorithm on a Frequency Shift Keying Modulation (FSK), has been designed and tested in different environmental conditions. Experimental results show that a proper choice of preamble length overcomes, in terms of BER and goodput, the classical approach based on fixed preambles. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The estimation and prediction of state-of-health (SOH) and state-of-charge (SOC) of Lithium-ion batteries are two main functions of the battery management system (BMS). In order to reduce the computation cost and enable deployment of the BMS on the low-cost hardware, a Lebesgue-sampling-based extended Kalman filter (LS-EKF) is developed to estimate the SOH and SOC. An LS-EKF is able to eliminate unnecessary computations, especially when the states change slowly. In this paper, the SOH is first estimated and the remaining useful life is predicted by the LS-EKF. Then, the estimated SOH is used as the initial battery capacity for SOC estimation and prediction. The SOH and SOC estimation and prediction are calculated repeatedly in the whole battery service life. The proposed method is verified with the application to the capacity degradation of the Lithium-ion battery. The results show that the LS-EKF-based algorithm has a good performance in SOH and SOC estimation and prediction in terms of accuracy and computation cost. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Localization systems based on Visible Light Communication (VLC) are considered as good candidates for indoor environments, due to their high accuracy, low costs and the possibility of reusing existing infrastructures for both lighting and positioning. However, high level of environmental noises, mainly due to sunlight, significantly affect the performance of VLC positioning systems. A novel approach, for easily measuring environmental noises and compensating their effects, has been proposed in this work. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is adopted to divide the total bandwidth into a series of non-overlapping frequency sub-bands corresponding to each signal, while an estimation of Signal to Noise Ratio, obtained through real time Power Spectral Density measure, is exploited to compensate error positioning due to sunlight and other wide-band external optical nice sources. Proposed approach has been validated through experimental tests, carried out using a simple deployment of low power lamps, extremely low cost hardware and a Software Defined approach. In the region under test, receiver positions have been experimentally detected according to an improved accuracy in comparison with classical FDM approach, confirming the correctness of proposed technique, according to low Signal to Noise Ratio levels. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the major concerns for fruit selling companies, at present, is to find an effective way for rapid classification and detection of fruit defects. Olive is one of the most important agricultural product, which receives great attention from fruit and vegetables selling companies, for its utilization in various industries such as oils and pickles industry. The small size and multiple colours of the olive fruit increases the difficulty of detecting the external defects. This paper presents new efficient methods for detecting and classifying automatically the external defects of olive fruits. The proposed techniques can separate between the defected and the healthy olive fruits, and then detect and classify the actual defected area. The proposed techniques are based on texture analysis and the homogeneity texture measure. The results and the performance of proposed techniques were compared with varies techniques such as Canny, Otsu, local binary pattern algorithm, K-means, and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. The results reveal that proposed techniques have the highest accuracy rate among other techniques. The simplicity and the efficiency of the proposed techniques make them appropriate for designing a low-cost hardware kit that can be used for real applications. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Considering its low-cost equipment, single-point incremental forming (SPIF) can be appropriate for rapid prototyping of sheet metal parts, since a simple hemispherical head tool is usually implemented without any dedicated dies. Incremental forming at elevated temperatures assisted by electric current, which is hereafter called resistance SPIF, is an innovative process for forming sheet metals with a high-strength-to-weight ratio and a low formability at room temperature. In the present research, the effect of utilizing various lubricants on both the formability and surface finish of the Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy sheet is investigated using the resistance SPIF of the truncated cone at different feed rates, vertical pitches, and currents. To this end, the Taguchi design of experiment and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed. A cooling water system is designed and applied to the forming tool to improve both its life and the duty cycle of the process. The results show that the formability of Ti–6Al–4V sheet can be enhanced using the resistance SPIF, which strongly depends on the lubrication condition. In order of significance, the lubricant and current have the most influence on the maximum achievable forming depth and the lubricant, the feed rate, and the vertical pitch have the highest effects on the surface roughness. Based on the ANOVA results, the graphite-based anti-seize compound and the graphite powder are suggested for an appropriate surface finish and the highest formability, respectively, in the resistance SPIF within the range of the considered parameters. © 2019, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.},

The source composition corresponds to the quality parameters of fresh beef to be detected. At the same time, according to the 8 LED light source, the light source design layout structure of probe point symmetry, 8 light sources inside the probe to the detector as the center, symmetric distribution, while using LED light source divergence angle, determine the installation position of the light source to the sample surface and the vertical distance of each light source, to ensure the light source to the sample area is uniform. In addition, the probe embedded within the design of signal acquisition, amplification and transmission components, signal acquisition part uses the spectral response range of 400~1 100 nm light intensity detector, sample diffuse intensity after processing to the host computer through the signal acquisition and amplification circuit, and the software finished modeling and analysis. Finally in order to verify the performance of the detection system, with fresh beef freshness in the color parameter (L*, a*, b*) and the pH value as the index was tested using 60 samples, 8 light source under the original light intensity value and corrected reflectance values respectively, and then the beef samples according to 3:1 the proportion is divided into set and prediction set correction, for the original value of light intensity and reflectivity values, respectively, using multiple linear regression (MLR), Multiple Linear Regression Partial Least Squares Regression partial least squares regression (PLSR) and partial least squares support vector machine regression Partial Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) three methods, model parameters in the original light intensity and reflectivity data of the two cases, and get the best results.

The LS-SVR modeling results of parameter pH value are better than that of PLSR and MLR, and the correlation coefficient of the prediction set is 0.942 0 and the error is 0.19.

abstract={Computational methods for the enhancement of energy efficiency rely on a measurement process with sufficient accuracy and number of measurements.

This paper introduces YoMoPie, a user-oriented energy monitor based on the Raspberry Pi platform that aims to enable intelligent energy services in households. YoMoPie measures active as well as apparent power, stores data locally, and integrates an easy to use Python library. Furthermore, the presented energy monitor comes with a Python API enabling the execution of user-designed services to enhance energy efficiency in buildings and households. Along with the presented design, possible applications that could run on top of this system such as residential demand response, immediate user feedback, smart meter data analytics, or energy disaggregation are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented, which compares the measurement accuracy of YoMoPie to a certified energy analyser for a selection of common household appliances. © 2018 IEEE.},

The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n = 22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular, we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and engineering courses.

abstract={This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development. Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers’ community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the recent way to join low-cost hardware and cloud computing, in order to manage a network of physical devices and their data collection. During the last years the number of devices connected to IoT is dramatically increased, as well as, the number of webservices which allow to collect and manage the data. Most of these services are free for personal use, and low-cost for commercial purposes. In this work, the IoT technology was employed to monitor the health status of maritime signals, such as buoys, seamarks, beacons, etc. The developed system allows to react swiftly and efficiently if a problem occurs, in order to preserve both the safety of navigation and the signals integrity. Furthermore, the developed hardware equipment is low-cost as well as the webservices employed to notify possible problems. The system was, initially, developed to follow the position of a buoy using a GNSS device for this reason, even now, the system name is "Buoy Monitoring System" (BMS). Specifically, the paper describes the system design, its realization and the results obtained in terms of reliability; the case study regards all light maritime signals that operate in the Taranto harbor. © 2018 IEEE.},

The CUI can generate an impact greatly on the industry, because it can occur in equipment without warning. An inspection system was designed to detect the CUI from the outside of a steel plate using a non-destructive testing associated with the eddy current technique. This research is to develop a prototype device and software for CUI detection by using low-cost equipment. 600-1000 Hz sinusoidal signals induced by a sine wave function generator were applied to detect CUIs, and the results were demonstrated by the proposed CUI detection program. The experimental results reveal that the pick-up coil with laminated core probe can detect the CUIs effectively, and the designed sinusoidal eddy current system with the proposed CUI detection program can monitor and detect the CUIs with up to 3 mm insulation thickness. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce. Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for specific monitoring applications and working environments. © IWA Publishing 2019.},

abstract={It seems that computing systems that imitate the brain can be achieved by integrating of electronics and neuroscience. In recent years, neuromorphic systems have been developed by the fusion of electronics and neuroscience. Since neurons are the basis of neural systems, constructing the optimized digital neuron plays a critical role in neuromorphic applications. Furthermore, the dynamic of ionic channels, which are the causative agents of synaptic plasticity is the main characteristic of biological neurons. The Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model is a mathematical description of biological neuron that is widely used in neuroscience to explore the relation of action potential propagation and information transmission. This model consists of nonlinear differential equations, which approximates the electrical characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac muscle. In this paper, a simplified version of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model was proposed by substituting its complex nonlinear dynamics with linear ones. Next, a digital circuit for the proposed linear model was designed, which can be implemented on a low-cost hardware platform, such as field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Comparison of MATLAB simulation of original model and Vivado simulation of the proposed digital circuit confirm that obtained results are in good agreement. The proposed digital circuit compared with the earlier circuits is more successful in terms of replicate essential characteristics of spiking responses and ionic currents in the biologically plausible model of neural activities. This new digital design will be applicable in developing neuro-inspired chips and exploring the brain's functionality in information processing. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Human–robot interaction in natural settings requires filtering out the different sources of sounds from the environment. Such ability usually involves the use of microphone arrays to localize, track and separate sound sources online. Multi-microphone signal processing techniques can improve robustness to noise but the processing cost increases with the number of microphones used, limiting response time and widespread use on different types of mobile robots. Since sound source localization methods are the most expensive in terms of computing resources as they involve scanning a large 3D space, minimizing the amount of computations required would facilitate their implementation and use on robots. The robot's shape also brings constraints on the microphone array geometry and configurations. In addition, sound source localization methods usually return noisy features that need to be smoothed and filtered by tracking the sound sources. This paper presents a novel sound source localization method, called SRP-PHAT-HSDA, that scans space with coarse and fine resolution grids to reduce the number of memory lookups. A microphone directivity model is used to reduce the number of directions to scan and ignore non significant pairs of microphones. A configuration method is also introduced to automatically set parameters that are normally empirically tuned according to the shape of the microphone array. For sound source tracking, this paper presents a modified 3D Kalman (M3K) method capable of simultaneously tracking in 3D the directions of sound sources. Using a 16-microphone array and low cost hardware, results show that SRP-PHAT-HSDA and M3K perform at least as well as other sound source localization and tracking methods while using up to 4 and 30 times less computing resources respectively. © 2019},

abstract={Cosmic rays represent not only a significant health risk to the crew of spacecraft and aircraft but also a fundamental phenomenon of basic research on the origin and composition of the universe. High-energy atmospheric physics is a newly opened research domain which focuses on research of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that can measurably contribute to the aircraft-crew irradiation according to the preliminary computer simulations. High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both the con-tinual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of AIRDOS is built on the Open Hardware modular platform MLAB, the firmware is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is freely available. Two AIRDOS de-vices have been installed at Basic Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available, including the Liulin MDU. Preliminary results of comparative measure-ments of radiation environment at BEO Moussala using the AIRDOS units and Liulin MDU will be presented. The results from BEO Moussala will be compared with data acquired on board aircraft. © 2019 Author(s).},

abstract={The complexity and heterogeneity of digital devices used in embedded systems is increasing everyday and delivering a bug-free design is still a very complex task. The interest for open-source hardware in real products is demanding for tools and advanced methodologies for verification to provide high reliability to open and free IPs. In this work, an open-source evolutionary optimizer has been used to create functional test programs that improve the verification test set for an open-source microprocessor, enhancing in this way, the verification level of the device. The verification programs are generated to optimize code coverage metrics and are tested against a high-level model to find device incorrectnesses during the generation time. A perturbation mechanism has been included in the verification framework to cover parts of the device under verification not reachable with only software stimuli such as interrupts or memory stalls. The proposed methodology uncovered 10 bugs still present in the RTL description of the analyzed device and demonstrated the effectiveness of open-source verification tools for the next generation of open-source RISC-V microprocessors. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This article presents an innovative and low-cost solution for optimizing the acquisition of performance data of small-laboratory-scale photovoltaic devices. A novel measuring setup is proposed, designed based on an Arduino microcontroller and low-cost components, coupled with open source hardware and software. The manuscript describes in detail the instrument design, components and assembly enabling the reproduction and customization of the instrument for any reader. The setup is combined with an optional web-platform, which enables fast analysis and comparison of the collected data. For the demonstration of the instrument in operation, comparison of measurements of solar cell with the developed setup and commercial products has been conducted. It is shown that the presented prototype provides values of accuracy and precision during I-V curve recording, comparable with the values measured using a commercial source-meter (Keithley 2400).

abstract={An important challenge for our society is the transformation of traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The eye tracking field is an area highly studied by different researchers. In addition, there are companies that offer commercial eye trackers, but they are usually economically restrictive. However, current technology allows to design embedded eye tracking systems, capable of running on low-cost hardware. This paper presents the implementation of a real-time eye-detection method that uses the properties of isophotes, to achieve robustness against changes in illumination, eye rotation and pupil size. The method is implemented in a portable platform, reduced both in computing power and in RAM memory. The performance is evaluated using different eye tracking methods implemented by the authors on the same platform. For this purpose, a database generated on this hardware is used. This database is composed of a set of low-resolution near-infrared eyes-images created with the dark pupil technique, using a lightweight glasses head unit. Results show the robustness of the method and a significant accuracy improvement over the methods analyzed. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.

Due to the simple implementation, it is suitable for real-time processing in the low-cost hardware. In order to evaluate the precision of the estimated position, stochastical models of sensors (with parameters matching real hardware sensors) were used and random trajectories were simulated.

abstract={In this letter, a novel norm-1 regularized imaging technique, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, is presented. This technique divides the sensing matrix of the imaging system in submatrices by columns. This method is capable of imaging metallic targets with a reduced amount of measurements, by sectioning the imaging domain into several regions and optimizing them individually in different nodes. This technique reduces the amount of information to be shared among the nodes, compared to the consensus ADMM that divides the sensing matrix into submatrices by rows. This makes the communication among the nodes faster for large imaging domains that need to be distributed into several computational nodes of a cluster. A compressive reflector antenna (CRA) has been recently proposed as a low cost hardware to provide high sensing capacity. The use of the columnwise division ADMM algorithm in combination with the imaging capabilities of the CRA allows a distributed and quasi-real-time imaging, while reducing the communications among the computational nodes. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is of high importance both for diagnostics, since drug resistance is primarily caused by the acquisition of SNPs in multiple drug targets, and for epidemiological studies in which strain typing is performed by SNP identification. To provide the necessary coverage of clinically relevant resistance profiles and strain types, nucleic acid-based measurement techniques must be able to detect a large number of potential SNPs. Since the Mtb problem is pressing in many resource-poor countries, requiring low-cost point-of-care biosensors, this is a non-trivial technological challenge. This paper presents a proof-of-concept in which we chose simple DNA-DNA hybridization as a sensing principle since this can be transferred to existing low-cost hardware platforms, and we pushed the multiplex boundaries of it. With a custom designed probe set and a physicochemical-driven data analysis it was possible to simultaneously detect the presence of SNPs associated with first- and second-line drug resistance and Mtb strain typing. We have demonstrated its use for the identification of drug resistance and strain type from a panel of phylogenetically diverse clinical strains. Furthermore, reliable detection of the presence of a minority population (<5%) of drug-resistant Mtb was possible. © 2019 Wood et al.

abstract={Traditional manufacturing systems consist of devices with limited functionality and are constructed in a vertical structure. This is not suitable for smart factory environment where Internet of Things (IoT) is actively utilized and connected to external environment. Cyber Physical System (CPS), a key element of the Smart Factory, means that cyber and physical systems are tightly connected and intelligent. To build a CPS, IoT needs to be handled effectively, and stability and connectivity must be ensured. Therefore, the system in the Smart Factory is preferably built according to the IoT standard. In this paper, we propose an industrial device monitoring and control system based on oneM2M, and discuss that this system can be applied in a smart factory environment. The proposed system is based on Mobius, developed by Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI) as an open source IoT platform, and its components are open source hardware which is high performance with low cost. The Smart Factory system can be constructed in various forms using Mobius. In this paper, a model for its structure and utilization is presented. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Thanks to the increasing interest on robotics prosthetic devices controlled by means of physiological signals, a continuously increasing number of solutions are proposed. Usually the proposed solutions are very expensive and created ad-hoc for the final user. For this reason, a large part of the possible users can not afford this kind of technology. Furthermore, the software adaptation to the user is time consuming and physically stressing for the subject. The paper presents a low cost prosthesis framework, which covers the three fundamental aspects of a rehabilitation system, i.e. the prosthesis, the sensors used to record the physiological signals, and the software connecting the two previous points. To reduce the costs we chose a 3D printed prosthetic hand from an open-source project. We recorded Electromyography (EMG) signals from the subjects' muscles by using a low cost armband, a all-in-one solution easy to wear and remove. The EMG signals are preprocessed in order to be used online, and they are used to train a probabilistic model for classification purposes. Furthermore, the model is built on data from different subjects, in order to develop a subject-independent framework, which can be used by any subject, with no need of draining training phases. We test the goodness of our solution with a leave-one-out approach by classifying three different hand grasps. Finally, the 3D printed hand reproduces the movement performed by the subject. Data were recorded from four different subjects, each of them repeating the selected movements five times, and we obtained an overall accuracy of 76.8%. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil. New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil. Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination. Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals. © 2018},

abstract={A successful phytosanitary treatment demands that the product must be uniformly distributed over the foliar surface of the tree. Modern trends are about the doses reduction of the active product, through the technological upgrade of the terrestrial sprayer vehicles. The traditional ways to apply these products over the field are using mechanical continuous rate sprayers. This yield a continuous application, even in undesired empty spaces such as between plants or missing plants. The Victoria de Girn Fruit Company of Jagueÿ Grande, Cuba, were suited with a lot of air assisted mechanical sprayer of the TEYME manufacturer. This paper is focused on the design of a low cost hardware and software architecture, addressed on the automation of the variable application of pesticides, through tree detection in citrus plantations. The designed system is composed by two distributed subsystems: The one embedded in the tractor is responsible of the positioning and tree inventory update, the other, embedded in the air-assisted sprayer detects the tree presence using ultrasonic methods. The performed experiments, showed a suitable acquisition of the position of the system. It was confirmed that the designed prototype allows the detection of plants with an accuracy of 98%. The proposed architecture makes it possible to reuse existing vehicles by improving spraying. This will make it possible to save pesticides by reducing costs and pollution. These results are extendable to other fruit fields that employ a spraying system. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a low-cost hardware implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for channel state information (CSI) prediction. We first employ LSTM algorithm to the predication of channel state information. To reduce the hardware cost, the stochastic computing is employed to design the LSTM accelerator. The complex arithmetic operations are converted to simple logic gates. For instance, the multiplication is performed by an AND gate and tanh function is implemented by a finite state machine. According to the implementation report, the proposed stochastic LSTM reduce the hardware cost about 70%, which provides a promising technology for the future communication system design. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Combining fluorescence and transmitted light sources for microscopy is an invaluable method in cellular neuroscience to probe the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cells. This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with µManager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca 2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take ∼1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed. © 2019 Battefeld, Popovic, van der Werf and Kole.},

abstract={Infrastructureless wireless sensing is beneficial for environmental monitoring in various application scenarios, such as in a disaster where it is vital for the operational planning of professional responders, or in documenting long-Term changes in climate and biodiversity in natural heritage sites. In this paper, we present a low-cost yet flexible and powerful hardware/software platform for sensing, computation, and infrastructureless wireless communication. Since energy usage is a key issue for autonomous operation, we investigate the power requirements of various computing platforms, sensors and radio link technologies. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate several license-free radios (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa 433 MHz and 868 Mhz) in terms of their real-world communication ranges. To avoid wasting precious communication resources, we apply machine learning and image-based concept detection on-device to remove irrelevant data before sending it. We also evaluate neural compute sticks to improve performance and optimize their power consumption in our scenario. The proposed hardware/software platform consists of small, low-power sensor nodes based on microcontrollers, larger single board computer relay nodes that can also preprocess data, and Bluetooth Low Energy enabled smartphone add-ons to give mobile devices access to long range communication technology. Finally, a Linux distribution tailored to the specific needs in this application area is presented that makes deploying new relay nodes easy even for non-specialists. © 2018 IEEE.},

Previous solutions can only be applied to the minimum system, such as TOA method with three sensors or need matrix inversion. To solve this problem, a simple closed-form solution for a multi-station redundancy localization system is proposed by using the estimation variance as the weighting coefficient to compute an average of each group's localization result. The proposed method, with simple algebraic solution, requires no matrix inversion and can be used for low-cost hardware devices. The method is derived in TOA solution. It can also be extended to other locating technologies. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method in root-mean-square error. The positioning accuracy of the proposed method is close to Cramér-Rao low bound. © 2018 IEEE.},

By interviewing 37 open source hardware company leaders, 12 company community members as well as analyzing forum data of 3 open source hardware companies; we realize that by open sourcing the design of hardware, a company can naturally establish its community, which is a key element for a company's success. Establishing a community can increase customer perceived value, decrease product development and sales cost, shorten product go-to-market time, and incubate startups with knowledge, experience and resources. These advantages can compensate for the risks associated with open source strategies and can make open source design a viable product development strategy for hardware startups. © 2019 Design Society.

Though many research efforts explored whether the same level of co-creation efforts could take place broadly in the hardware realm, very few research studies focus on profit-seeking hardware projects initiated by companies. In fact, the specific nature of being tangible and profitable makes company-led open source hardware projects suspicious to be really “open” to contributors. Community has been identified as the critical driver in many open projects. By reviewing the evolution of company-community interactions over time and different community behaviors in different open development context, authors in this paper hope to identify best community-company interaction forms for open source hardware companies. Using grounded theory and case studies, we construct a framework to describe and identify company community's different behaviors and different roles. © 2019 Design Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Open source paradigm is becoming widely accepted in scientific communities and open source hardware is finding its steady place in chemistry research. In this review article, we provide the reader with the most up-to-date information on open source hardware and software resources enabling the construction and utilization of an “open source capillary electrophoresis instrument”. While CE is still underused as a separation technique, it offers unique flexibility, low-cost, and high efficiency and is particularly suitable for open source instrumental development. We overview the major parts of CE instruments, such as high voltage power supplies, detectors, data acquisition systems, and CE software resources with emphasis on availability of the open source information on the web and in the scientific literature. This review is the first of its kind, revealing accessible blueprints of most parts from which a fully functional open source CE system can be built. By collecting the extensive information on open source capillary electrophoresis in this review article, the authors aim at facilitating the dissemination of knowledge on CE within and outside the scientific community, fosters innovation and inspire other researchers to improve the shared CE blueprints. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Open source design of hardware products is an emerging phenomenon that takes more and more importance today's in the society. However, open source (hardware) design implies a tremendous change in both design practices and philosophy because it is partly related to the movements of creative commons and the sharing economy. From this perspective one could think that participation is crucial in the success of open source design projects. In this paper, we analyse 9 case studies in the light of 3 hypotheses. If many studies highlight the potential of the crowd as a resource for design tasks, our study shows that for open source design communities the participation is not massive. In this study, we used an activity-based approach to build our model. As open source design processes are fairly unstructured and based on voluntary participation, it is impossible to adopt a classical task-based model. With the help of this model, we were able evaluate the overall size of the active community, the participation rate with regards to the activities. This study paves the way to deeper and extensive studies on how to support communities engaged in open source design of hardware products. © 2019 Design Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={To be secure, cryptographic algorithms crucially rely on the underlying hardware to avoid inadvertent leakage of secrets through timing side channels. Unfortunately, such timing channels are ubiquitous in modern hardware, due to its labyrinthine fast-paths and optimizations. A promising way to avoid timing vulnerabilities is to devise-and verify-conditions under which a hardware design is free of timing variability, i.e., executes in constant-time. In this paper, we present IODINE: a clock-precise, constant-time approach to eliminating timing side channels in hardware. IODINE succeeds in verifying various open source hardware designs in seconds and with little developer effort. IODINE also discovered two constant-time violations: one in a floating-point unit and another one in an RSA encryption module. © 2019 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The seismic refraction method has undoubted value for near-surface characterisation but its use is generally quite limited. This is often ascribed to the cost of purchasing the required equipment, often exceeding $20,000. In this paper we describe an alternate, low-cost, method for acquiring seismic refraction data. It involves the use of cheap, widely-available, open-source hardware with a total cost of less than $150, coupled with a simple, though innovative, processing method. As well as the cost of the equipment the new system also allows data to be acquired more quickly (8 minutes vs. 30 minutes for a conventional system). Although the data acquired is lower quality, due to the higher noise level, it is still sufficient for shallow applications and can be improved by stacking. © 2018 SEG.},

abstract={Open source hardware for scientific equipment needs to provide source files and enough documentation to allow the study, replication and modification of the design. In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment. © 2019 Machado et al.

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been deployed in almost every facet of our day to day activities. This is made possible because sensing and data collection devices have been given computing and communication capabilities. The devices implement System-on-Chips (SoCs) that incorporate a lot of functionalities, yet they are severely constrained in terms of memory capacitance, hardware area, and power consumption. With the increase in the functionalities of sensing devices, there is a need for low-cost synthesizable processors to handle control, interfacing, and error processing. The first step in selecting a synthesizable processor core for low-cost devices is to examine the hardware resource utilization to make sure that it fulfills the requirements of the device. This paper gives an analysis of the hardware resource usage of ten synthesizable processors that implement the Reduced Instruction Set Computer Five (R1SC-V) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). All the ten processors are synthesized using Vivado v2018.02. The maximum frequency, area, and power reports are extracted and a comparison is made to determine which processor is ideal for low-cost hardware devices. Copyright. © 2019 KIPS.},

abstract={A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent developments in sensing and monitoring technology allow the application of various sensors and sensor networks for tunnel maintenance. Most maintenance monitoring techniques focus on measuring physical parameters of and within the tunnel structure it-self, with less emphasis placed on the ground conditions surrounding the tunnel structure. Soft soil, weak soil or grouted soil zones are particularly susceptible to long-term changes in ground condition and thus, extensive monitoring is essential to ensure long term tunnel stability and accurate numerical analysis. This study proposes a ground monitoring sensor system for tunnel maintenance using geophysical techniques. The proposed system uses seismic wave velocity and electrical resistivity techniques to estimate the changes in the geomechanical properties of the ground. A low cost prototype sensor was created using open source hardware and software and preliminary tests were conducted on an open area test site. The results show that the system can adequately perform seismic and electrical resistivity tests for tunnel maintenance purposes. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of disciplines. Controlled-environment devices are increasing their functionalities as well as improving their accessibility. Traditionally, building one of these devices from scratch implies knowledge in fields such as mechanical engineering, digital electronics, programming, and energy management. However, the requirements of an effective controlled-environment device for personal use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper presents the OpenAg™ Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size platform, which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also hobbyists, makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12). The PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that can be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis. Thanks to its modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of activities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Access control systems provide a security application for controlling access of persons through controlled gates. The gate, such as a door, can have a lock mechanism for securing the area from unauthorized access. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) / Near Field Communication (NFC) is a key technology for sensor communication enabling a ubiquitous and pervasive computing network, popularly employed in access control systems. In this paper we investigate a case study about the migration of an old chip card based access control system to this new way of authorizing people, based on NFC tags. To this aim, we propose a Model Driven approach that supports (semi) automatic code generation for enabling the communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of NFC and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open source hardware platform) technologies with model driven techniques. As a consequence, it allows the reduction of the implementation efforts, by also providing snippets as exemplary code usage, while making the whole development process less error-prone and time consuming.

abstract={The purpose of this document is to evaluate the implementation of technology to the hydroponics technique. Knowing that classical cultivation requires the permanent care of the human being for the irrigation of water and tender of the nutritive solution, it is proposed to use technology to replace the basic functions of crop irrigation through the use of programmable and reprogrammable microcontrollers, thus following the free hardware culture, this paper evaluates a scalable system with sensors, an open source hardware and software platform to interact between analog and digital signals. Within the steps that comprehend the realization of the project, the methodology based on components, provides the appropriate guidance for the analysis and choice of hardware, thus allowing the integration of the electronic components to work along with the appropriate coding; as a result the project will collect the pH value present in the nutrient solution, if the value is not adequate, it will automatically activate the insertion of the solution to the container reservoir, to subsequently operate the automated water irrigation for hydroponic farming. Another relevant aspect is that the project can be improved with other devices that will allow an even greater control of variables and data of hydroponics crops. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Modern innovative concepts around Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICTs), like Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things or Smart Grids, are impacting the scientific and technological worlds and, hence, in control and automation arenas. These trends involve networked interconnection and continuous data flow between a number of hardware and software actors. In parallel, open source technology has gained increasing attention from last years, especially due to the widespread presence of the open source hardware Arduino microcontroller. Focusing on industrial advanced frameworks, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are required to exchange data with new smart devices, sensors and/or actuators. Arduino boards are commonly used as development platforms for such smart devices. Therefore, communication solutions must be designed towards the convergence of open source hardware and widely used traditional SCADA-devoted software. This paper presents a system that seamlessly integrates Arduino boards into a LabVIEW-based SCADA system through Ethernet connection. The open connectivity provided by the Open Platform Communications (OPC) protocol enables such integration. The proposed framework is a novelty in scientific literature. The development of the system is reported and initial results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={An automated method based on open-source hardware was created for the separation of porphyrins fractions from crude oil, an essential step for the quantification of V and Ni as metalloporphyrins. Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes.

abstract={Speaking and hearing plays an important role in effective teaching, individuals who lack these abilities faces an uphill battle. Quantum of researches has focused on designing various approaches to teach deaf and mute students. However, assessing whether students are following the course materials by creating an active learning environment is very difficult in this context. Integrating IoT technologies into their classroom can add an immense value in this area by providing interactive low-cost solution which can solve the purpose and also improve the quality and efficiency of the education system thereby making education more appealing than ever before. This paper presents the review and case study of various existing solutions and design and development of one such system using low cost hardware and MQTT lightweight protocol for efficient device to device communication to encourage active learning environment in the classroom without much modifications in the existing academic infrastructure. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Embedded video-processing applications are everywhere, and need to be low-energy in order to extend battery life. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), frequently used for this task, fail to explore the intrinsic redundancy present in videos: similarity between sequential frames means that analyzing all frames can be avoided. On top of that, while several hardware solutions for low-energy execution have been proposed, they require extra or dedicated hardware, which makes them non attractive for low cost applications. In this work we propose a technique that uses frame similarity to identify and process only areas that have a significant difference when comparing two subsequent frames. Our technique reduces energy consumption by discarding unneeded operations, and can also be used in low-cost hardware readily available for IoT applications. We obtain up to 12-80x speedup of CNN execution with software-only modifications that require no network retraining while impacting little on accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={This paper proposes to add subpixel accuracy to the unsynchronized unstructured light method while achieving high-speed dense reconstruction without any camera-projector synchronization. This allows scanning faces which is notoriously difficult due to involuntary movements on the part of the model and the reduced possibilities of 3D scanner approaches such as laser scanners because of speed or eye protection. The unsynchronized unstructured light method achieves this with low-cost hardware and at a high capture and projection frame rate (up to 60 fps). The proposed approach proceeds by complementing a discrete binary coded match with a continuous interpolated code which is matched to subpixel precision. This subpixel matching can even correct for erroneous camera-projector correspondences. The obtained results show that highly accurate unfiltered 3D models can be reconstructed even in difficult capture conditions such as indirect illumination, scene discontinuities, or low hardware quality.

Here, we present a prototype of a soft pneumatic haptic device based on an inflatable hyperelastic membrane, that can provide two stimuli over skin such as pression and traction with only one input of energy. The device was fabricated using different types of silicone materials and membrane shapes. This exhibits experimentally a maximum vertical deformation of 13 mm and a tangential displacement of 10 mm at 7 kPa. These two mechanically programmed movements open the possibility of using this technology in mechano-Tactile feedback for wearable devices, with low-cost hardware, soft interaction between devices and skin, and lightweight.

Since they don't require movement of any part of the body, BCI are the natural choice for assisted communication when a person is unable to move. In this article, BCI based communicator for persons in locked-in state is described. It is based on P300 brain response of the user, thus does not require prior training, movement or imagination of movement. Auditory paradigm is selected in order to apply the communicator in cases where visual ability is also impaired. The communicator was designed to prove also whether low cost hardware with reduced electrode set could be used efficiently in everyday environment, without the need for expert personnel. The design of the communicator is described first, followed by detailed analyses of the performance when used by either healthy or disabled subjects. It is shown that auditory paradigm is the primary factor that limits the accuracy of communication. Hardware characteristics and reduced electrode set influence the accuracy in a negative way as well, while different questions and answer types produce no major differences. © 2019-Vilnius University.},

abstract={Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults worldwide. Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost, among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes open-source hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator (PACoGen) for the recently developed universal number posit number system, along with a set of pipelined architectures. The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length 'regime-bit' and 'exponent-bit' (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Some people with severe disabilities are confined in a state in which communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts into words. The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software, and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces’ social media presence serve as the ‘front door’ for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different ‘front doors’ of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces’ social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces’ social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and differences between makerspaces’ social media presences in the same geographical region have the strength of producing different identities across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential participation in Open Design. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In Colombia, sugarcane is one of the most important crops with about 235,000 hectares cultivated at the end of 2017. Therefore, establishing and implementing research projects pursuing objectives as the design of agricultural production procedures which allow more productivity, cleanness, and efficient processes are welcome. We present a wireless sensor network proposal oriented to deal with the lack of monitoring in some agronomic/climatic variables. The prototype is intended to measure variables such as temperature and soil/air moisture. Also measured are soil pH and the most relevant greenhouse gases, i.e., carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. We focused our work in measuring the greenhouse gases to analyze the values in parts per million, seeking to establish a reference point to potentially calculate the carbon footprint associated to the sugarcane cultivation. The closed-chamber technique was used for the measurements and the initial results showed that the gases concentrations were higher outside the chamber: 376Â ppm of CO2, 1.31Â ppm of CH4, and 0.504Â ppm of N2O (outside) compared with the values inside them: 291Â ppm of CO2, 1.01Â ppm of CH4, and 0.163Â ppm of N2O (inside) as average values. Nevertheless, bias was observed during the measurements due to the high current demand the gas sensors needed. We expect to solve these issues and increase the amount of measurements for upcoming releases of the presented prototype. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Avoiding gray water remainders behind wet floor cleaning machines is an essential requirement for safety of passersby and quality of cleaning results. Nevertheless, operators of scrubber dryers frequently do not pay sufficient attention to this aspect and automatic robotic cleaners cannot even sense water leakage. This paper introduces a compact, low-cost, low-energy water streak detection system for the use with existing and new cleaning machines. It comprises a Raspberry Pi with an Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, an illumination source, and a camera to observe the floor after cleaning. The paper evaluates six different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures on a self-recorded water streak data set which contains nearly 43000 images of 59 different floor types. The results show that up to 97% of all water events can be detected at a low false positive rate of only 2.6%. The fastest CNN Squeezenet can process images at a sufficient speed of over 30 Hz on the low-cost hardware such that real applicability in practice is provided. When using an NVidia Jetson Nano as alternative low-cost computing system, five out of the six networks can be operated faster than 30 Hz. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Modern computer systems are becoming faster, more efficient, and increasingly interconnected with each generation. Thus, these platforms grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that affected all major hardware vendors. In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we construct the first representative testbed of real-world software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work, we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future research in hardware security verification and contributing to the open-source hardware landscape. © 2019 by The USENIX Association.

abstract={Microplate (i.e. microwell plate) is a flat plate that has a specific number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies. In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines. © 2019 IEEE.},

The simulator was built using low-cost hardware components and open source software libraries. They conducted a face validation study with five experts who were either adult/pediatric nephrologists or interventional/diagnostic radiologists. The trainer was rated very highly (>4.4) for the usefulness of the real US images (highest at 4.8), potential usefulness of the trainer in training for needle visualization, tracking, steadiness and hand-eye coordination, and overall promise of the trainer to be useful for training US-guided needle biopsies. The lowest score of 2.4 was received for the look and feel of the US probe and needle compared to clinical practice. The force feedback received a moderate score of 3.0. The clinical experts provided abundant verbal and written subjective feedback and were highly enthusiastic about using the trainer as a valuable tool for future trainees. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

abstract={Gateways prevail in IoT (Internet of Things) set-ups for connectivity, privacy, and other reasons; however, there has not been a generic and open-source framework offering authentication, identity management, policy administration and policy evaluation as a service for such a scenario. Meanwhile, cloud-based security solutions are available, but they use too much memory and CPU to be deployed in low-cost hardware typically used for IoT gateways such as the Raspberry Pi. In our work, we identified critical requirements for a generic security framework that could be deployed to low-cost hardware used for IoT gateways. From this point on, we implemented the security framework, and modified a Content Management System (CMS) to rely on the framework for authentication and policy evaluations. We evaluated our component’s runtime performance and computational resource consumption in comparison to a popular attribute-based security framework written in Java. We measured the CPU, memory, and network usage for each security framework, their databases, and the CMS across three different hardware platforms. To ensure our results are not biased towards a particular hardware set-up, we chose hardware with two different processor architectures, different capabilities and vendors. Our results indicate that our framework not only requires less time to complete requests but also makes less intensive use of the processor and the memory, i.e., the most critical capabilities for IoT gateways today. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to determine and verify the exact location of radiation therapy fields by using port-film and digital reconstruction radiograph (DRR) as a low-cost tool. Initially, an appropriate algorithm was written for the application of port film in the megavoltage beam irradiation. Detectable contrast was created for the image and then by using appropriate markers and developed written program by MATLAB as DRrPortRegistartion. Semi-automatic and automatic registration between port-film and DRR images were performed for pelvic and chest phantoms. Then, results were compared with electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images in similar conditions. By using this software, DRR and port film as treatment verification tools, the precision of treatment verification and the accuracy of radiation therapy fields were achieved in the extent of the millimeter. Validation results with EPID demonstrated that the mean absolute average error in angle is equal to 0.59 degrees, 1.70 mm in the X-direction, and 2.42 mm in the Y-direction. The results of this study illustrated that using this software and suitable low-cost hardware in the machines without EPID can increase the precision of treatment verification to the millimeter and it can be introduced as a suitable alternative for EPID in centers for increasing treatment accuracy.

abstract={In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of an open hardware–software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also support the suitability of the proposed platform. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={In archaeological excavations, many small fragments or artefacts are revealed whose fine details sometimes should be captured in 3D. In general, 3D documentation methods fall into two main categories: Range-Based modelling and Image-Based modelling. In Range Based modelling, a laser scanner (Time of Flight, Structured light, etc.) is used for the raw data acquisition in order to create the 3D model of an object. The above method is accurate enough but is still very expensive in terms of equipment. On the other hand, Image-Based modelling, is affordable because the equipment required is merely a camera with the appropriate lens, and possibly a turntable and a tripod. In this case, the 3D model of an object is created by suitable processing of images which are taken around the object with a large overlap. In this paper, emphasis is given on the effectiveness of 3D models of frail archaeological finds originate from the palatial site of Ayios Vasileios in Laconia in the south-eastern Peloponnese, using low-cost equipment and methods. The 3D model is also produced using various, mainly freeware, hence low-cost, software and the results are compared to those from a well-established commercial one. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

This paper presents the design and building of an automatic three-phase alternator synchronizer based on a low-cost open-hardware Arduino platform. The synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive. The design and practical implementation of the system is proposed as a project-based learning (PBL) activity for undergraduate final year students at the University of Bío-Bío, Chile.

abstract={Due to the ease of handling with low resolution images, low cost hardware and high recognition accuracy, palmprint recognition has been attracting in the recent years. Many different features extracted of the palmprint image have been employed to perform the recognition tasks. Most of the recognition efforts consequently has been put on the designing and obtaining a relevant set of effective hand-crafted features which is considered to be the drawback of the traditional image based biometric recognition systems. To overcome the aforementioned problem, in this paper we explore the applicability of MobileNet V2 deep convolutional neural networks on palmprint recognition by fine-tuning a pretrained MobileNet neural networks. We also explore the performance of dropout support vector machines (SVM) by training them on the deep features of the similar pretrained networks. The experiments are carried out using datasets provided by Hong Kong Polytechnic University of Science and Technology. The dataset consists of 6000 grayscale images of 128x128 pixels from 500 different palms. It is demonstrated that the proposed schemes exhibit state-of-the-art performance on the datasets. The second scheme, MobileNet V2 based features with SVM classifier, is able to achieve best average testing and validation accuracy rate of 100% outperforming the best previous reported results. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={IoT Green Corridor is a distributed sensor network system, a working prototype of which has been designed in-house and using low-cost hardware for economically-viable implementation. This paper outlines the development of the prototype and describes its details. This proposed system combines the existing conventional traffic signal lights with networked-sensors across length and breadth of connected and usually-congested city roads. Being connected to the internet, the sensors are better-enabled and capable of synchronizing with each other for sharing localized traffic information including the presence of emergency vehicles like ambulances. Having been equipped with the situational awareness data, the sensor network in an IoT framework is capable of collective decision to manage a given set of the traffic signal lights in tandem to achieve the singular aim of providing smooth passage to the arriving ambulances or in general to any Emergency Vehicle (EMV). Every traffic-signal junction is to be retrofitted with the Green Corridor system prototype, which is required to sense the presence of an Emergency Vehicle (EMV) within a specified distance in the field of view of the sensors. Based on a positive identification of such vehicles in distress, the traffic flow is designed to quickly enable the EMV to cross the junction smoothly in least time as possible. In the absence of a system of this kind, a manual intervention would have to be made by the concerned agency or valuable golden hour time to save lives would be spent in the traffic junctions. Besides, the prototype communicates with the inter-connected adjacent sensor-network elements through the cloud network to initiate similar action at each of the traffic signals enroute the desired destination of the emergency vehicle. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Two main approaches are currently prevalent in the digital emulation of musical instruments: manipulation of pre-recorded samples and techniques of real-time synthesis, generally based on physical models with varying degrees of accuracy. Concerning the first, while the processing power of present-day computers enables their use in real-time, many restrictions arising from this sample-based design persist; the huge on disk space requirements and the stiffness of musical articulations being the most prominent. On the other side of the spectrum, pure synthesis approaches, while offering greater flexibility, fail to capture and reproduce certain nuances central to the verisimilitude of the generated sound, offering a dry, synthetic output, at a high computational cost. We propose a method where ensembles of lightweight neural networks working in parallel are learned, from crafted frequency-domain features of an instrument sound spectra, an arbitrary instrument’s voice and articulations realistically and efficiently. We find that our method, while retaining perceptual sound quality on par with sampled approaches, exhibits 1/10 of latency times of industry standard real-time synthesis algorithms, and 1/100 of the disk space requirements of industry standard sample-based digital musical instruments. This method can, therefore, serve as a basis for more efficient implementations in dedicated devices, such as keyboards and electronic drumkits and in general purpose platforms, like desktops and tablets or open-source hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From a conceptual point of view, this work highlights the advantages of a closer integration of machine learning with other subjects, especially in the endeavor of new product development. Exploiting the synergy between neural networks, digital signal processing techniques and physical modelling, we illustrate the proposed method via the implementation of two virtual instruments: a conventional grand piano and a hibrid stringed instrument. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In this work are proposed computer vision approaches to detect three of the main defects found in beans: broken, bored by insect (Acanthoscelides obtectus) and moldy. In addition, we describe a fast and robust segmentation step that is combined with the proposed approaches to compose a computer vision system (CVS) applicable to the Brazilian beans quality inspection process, to determine the type of the product. The proposed approaches constitute an important practical contribution since, although there are some papers in the literature addressing visual inspection of beans, none of them deals with defects. In the conducted experiments a low-cost equipment, composed by a table made in structural aluminum, a conveyor belt and an image acquisition chamber, was used to simulate the characteristics of an industrial environment. The CVS evaluation was performed in two modes: offline and online. In the offline mode, a database composed by 120 images of bean samples containing grains of different classes and with different defects was employed, while in the online mode the grains contained in a batch were spilled continuously in the conveyor belt of the equipment for the proposed CVS to perform the tasks of segmentation and detection of defects. In the experiments the CVS was able to process an image of 1280×720 pixels in approximately 2 s, with average hit rates of 99.61% (offline) and 97.78% (online) in segmentation, and 90.00% (offline) and 85.00% (online) in detecting defects. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={As conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy generally produce images with blurring at the upper and lower planes along the z-axis due to non-focal plane image information, the observation of biological images requires “deconvolution.” Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software.

These ionic liquids were then used in the development of our electro-recycling process. While their recycling yields are still moderated due to recombination and disproportionation reactions, this unprecedented recycling technology is very promising in terms of environmental and economic gains. Indeed, it has a high energy efficiency, requires low cost equipment, allows a strong decrease of the price of such ionic solvents, limits the use of non-renewable resources and solves the end-of-life problem of dirty biobased ionic liquids. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={In order to solve the jitter problem in traditional dental 3D scanner, a novel 3D dental scanner based on camera array is proposed. Camera array can obtain three-dimensional information directly by single snapshot, avoiding the influence of jitter during scanning. Moreover, the size of the tooth is small, the micro lens array is selected to replace the camera array, and the parallelism of the optical axis between the cameras can be ensured. The experimental result shows that the system finally realizes the depth and disparity acquisition of a single tooth. Besides, the system is simple in structure, which is preparation for subsequent miniaturization and low cost equipment for 3D measurement of intra-oral teeth and further promotes the digitalization of medical data. © 2019, Editorial Board of Optical Technique.

abstract={The search for Cosmic-Ray Ensembles (CRE), groups of correlated cosmic rays that might be distributed over very large areas, even of the size of the planet, requires a globally spread and dense network of detectors, as proposed by the Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) Collaboration. This proposal motivates an effort towards exploring the potential of using even very much diversified detection technologies within one system, with detection units located even in hard-to-reach places, where, nevertheless, the sensors could work independently - without human intervention. For these reasons we have developed a dedicated communication solution enabling the connection of many different types of detectors, in a range of environments. The proposed data transmission system uses radio waves as an information carrier on the 169MHz frequency band in a contrast to the typical commercially used frequencies in a IoT systems (868MHz). The connectivity within the system is based on the star topology, which ensures the least energy consumption. The solution is now being prepared to being implemented using the prototype detection system based on the CosmicWatch open hardware design: a portable, pocket size, and economy particle detector using the scintillation technique. Our prototype detector is equipped with a dedicated software that integrates it with the already operational CREDO server system. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).},

abstract={In this paper, we deal with the development of a high speed monitoring system using opensource hardware and MATLAB/Simulink. We use the Arduino Due as opensource hardware. The proposed high speed monitoring system has four features. First, it does not affect the operation of the user application running on a micro-controller. The proposed system performs realtime monitoring using an algorithm that minimizes the computational load. Second, data channels can have different data types and update periods. Consequently, flexible data monitoring is possible. Third, the proposed system uses MATLAB/Simulink for monitoring. As a result, users can utilize all the powerful functions supported by MATLAB to process the monitored data. Finally, the algorithm of the proposed high speed monitoring system can be applied to any micro-controller with serial communication peripheral. Through experiments, we verify the performance of the developed monitoring system. It is shown that the data loss does not happen through the basic experiment. Through realtime monitoring experiment for the sensorless drive system of the BLDC motor, it is illustrated that the proposed system has its strength in high speed monitoring of data changing very fast such as current or back EMF signals. © ICROS 2019.},

Especially when communicative or collaborative tasks must be performed, there exist challenges about realistic embodying and integrating such avatar representations. A shared comprehension of local space and non-verbal communication (like gesture, posture or self-expressive cues) can support these tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to create realistic, video-texture based avatars of co-located users in real-time and integrate them in an immersive virtual environment. We show a straight forward and low-cost hard- and software solution to do so. We discuss technical design problems that arose during implementation and present a qualitative analysis on the usability of the concept from a user study, applying it to a training scenario in the automotive sector.

These images are three-dimensional data structures, where the x and y axes contain spatial information and the z-axis contains spectral information or image bands. Usually, these bands can reach the order of hundreds, generating a considerable amount of information. Due to storage limitations and communication bandwidth, the use of compression techniques becomes essential. For spatial applications, a standard commonly used in the literature is CCSDS 123, developed by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, which describes the algorithm for lossless compression of hyperspectral images. In this context, we implemented the prediction stage of the CCSDS 123 algorithm in the Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA. The developed processor provides a good trade-off to meet real-time requirements at low-cost. © 2019 IEEE},

abstract={Despite the fact that the open-source community around the RISC-V instruction set archi- tecture is growing rapidly, there is still no high-speed open-source hardware implementation of the IEEE 754-2008 oating-point standard available. We designed a Fused Multiply-Add Floating- Point Unit compatible with the RISC-V ISA in SystemVerilog, which enables us to conduct de- tailed optimizations where necessary. The design has been verified with the industry standard simulation-based Universal Verification Methodology using the Specman e Hardware Verification Language. The most challenging part of the verification is the reference model, for which we in- tegrated the Floating-Point Unit of an existing Intel processor using the Function Level Interface provided by Specman e. With the use of Intel's Floating-Point Unit we have a "known good" and fast reference model. The Back-End ow was done with Global Foundries' 22 nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (GF22FDX) process using Cadence tools. We reached 1.8 GHz over PVT corners with a 0.8 V forward body bias, but there is still a large potential for further RTL opti- mization. A power analysis was conducted with stimuli generated by the verification environment and resulted in 212 mW. © The Authors 2019.},

abstract={Many countries implement competitions in physics for high school students such as the national 'Physics Olympiads' that are often used to select students for participation in the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO), the Asian Physics Olympiad (APhO) or the Ibero-American Physics Olympiad (OIbF). Typically, in these competitions students are requested to solve theory and experimental problems. The latter are usually challenging experiments performed with relatively low-cost equipment. However, these Olympic experiments rarely have widespread dissemination, despite their great potential to be used back in a high-school context, in original form or in an adapted version. A comparative study of the students' learning gain of the classical capacitor discharge experiment, a compulsory experiment for Portuguese K-18 (pre-university) students, with an Olympic inspired version using the LM555 timer circuit was performed in seven Portuguese high-schools, involving 175 students. We conclude that the more challenging, Olympic inspired, experiment is rated higher in interest by the students and is more effective in helping students to learn the physics concepts involved in the RC circuit, as gaged by the results of pre- A nd post-tests. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The visualization toolkit (VTK) is a popular cross-platform, open source toolkit for scientific and medical data visualization, processing, and analysis. It supports a wide variety of data formats, algorithms, and rendering techniques for both polygonal and volumetric data. In particular, VTK's volume rendering module has long provided a comprehensive set of features such as plane clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting, and other controls needed for visualization. However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend and its reliance on a deprecated API, the system did not take advantage of the latest improvements in graphics hardware or the flexibility of a programmable pipeline. Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated pipeline posed restrictions when running on emerging computing platforms, thereby limiting its overall applicability. In response to these shortcomings, the VTK community developed a new and improved volume rendering module, which not only provides a modern graphics processing unit-based implementation, but also augments its capabilities with new features such as fast volume clipping, gradient-magnitude-based opacity modulation, render to texture, and hardware-based volume picking. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={A robust method is proposed for people tracking using range cameras: Density Map Tracking with Blob Splitting (DMT-BS). It was designed primarily for worker safety in industrial environments, but can be used in other applications as well. Multiple cameras can easily be added to resolve occlusions and to enlarge the observed area. The method could be used to track any moving object in an otherwise static environment as the detection does not rely on a specific human model. Its strength lies in its simplicity, making the behavior predictable and opening possibilities to be implemented on low-cost hardware. From the point cloud delivered by the depth sensor, a 2D density map is formed in floor coordinates followed by basic 2D-tracking. Robustness of this tracking is enhanced using a simple but effective blob splitting technique. Tests show that the camera position, depth noise, and extrinsic calibration errors have little influence on the tracker's performance. The proposed method was tested on three depth tracking datasets, reaching significantly better MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy) scores when compared to two state-of-the-art depth-based trackers. © 2019-IOS Press and the author(s).

The system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database (subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including real-Time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to greenhouses.

abstract={This paper aims to design a stable, reliable, energy-efficient yet low-cost structural health monitoring (SHM) system for bridges in remote regions. First, the integrated system design was adopted based on the Linux architecture, and the power-efficient opensource hardware was taken as the mini Linux PCs on the bridge site. Next, several sensor subsystems were integrated physically via the Ethernet, while nine core software modules were developed based on opensource software and integrated into a logical whole. The stability of the system was improved through dual PC redundancy and intelligent fault diagnosis. The data collected by sensors were analyzed in real time and only the valid data and alarms were transmitted to the remote monitoring center. In addition, the remote transmission and active control were completed, with the aid of 3G/4G router, VPN and reverse SSH tunneling. In this way, the author developed an easy-to-maintain and cost-efficient SHM system. Finally, the effectiveness of the system was verified through the application in a bridge on an expressway in Yunnan Province, China. The results fully demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and cost effectiveness of the proposed system. This research fills up the gap in Linux-based SHM system design for bridges in remote regions, providing a reliable and advanced reference for the construction of bridge SHM systems. © 2019 Lavoisier.

abstract={Automatic video surveillance systems are usually designed to detect anomalous objects being present in a scene or behaving dangerously. In order to perform adequately, they must incorporate models able to achieve accurate pattern recognition in an image, and deep learning neural networks excel at this task. However, exhaustive scan of the full image results in multiple image blocks or windows to analyze, which could make the time performance of the system very poor when implemented on low cost devices. This paper presents a system which attempts to detect abnormal moving objects within an area covered by a 360$$^\circ $$ camera. The decision about the block of the image to analyze is based on a mixture distribution composed of two components: a uniform probability distribution, which represents a blind random selection, and a mixture of Gaussian probability distributions. Gaussian distributions represent windows in the image where anomalous objects were detected previously and contribute to generate the next window to analyze close to those windows of interest. The system is implemented on a Raspberry Pi microcontroller-based board, which enables the design and implementation of a low-cost monitoring system that is able to perform image processing. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Emerging power system protection and control applications require faster-responding measurements and more accurate knowledge of the actual latency of the measurement and communications systems. A new method for accurately determining the reporting latency of a phasor measurement unit (PMU) has been developed and demonstrated. This method operates in real-time, works passively for any existing PMU without requiring changes to the PMU hardware or software, and it is very accurate - providing a measurement uncertainty of ¡500 ns in many cases, significantly surpassing the 0.002 s accuracy requirement in the most recent IEEE Synchrophasor standard. Only low-cost hardware and open source software are required. It is particularly important to understand end-to-end system latency, including the impact of local and wide-area communications, rather than just the latency of the PMU device; the proposed method also supports such practical measurements. It is therefore shown how this advance can be used to enable efficient, but realistic, cross-domain power system simulation studies, which incorporate measurement and communications delays. These capabilities address complexity and uncertainty in the design and operation of future PMU-based protection and control functions for new smart grid services. © 2013 IEEE.},

Compared with previous low-complexity techniques, simulation results indicated that the proposed design demonstrated superior performance in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluations. A weighting technique and a contour preserving estimation approach are adopted alternately to refine the factors in the defogging process. Furthermore, in the atmospheric light estimation, an adjuster is applied to the video for preventing 'flicker' which means that the brightness changes dramatically between two neighbor frames in the video. Hence, the proposed algorithm is suitable for video defogging applications, which have not been dealt with in previous approaches. To achieve the requirement of real-time applications for both static and dynamic images, an implementation of seven-stage very-large-scale integration architecture for the proposed algorithm is presented. By using TSMC 0.13- mu mathrm m technology, the design yielded a processing rate of approximately 200 Mpixels/s. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Traffic management and car parking on modern cities continues to be a problem both for citizens and for city officials. The increasing number of vehicles flowing into the city drain the existing scarce parking resources, and the increase in time spent looking for a parking spot leads to more congestions, parasitic traffic, whilst augmenting fuel consumption and air pollution. In this paper we present an integrated flexible solution developed to help address this issue, using open hardware and software components to develop a low-cost smart parking system suitable for contemporary metropolitan cities. The smart parking solution is based on Arduino boards for the sensors network and on Raspberry Pi single-board computers for the gateway devices, integrated through specific developed software components and a mobile application for the end-users. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Open platform architecture products (OPAP) are the key enablers for this paradigm. Based on explorative literature analysis, with practical insights from an industrial questionnaire survey, an Innovation toolkit for the end-user has been developed. This provides a means for selecting an optimal OPAP. The design of the Innovation toolkit has been approached in four different steps: modelling of OPAP Products; modelling of evaluation measures and evaluation indices with end-user preferences; identification of the optimal module options for every configuration and Configuration optimisation. Two case studies have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and to illustrate that the Innovation toolkit can readily be applied to these types of product development to obtain highly individualised and optimised OPAP. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.},

abstract={Graphics processing units (GPUs) are a powerful platform for building high-speed network traffic processing applications using low-cost hardware. Existing systems tap the massively parallel architecture of GPUs to speed up certain computationally intensive tasks, such as cryptographic operations and pattern matching. However, they still suffer from significant overheads due to critical-path operations that are still being carried out on the CPU, and redundant inter-device data transfers. In this paper we present GASPP, a programmable network traffic processing framework tailored to modern graphics processors. GASPP integrates optimized GPU-based implementations of a broad range of operations commonly used in network traffic processing applications, including the first purely GPU-based implementation of network flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly. GASPP also employs novel mechanisms for tackling control flow irregularities across SIMT threads, and sharing memory context between the network interface and the GPU. Our evaluation shows that GASPP can achieve multi-gigabit traffic forwarding rates even for computationally intensive and complex network operations such as stateful traffic classification, intrusion detection, and packet encryption. Especially when consolidating multiple network applications on the same device, GASPP achieves up to 16.2× speedup compared to standalone GPU-based implementations of the same applications. © Proceedings of the 2014 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, USENIX ATC 2014.

abstract={(Figure Presented) Measuring ingestive behavior of liquids in rodents is commonly used in studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-cage measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications. © 2019 Godynyuk et al.},

abstract={Although drip tapes are low-cost equipment, proper hydraulic evaluation is important to provide information required for irrigation system design. The aim of this study was to analyze the friction head loss and the friction factor in drip tapes with molded emitters, that are employed in drip irrigation systems. Experiments evaluated the drip tape model Rain-Tape®, manufactured by Rain Bird, 225-µm wall thickness, labyrinth-type emitters, 0.30-m emitters spacing, 1 L h-1 nominal discharge and operating pressure of 55 kPa. The following conclusions were obtained: (a) the equation of head loss for smooth turbulent flow as a function of flow rate and pressure head at the pipe inlet provided good predictions of head loss in drip tapes with molded emitters, since 95% of predictions presented relative errors less than 6.71%; (b) the Darcy-Weisbach equation may be used for calculating head loss, but the pipe diameter must be replaced by a function considering the lateral inlet pressure; (c) for calculating head loss of the Rain-Tape using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the friction factor obtained by the Blasius equation should use the coefficient a = 0.3408. © 2019, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

abstract={In the field of Affective Computing, one of the most important issues is the identification of the emotional state of a subject. There are a plethora of research works in emotion identification, works that have their foundations in other fields such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive sciences. Nowadays, with the emergence of wearable devices and DIY electronics kits, the interest in developing emotion identification systems with these low-cost devices has gained more attention. The use of low-cost devices came out with new challenges related to the low quality of the signals acquired due to less noise-tolerant sensors which are used in real-life environments. In this context, the main objective of this work is to present a methodology, based on machine learning techniques for time series forecasting, to build models able to identify emotional states, from signals acquired from low-cost devices, as accurately as a professional medical device can do. To this end, we proposed the use of two devices: Nexus-10 MKII, a biofeedback and neurofeedback system from MindMedia, used to obtain reference measure, and BiTalino (r)evoltuion Boar Kit (BiTalino hereinafter), a low-cost physiological signals acquisition device from PLUX Wireless Biosignals S.A. In this work,11 Machine Learning models have been developed to predict the emotional state, identified by Nexus-10, with the signals provided by BiTalino. Our experiments show that the best model was a Random Forest which can predict the emotional state in the test set with a RMSE of 0.172 and a R2 of 0.858.

abstract={Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized biological research by generating genomic data that were once unaffordable by traditional first-generation sequencing technologies. These sequencing methodologies provide an opportunity for in-depth analyses of host and pathogen genomes as they are able to sequence millions of templates at a time. However, these large datasets can only be efficiently explored using bioinformatics analyses requiring huge data storage and computational resources adapted for high-performance processing. High-performance computing allows for efficient handling of large data and tasks that may require multi-threading and prolonged computational times, which is not feasible with ordinary computers. However, high-performance computing resources are costly and therefore not always readily available in low-income settings. We describe the establishment of an affordable high-performance computing bioinformatics cluster consisting of 3 nodes, constructed using ordinary desktop computers and open-source software including Linux Fedora, SLURM Workload Manager, and the Conda package manager. For the analysis of large antibody sequence datasets and for complex viral phylodynamic analyses, the cluster out-performed desktop computers. This has demonstrated that it is possible to construct high-performance computing capacity capable of analyzing large NGS data from relatively low-cost hardware and entirely free (open-source) software, even in resource-limited settings. Such a cluster design has broad utility beyond bioinformatics to other studies that require high-performance computing. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Ultrasound (US)-guided renal biopsy is a critically important tool in the evaluation and management of non-malignant renal pathologies with diagnostic and prognostic significance. It requires a good biopsy technique and skill to safely and consistently obtain high yield biopsy samples for tissue analysis. This project aims to develop a virtual trainer to help clinicians to improve procedural skill competence in real-time ultrasound-guided renal biopsy. This paper presents a cost-effective, high-fidelity trainer built using low-cost hardware components and open source visualization and interactive simulation libraries: interactive medical simulation toolkit (iMSTK) and 3D Slicer. We used a physical mannequin to simulate the tactile feedback that trainees experience while scanning a real patient and to provide trainees with spatial awareness of the US scanning plane with respect to the patient's anatomy. The ultrasound probe and biopsy needle were modeled using commonly used clinical tools and were instrumented to communicate with the simulator. 3D Slicer was used to visualize an image sliced from a pre-acquired 3-D ultrasound volume based on the location of the probe, with a realistic needle rendering. The simulation engine in iMSTK modeled the interaction between the needle and the virtual tissue to generate visual deformations on the tissue and tactile forces on the needle which are transmitted to the needle that the user holds. Initial testing has shown promising results with respect to quality of simulated images and system responsiveness. Further evaluation by clinicians is planned for the next stage. © 2019 SPIE.},

abstract={Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the low-cost of high performance optoelectronic and robotics components has supported a resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. We describe a low cost (below $700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed ‘lab-on-a-comb’ to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of ~420 × 300mm, which allows 29 ‘lab-on-a-comb’ devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1μl samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes. © 2019 Needs et al.

abstract={Current integrated circuits exhibit an impressive and increasing power density. In this scenario, thermal modelling plays a key role in the design of next generation cooling and thermal management solutions. However, extending existing thermal models, or designing new ones to account for new cooling solutions, requires parameter identification as well as a validation phase to ensure correctness of the results. In this paper, we propose a flexible solution to the validation issue, in the form of a hardware platform based on a Thermal Test Chip (TTC). The proposed platform allows to test a heat dissipation solution under realistic conditions, including fast spatial and temporal power gradients as well as hot spots, while collecting a temperature map of the active silicon layer. The combined power/temperature map is the key input to validate a thermal model, in both the steady state and transient case. This paper presents the current development of the platform, and provides a first validation dataset for the case of a commercial heat sink. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Background. Accurate laser scanning of plaster casts using validated, low-cost hardware represents a key issue in 3D orthodontics. Objectives. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of measurements taken from plaster casts (gold standard) with digital models of those casts created with a low-cost structural light DAVID laser scanner. Material and methods. Five different measurements were taken on each of 14 plaster casts by 2 independent observers with an electronic caliper. The measurements were repeated 10 times on all 14 plaster casts by each observer, with a 1-week interval between each set of measurements. All 14 plaster casts were digitized using a low-cost DAVID SLS 3 laser scanner. The same 5 measurements were performed on each of the 3D virtual surface models of the 14 plaster casts by 2 independent observers using Meshlab software in a manner similar to that used with the digital caliper. The measurements were repeated 10 times by the 2 observers with 1 week between each set of measurements. Results. The laser-scanned models were more accurate than the plaster cast models in defining measurements based on simple tooth fissures. The accuracy of measurements based on complex tooth fissures were equivalent for the 2 types of model. For measurements based on interproximal dental contacts, the 2 methods of measurement were similar and both were notably poor in terms of accuracy. Conclusions. Three-dimensional virtual models obtained from the low-cost DAVID laser scanner can be used clinically, but only for certain types of measurements and indications. © 2019 by Wroclaw Medical University.},

abstract={PURPOSE Worldwide, more than 80% of people diagnosed with cancer will require surgery during their disease course, but only 5% to 20% of low- and middle-income countries have access to safe, affordable, and timely surgery. Developing surgical oncology skills requires significant time and mentoring. Virtual reality (VR) simulators can reduce the time required to master surgical procedures but are prohibitively expensive. We sought to determine whether a VR simulator using low-cost computer gaming equipment could train novice surgeons in Africa to perform a virtual radical abdominal (open) hysterectomy (RAH). METHODS Our RAH VR simulator used the Oculus Rift (Oculus VR, Menlo Park, CA), a VR headset with hand controllers that costs less than $1,500. Surgical novices learned to perform five key steps of a virtual RAH. We measured and identified predictors of movement and time efficiency for the simulation. RESULTS Ten novice surgeons in Lusaka, Zambia, enrolled in the study. Movement and time efficiency greatly improved over time. Independent predictors of movement efficiency were number of simulations, surgical experience, and time since college graduation. Independent predictors of time efficiency were number of simulations, surgical experience, days between simulation sessions, age, sex, and an interaction between number of simulations and surgical experience. CONCLUSION Low-cost VR may be an effective tool to help surgical novices learn complex surgical oncology procedures. If learning to perform VR surgical procedures with low-cost hardware leads to faster mastery of surgical procedures in the operating room, low-cost VR may represent one of the solutions to increasing access to surgical cancer care globally. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract={The integration of cognitive radio (CR) technology with the future Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture is expected to allow effective massive IoT deployment by providing huge spectrum opportunities to the IoT devices. Several communication protocols have been proposed for the CR networks while ignoring the adjacent channel interference (ACI) problem by assuming sharp filters at the transmit and receive chains of each CR device. However, in practice, such an assumption is not feasible for low-cost hardware-constrained CR-capable IoT (CR-IoT) devices. Specifically, when a large number of CR-IoT devices are operating in the same vicinity, guard-band channels (GBs) are needed to mitigate the ACI problem, introducing GB adds constraints on the efficient use of spectrum and protocol design. In this paper, we develop a channel assignment mechanism for the hardware-constrained CR-IoT networks under time-varying channel conditions with GB-awareness. The objective of our assignment is to serve the largest possible number of CR-IoT devices by assigning the least number of idle channels to each device subject to rate demand and interference constraints. The proposed channel assignment in this paper is conducted on a per-block basis for the contending CR-IoT devices while considering the time-varying channel conditions for each CRIoT transmission over each idle channel, such that spectrum efficiency is improved. Specifically, our channel assignment problem is formulated as a binary linear programming problem, which is NP-hard. Thus, we propose a polynomial-time solution using a sequential fixing algorithm that achieves a suboptimal solution. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed assignment provides significant increase in the number of served IoT devices over existing assignment mechanisms. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Precision Agriculture (PA), as the integration of information, communication and control technologies in agriculture, is growing day by day. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. Nevertheless, their usage in this field is usually limited to specific scenarios of high cost, and they are not adapted to semi-arid conditions, or do not cover all PA management in an efficient way. For this reason, we propose a flexible platform able to cope with soilless culture needs in full recirculation greenhouses using moderately saline water. It is based on exchangeable low-cost hardware and supported by a three-tier open source software platform at local, edge and cloud planes. At the local plane, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) interact with crop devices to gather data and perform real-time atomic control actions. The edge plane of the platform is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA tasks near the access network to increase system reliability against network access failures. Finally, the cloud platform collects current and past records and hosts data analytics modules in a FIWARE deployment. IoT protocols like Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used to communicate with CPS, while Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI) is employed for southbound and northbound access to the cloud. The system has been completely instantiated in a real prototype in frames of the EU DrainUse project, allowing the control of a real hydroponic closed system through managing software for final farmers connected to the platform. © 2018 IAgrE},

abstract={Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing. © 2019, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

abstract={This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on ‘open design’ in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including ‘open hardware’): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself ‘making,’ manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In the last decades digital technologies have been employed in the field of cultural heritage for various purposes. Immersive visualization, digital reconstruction of archaeological sites and findings and virtual reality applications are only a few potential tools available when studying the past. The aim of this paper is to present the digital reconstruction of an archaic column, a research conducted at the Digital Media Lab, Technical University of Crete, in coordination with the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports. The 3D models of five very heavy parts of an archaic column were used for studying and virtually reconstructing the complete column. The column was part of an archaic temple unique in size and in type for the area of Chania, in West Crete, Greece. Structure from Motion technique was applied for the reproduction of high quality and accurate digital models of five sandstone drums. Specifically Agisoft Photoscan software was combined with fast, easy and low cost equipment. Furthermore our research team is currently investigating ways to utilize immersive reality for the reconstruction of the archaic column. The five 3D models that were produced with the SfM, are being uploaded as.obj files into Google Tilt Brush. Subsequently the user can experiment by moving, rotating and scaling the individual 3D parts in a 3D environment in real time, in Vive HTC, thus drastically simplifying the digital reconstruction process for similar projects. Finally, a hypothetical façade and a plan view of a similar archaic temple were transcribed in opaque sketches and imported in the immersive reality environment in order to serve as the canvas on which the 3D reconstruction of the column can take place in real scale. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={GNSS remains one of the key building blocks in mass-market positioning applications, many of which require a high level of accuracy, integrity and availability. Conventionally, the GNSS receiver and antenna are a part of a multisensor integrated solution with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) at the core of the navigation system. One of the multisensor fusion challenges is to continuously adjust the Kalman filter stochastic model to reflect the environment of operation. Apart from poor satellite geometry, the reception of multipath-contaminated signals is the main factor contributing to GNSS performance degradation in urban areas. Signal quality monitoring (SQM) techniques are implemented to first detect and then exclude, de-weight or correct the multipath-contaminated GNSS measurements to minimize the impact of multipath-induced errors on the multisensor data fusion filter performance. The implementation of such an approach for kinematic scenarios in deep urban canyons with mass-market hardware suffers from high rates of false-positive and false-negative multipath detection due to frequent cycle slips, discontinuous satellite tracking, and a complex multipath environment. The alternative approach for the IMU/GNSS integration filter stochastic model tuning is to extract the a priori statistics characterizing the probability of the multipath-contaminated signal reception from a GNSS multipath environment map. The map is generated with collectively recorded carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N0) readings streamed from the connected vehicles operating in a given urban area and assigned to a space-time cube. While improving positioning accuracy, the application of the concept is constrained by the GNSS multipath environment map availability only to the areas directly surveyed by the connected vehicles. The novel contributions of this paper are as follows. To extend availability of the GNSS multipath environment map, a random forest machine-learning model for predicting the spatial pattern of the map is developed. The model is trained with a real-world GNSS multipath environment map covering the area of ten square kilometres including downtown Montreal. A LiDAR elevation profile, 2D building polygons, street polygons, street types and foliage polygons are used as feature data. An 89% map prediction accuracy is reached. Further, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) stochastic model adjustment architecture combining the SQM multipath detection and the GNSS multipath environment map-aided multipath prediction is developed. The architecture aims to address the limitations of each method and allows for continuous multipath monitoring increasing the resilience of the multisensor data fusion. The method is tested in several use cases with low-cost hardware: loosely-coupled and tightly-coupled IMU/GNSS integration. The evaluation of the proposed method shows 20% positioning accuracy improvement compared to standard Kalman filter performance. The results of this work are expected to facilitate future improved integration of GNSS in multisensor platforms operating in challenging urban areas. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.},

abstract={Long-range (LoRa) radio technologies have recently gained momentum in the IoT landscape, allowing low-power communications over distances up to several kilometers. As a result, more and more LoRa networks are being deployed. However, commercially available LoRa devices are expensive and propriety, creating a barrier to entry and possibly slowing down developments and deployments of novel applications. Using open-source hardware and software platforms would allow more developers to test and build intelligent devices resulting in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry, and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. Toward this goal, this paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of KRATOS, a low-cost LoRa platform running ContikiOS.

Nowadays there are several available commercial solutions that can be used to validate the developed algorithms, but they are usually expensive and closed to hardware modifications. Another option is to build the robotic platform, but while these solutions are normally open hardware and can be easily modified and maintained, many are assembled using low cost components and are intended only for robot education, and for this reason are not suitable for advanced algorithm implementation nor can employ advanced sensors. A possible solution is presented in this paper, in which an open hardware modular omnidirectional platform is developed, with robust hardware implementation using modular commercially available components, at a lower cost that some more expensive available solutions, but with similar performance and capabilities being suitable for mobile robot research and experimentation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Optical stimulation of neural cells using optogenetic technique has become a hot research topic in neuroscience applications. One of the prominent challenges of applying the optogenetic technique is photostimulation tools that can provide stimulation patterns with high light intensity and desired temporal resolution. Hence, as the applications of this technique grow, there is a need for simple and low-cost hardware that can create stimulation patterns and control the light delivery onto target cells. In this paper, a photostimulation tool based on LED arrays for optical stimulation of Channelrhodopsin-expressing neurons is developed. The proposed photostimulator also benefit from a control panel that allows users to easily tune the stimulation parameters and stimulation patterns effectively. An in-vitro test platform has been used to validate the functionality of the designed optogenetic stimulation tool. The control panel of the designed stimulator allows researchers to manipulate stimulation patterns, adjust stimulation parameters and hence, adopt this test platform for various applications. © 2018 IEEE.},

The theoretical error performance is analyzed and compared with a practical implementation. Both synchrophasor estimators were implemented in a low cost hardware architecture proposed in the paper, with the purpose of showing the inherent estimator errors and the external error factors such as noise, quantization errors and sampling clock affected by jitter. In order to test the estimation algorithms, analysis under steady-state and dynamic conditions were performed. The tests were made under the conditions specified in the IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 and the total vector error of the algorithms was considered as the performance index. The studied and implemented algorithms were chosen by its nature, so one is based on frequency-domain analysis making an Interpolated-Discrete Fourier Transform and the other is based on time-domain analysis, implementing frequency mixing and a low pass FIR filter. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective assessment of taste perception is a challenging problem. In general, psychophysical tests based on the administration of a prototypical bitter compound, 6-n-propyltiouracil (PROP), and on a subjective scoring, are exploited. Since the PROP tasting ability is correlated to food preference and also to several clinical and health-related conditions, the development of low-cost hardware/software tools for accurate testing (e.g., in pharmacies) is an important goal. Previous works revealed the possibility to perform an electrophysiological measurement on the tongue able to provide objectiveness and repeatability in this kind of study. The technique, called Electrotastegram (ETG), relies on a custom thin-film electrode and an off-the-shelf electrophysiological recording system. In this work, we present a prototypical low-cost pocket-sized wireless device for ETG, comparing the signal quality against a top-class electrophysiological recording system already used for the same measurements. A custom Matlab interface was developed to collect and process the signal. By acquiring the signals at the same time with both devices, it was possible to compare the quality in terms of noise, amplitude and waveform. The results reveal a substantial equivalence between the two devices, thus opening to the possibility of using the proposed system in real scenarios, possibly substituting the Matlab interface with a stand-alone software. © 2018 IEEE.},

Until now, great care was required to make sure that each camera image was corresponding exactly the correct pattern in the sequence. This was difficult to achieve with low-cost hardware or large size installations. In our method, the projector sends a constant video loop of a selected number of unstructured light patterns at a high frame rate (30 to 60 fps for common hardware), which are captured by a camera without any form of synchronization. The only constraint to satisfy is that the camera and projector frame rates are known. The matching process not only recovers the correct pattern sequence, but is impervious to partial exposures of consecutive patterns as well as rolling shutter effects. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The core-shell polymeric nanofiber, owing to its better controlled release of embedded or encapsulated drugs in contrast with the single-compartment nanofibers, has been extensively studied for biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and wound healing. Electrospinning with co-axial needles is the dominant technique to fabricate nanofiber mat, however, associated with potential limitations such as high voltage requirement, costly equipment, slow deposition rate, required trained personal, not suitable in situ fabrication, and direct deposition of core-shell nanofibers on the wound at patient bedside. To address the above limitations, the work aims to introduce a novel co-axial airbrushing method to fabricate core-shell nanofibers using a simple setup and low-cost equipment, yet having a unique ability for fabrication at patient bedside and direct deposition on wound bed. Air-brush with a coaxial needle is designed to flow two different polymers solution with model biomolecules through core [PEO (polyethylene oxide)/poly-dl-lactide/PCL (polycaprolactone)] and shell (PCL/PEO) needle for the fabrication of the model core-shell nanofiber. Various processing parameters such as flow rate, air pressure, working distance, and concentration of polymer solution which affect the morphology of core-shell nanofibers were studied and found to have a prominent effect. The PCL-PEO nanofiber possesses a defined shell and core structure, tunable sustained release behavior of model proteins (bovine serum albumin and basic fibroblast growth factor; bFGF), and improved mechanical strength.

abstract={Soft wearable robots comprised of deformable materials have recently attracted much attention in the field of applications for its lightness and elasticity. However, there exist some limitation to the control of wearable robots due to the complexity of the model and the conditions of the wearer. In this paper, we propose a learning-based position control method of soft wearable glove using a deep neural network (DNN). To analyze our proposed method, we fabricated a soft pneumatic glove and a control board for the glove based on open hardware platform data. With our developed system, we collected the pressure and position data of the soft glove using a Leap Motion sensor to train our soft glove position network (SGPN). Along with our proposed DNN model, we could enable open-loop control on the joint positions of the soft glove by supplying pressure to the actuator without prior knowledge of the wearer or the wearable robot such as hand size of the wearer or the stiffness of pneumatic actuator. © ICROS.},

abstract={The trend towards highly-automated driver assistance systems strongly depends on the performance of environmental perception systems. Increasingly, greater attention is paid to sensor data modeling, because more measurement information can be gained with a good understanding of the hardware. Radar sensors are cost-efficient and thus often used for kinematic object tracking. Current techniques for the utilization of high-resolution radar sensors for object extent estimation, usually model the spatial occurrence of radar detections using statistical approximations. Although providing fast calculation speeds, the obtainable accuracy is not sufficient, especially when low-cost hardware is used. In this work, we propose a radar model which is based on approximations of every functional abstraction layer of radar sensors, from the electromagnetic wave distribution to the digital signal processing. This approach allows an inherent and generic modeling of the spatial detection probability of the environment, regardless of its exact content and avoiding any complexity issues. Consequently, the interaction between measurements of multiple vehicles can be accurately modeled. Additionally, various details like the antenna diagram and underbody reflections are included. The final radar model is evaluated and compared to measurement data. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, Edge computing has emerged as a new paradigm that can reduce communication delays over the Internet by moving computation power from far-end cloud servers to be closer to data sources. It is natural to shift the design of cloud-based IoT applications to Edge-based ones. Activity recognition in smart homes is one of the IoT applications that can benefit significantly from such a shift. In this work, we propose an Edge-based solution for addressing the activity recognition problem in smart homes from multiple perspectives, including: architecture, algorithm design and system implementation. First, the Edge computing architecture is introduced and several critical management tasks are also investigated. Second, a realization of the Edge computing system is presented by using open source software and low-cost hardware. The consistency and scalability of running jobs on Edge devices are also addressed in our approach. Last, we propose a convolutional neural network model to perform activity recognition tasks on Edge devices. Preliminary experiments are conducted to compare our model with existing machine learning methods, and the results demonstrate that the performance of our model is promising. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Enterprise networks' firewalls are rarely set up in a shared-protection (N:1) configuration, preferring instead the more costly active-stand by (1+1) configuration. This is due to, in part, to the high cost associated with software-based per-flow load balancing at high traffic loads. In this work, we propose the use of SDN/OpenFlow switches as a low-cost hardware-based alternative for subnet-level load balancing, for use in a N:1 firewall array. Our design guarantees that the N:1 system exhibits the same performance of a 1+1 system but at a much lower cost. In particular, the design provides lossless firewall handover of subnets in response to traffic bursts. A prototype of the system has been implemented in Python over the base of the Floodlight OpenFlow Controller and tested in our SDN Test-Bed using the ISPDSL II traffic traces, evaluating the behavior during traffic peaks. Initial results show that the system successfully migrate subnet traffic without packet losses, call blockings, or TCAM exhaustion. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Rapid advances of IC (Integrated Circuit) technology make the security be widely concerned. Traditional identity authentication protocols depend on binary secret key and encryption algorithm, and issues of complex computation and high cost exist in previous protocols. To realize a low-cost RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) identity authentication protocol, we propose a two-level arbiter PUF in RFID systems, which has advantages of less area, higher randomness and higher stability compared to that of traditional structure. In this work, a double PUF based bidirectional RFID identity authentication protocol is proposed on basis of the proposed PUF structure, aimed at providing authentication for IC, such as low-cost RFID system. The bidirectional authentication between the server and the tag is realized. In authentication, the dichotomy XOR operation and character padding are performed to the response of PUF, instead of making use the string matching method, which will not expose the response of PUF to the verifier. Experimental analysis shows that, the propose protocol can resist various malicious attacks and can be used in many low-cost hardware systems. © 2018 IEEE.},

The proposed scheme uses low-cost hardware built around a single DSP and a DC bench power supply to emulate PV panels which can be used to test other equipment such as grid-tied inverters, and/or MPPT controllers.

abstract={Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827° repeatability of 1.585° backlash error of 1.237° maximum speed of 35.156° and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33°. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant.

abstract={The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today’s society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={It has been identified from literature that affordability is the main constraint faced by the majority of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network) researchers which sees them forgoing implementing real world experimental studies that are costlier, in favour of opting for cheaper simulation tools instead. While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Automation in the agriculture system is essential these days. That is why this subject required special attentiveness. On comprehensive, this problem is solved with the help of satellite-based instruments. In the present case the monitoring system collects the agricultural parameters on a more regional level. This paper attempts to gather the data from various sensors using Wi-Fi technology with IoT, which comprises of Arduino Nano and esp8266-01. The realisation of data gathered by sensors (moisture in the soil, temperature of the soil, light intensity and humidity, status motor pump) based on open source hardware Arduino Nano. Some sensors (TSL2561, DS18B20) will directly provide the data (light intensity, temperature) to the Arduino Nano using I2C and one wire protocol respectively, while other sensors provides the raw data through Arduino Nano's 10-bit analogue to digital converter(ADC). Sensor data processed and communicated to esp8266-01(which act as a Wi-Fi node) incorporating request-send-acknowledgement method.Further esp82666-01 uploads the sensor information on blynk android IoT application and displayed on Graphical User Interface (GUI). The complete system is cost-effective and having low power consumption. IoT is used for update and alert to the farmers through an android application. The notification of irrigation events in the farm site is continuously updated to the farmer. The trials show that the present system works fine, and it is helpful for practical applications to the personalised low-cost agricultural parameter monitoring system. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Physiological (or biosignal) data acquisition and analysis has evolved from being intrinsically bound to medical practice or lab settings, to become a pervasive data source with numerous applications. This has been mostly leveraged by the proliferation of wearables and open hardware platforms. While the first devices offer good cloud connectivity (albeit to proprietary servers) but only provide high-level features, the latter have opposite characteristics, creating a gap in what concerns collaborative access to datasets for reuse in academic research. In this paper we describe a module devised to help bridge this gap, by enabling real-time biosignal streaming directly from an open hardware physiological data acquisition platform to a cloud-based repository over Wi-Fi. Performance tests have been made to assess the data transmission reliability, and the adopted approach to the repository enables user-friendly collaborative access, visualisation and sharing of the recorded data. © EURASIP 2018.},

Electromyographs can be very bulky and expensive. There are many alternatives to professional electromyographs, both commercial and academic. However, these options are still too expensive, have too few or a single channel. The objective of this work is to implement a low-cost multichannel surface EMG acquisition platform. The platform must have high-quality, scalability, analog-to-digital conversion and the possibility to run both in stand-alone mode and connected to a computer via USB interface. The proposed platform has three main components: dedicated acquisition board, Tiva module and acquisition software. We validate the proposed acquisition board design by testing its frequency response, circuit amplification and common mode rejection rate. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In developing state of the art applications for Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), most applications software and associated hardware are always developed from ground up. However, this approach always involves huge capital outlay, extend time-to-market for products, and contribute to integration delay, especially in the case of Industrial IoT (IIoT). In this paper, it is shown that already existing, widely-available, and low-cost hardware can participate successfully in collaborative computing for new analytics applications, at edges of IIoT and CPS networks. A well-known, low-cost, embedded digital signal processor (DSP) that is fully integrated in many industries is selected and used as a case study. The selected DSP is made more scalable by applying it to new, novel uses at the edge of an IIoT network. The new application includes using it to design useful waveforms needed for collaborative computing at IIoT network edges. Embedded-C, a programming language that is suitable for programming resource-constrained network edge devices is used to successfully design needed waveforms for the selected DSP. Collaborative computing is achieved by sending the designed waveforms from the network edge, across diverse communication channels, to the fog layer, and then, use it at the fog layer to remove noise in selected IIoT data. Correlation coefficient is positive and high between output of noise removal achieved by waveforms from the low-cost DSP when compared to noise removal achieved by waveforms from systems with more computing resources at the fog layer. This signifies a successful collaborative computing using such legacy, low-cost DSP. For low-cost hardware to participate successfully in distributed, real-time collaborative network edge-computing, impact of communication network disturbances must be examined. Hence, for the selected DSP, impact of network Bit Error Rate (BER) is examined for both wired and wireless networks. It is discovered that wireless channels have lesser BER than powerline communication (PLC) channels that have impulsive noises. Hence, it may be more suitable for real-time fault-tolerant collaborative computing using the selected DSP. © 2018 IEEE.},

The system is proved to be capable of overcoming the following state-of-the-art drawbacks: (i) the number of electrodes: a high number of electrodes increases the quality but is less comfortable for the user; (ii) the quality of the signal recorded in the scalp area of interest, typically covered with hair. At this aim, the authors propose: (i) the adoption of a single differential channel acquisition, in this case only three electrodes are used for the recording of the brain signal; (ii) the use of spring loaded pins electrodes in scalp area covered with hair to improve the contact and, as a consequence, the quality of recorded signal. The system as a whole is then tested on a group of people in order to validate its performance in terms of reached accuracy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts. © 2018 by the authors},

abstract={Challenges associated with developing analytics solutions at the edge of large scale Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks close to where data is being generated in most cases involves developing analytics solutions from ground up. However, this approach increases IoT development costs and system complexities, delay time to market, and ultimately lowers competitive advantages associated with delivering next-generation IoT designs. To overcome these challenges, existing, widely available, hardware can be utilized to successfully participate in distributed edge computing for IIoT systems. In this paper, an osmotic computing approach is used to illustrate how distributed osmotic computing and existing low-cost hardware may be utilized to solve complex, compute-intensive Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) deep learning problem from the edge, through the fog, to the network cloud layer of IIoT systems. At the edge layer, the C28x digital signal processor (DSP), an existing low-cost, embedded, real-time DSP that has very wide deployment and integration in several IoT industries is used as a case study for constructing real-time graph-based Coiflet wavelets that could be used for several analytic applications including deep learning pre-processing applications at the edge and fog layers of IIoT networks. Our implementation is the first known application of the fixed-point C28x DSP to construct Coiflet wavelets. Coiflet Wavelets are constructed in the form of an osmotic microservice, using embedded low-level machine language to program the C28x at the network edge. With the graph-based approach, it is shown that an entire Coiflet wavelet distribution could be generated from only one wavelet stored in the C28x based edge device, and this could lead to significant savings in memory at the edge of IoT networks. Pearson correlation coefficient is used to select an edge generated Coiflet wavelet and the selected wavelet is used at the fog layer for pre-processing and denoising IIoT data to improve data quality for fog layer based deep learning application. Parameters for implementing deep learning at the fog layer using LSTM networks have been determined in the cloud. For XAI, communication network noise is shown to have significant impact on results of predictive deep learning at IIoT network fog layer. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an all-in-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 × 31 × 26 cm 3 ), light (&lt;3 kg), and affordable (€810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one open-source system were made freely available at https://github.com/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Embedded networked sensor systems are deeply coupled with the physical world, and the deployed systems are usually difficult to debug. Therefore, it is especially important to thoroughly test and profile the systems before deploying to the real world. Traditional debugging methods are incompetent for detailed tracing on resource constrained devices due to their intrusiveness. This paper proposes a low-cost Hardware Assisted Tracing testBED (HATBED) to enable non-intrusive tracing and profiling for embedded networked sensor systems independent of operating systems and applications.

abstract={Despite a growing consensus that 3D printing technology has emerged as a revolutionary driver of innovation in society and has grown exponentially as an innovation ecosystem, our understanding of how the 3D printing ecosystem emerged and has grown is still limited. Based on the case study and the grounded theory approach, we found that four relevant platforms—open-source hardware platforms, online service platforms, free and low-cost 3D design software platforms, and crowdsourcing platforms—nurtured the innovation ecosystem. We also found that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently, we newly suggest “complementary multiplatforms,” a platform strategy that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. Our findings provide important theoretical grounds for the multiplatform strategy with complementary relationships aimed at facilitating the growth of an innovation ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Owning to the high operating temperature, excellent current carrying capacity, strong electro-mechanical properties and potential low-price, YBCO based the second generation high temperature superconducting tapes have great application prospects in the field of power system and magnetic applications. Fluorine-free organometallic decomposition technology is an environmentally friendly preparation route for YBCO deposition with a low-cost equipment investment and rapid crystal growth rate, and which is highlighted recently. YBCO thin films with thickness of 200 nm were prepared on CeO 2 /IBAD-MgO/Y 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 /Hastelloy C276 metal substrates by FF-MOD technique. The microstructures of BaCO 3 , YBCO and YBCO decomposition phases and their effects on superconductivity were systematically studied during high temperature phase formation. The experimental results show that the YBCO crystals are randomly oriented and gradually recrystallized into YBCO with biaxial texture during heat treatment, which is consistent with the results of single crystal. In addition, the key to the nucleation and growth of YBCO epitaxy is to control the sintering temperature and oxygen partial pressure in the sintering atmosphere, to inhibit the formation of BaCO 3 and avoid the partial decomposition of YBCO. © 2018, Chinese Ceramic Society.

abstract={The synthesis of three push-pull cationic dyes is reported here together with a photophysical study carried out by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. The hyperpolarizability (β) values of the three molecules have been estimated through a simple solvatochromic method based on conventional, low-cost equipment, which had been tested previously with success in our laboratory. The investigated pyridinium salts showing strong negative solvatochromism bear the same piperidine ring as a strong electron-donor group and the same thiophenes as electron-rich π-linkers, but differ in terms of the N-substituent on the electron-acceptor pyridinium unit, namely N-methyl in compound A, N-pyrimidin-2yl in B and N-2,4-dinitrophenyl in C. The derived β values were found to increase (in the order A<B<C) along with the increasing electron-acceptor strength of the pyridinium substituent, with the highest polarizability being estimated for the derivative bearing the strongest electron-withdrawing substituent dinitrobenzene. State-of-the-art femtosecond transient absorption measurements evidenced fast kinetics and dynamics in the singlet excited state in agreement with charge transfer (CT) processes promoted by excitation, with a proper ICT state observed in the case of C. This finding confirms the efficiency of photoinduced intramolecular CT as a significant factor that affects the NLO response. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={Purpose: To study the role of temperature in biological systems, diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (λ/4) stubs. Methods: The λ/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B 0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of −35.7dB/−41.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was −0.41dB/−0.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases.

abstract={Most studies of neural correlates of spatial navigation are restricted to small arenas (≤1 m2) because of the limits imposed by the recording cables. New wireless recording systems have a larger recording range. However, these neuronal recording systems lack the ability to track animals in large area, constraining the size of the arena. We developed and benchmarked an open-source, scalable multicam-era tracking system based on low-cost hardware. This “Picamera system” was used in combination with a wireless recording system for characterizing neural correlates of space in environments of sizes up to 16.5 m2. The Picamera system showed substantially better temporal accuracy than a popular commercial system. An explicit comparison of one camera from the Picamera system with a camera from the commercial system showed improved accuracy in estimating spatial firing characteristics and head direction tuning of neurons. This improved temporal accuracy is crucial for accurately aligning videos from multiple cameras in large spaces and characterizing spatially modulated cells in a large environment. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Studies of neural correlates of space are limited to biologically unrealistically small spaces by neural recording and position tracking hardware. We developed a camera system capable of tracking animals in large spaces at a high temporal accuracy. Together with the new wireless recording systems, this system facilitates the study of neural correlates of space at biologically relevant scale. This increased temporal accuracy of tracking also improves the estimates of spatiotemporal correlates of neural activity. © 2018 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Modern processors contain several specific hardware modules and multiple cores to ensure performance for a wide range of applications. In this context, FPGAs are frequently used as the implementation platform, since they offer architecture customization and fast time-to-market. However, many of them may not have the needed resources to implement all the necessary features, because of costs or complexity of the system to be implemented. When some needed functionalities do not fit in the target, they must be mapped into the much slower software domain. In this work, we exploit the fact these designs usually underuse their available BRAMs and propose a low-cost hardware-based function reuse mechanism for FPGAs, recovering some of the performance lost from the software part of applications that could not be implemented in hardware logic, with minimal impact on LUT usage. This is achieved by saving the inputs and outputs of the most frequently executed functions in a BRAM-based reuse table, so the next function executions with the same arguments can be skipped. This mechanism supports both precise and approximate modes and is evaluated with a 4-issue VLIW processor implemented in HDL, also considering a multi-core environment. Precise reuse, in single and multi-core scenarios, is assessed by running applications that use a software library to emulate floating point operations. Approximate reuse is evaluated over a single-core image-processing application that tolerates a certain level of error. Our scheme achieves 1.39 × geomean speedup in the precise single-core, while the multi-core case demonstrates application improvements from 1.25 × to 1.9 × when we start sharing the reuse table. In the approximate scenario, we achieve 1.52 × speedup with less than 10% error. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The investigation of seismic ambient noise (microtremor) in spectral ratio form, known as the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio technique, is extremely popular nowadays both to investigate large areas in a reduced amount of time, and to leverage a wider choice of low cost equipment. In general, measurements at multiple locations are collected to generate multiple, individual spectral ratio curves. Recently, however, there has been an increasing interest in spatially correlating informative content from different locations. Accordingly, we introduce a new computer program, “OpenHVSR – Processing Toolkit”, developed in Matlab (R2015b), specifically engineered to enhance data processing with the purpose of spatially correlating different forms of informative data content, creation of maps, and display of the results in 2D and 3D. The interface is designed to be user friendly while tightly binding processing and visualization so that the effects of different processing choices can be immediately evaluated. Further, bedrock mapping capability, as introduced by Ibs-von Seht and Wohlenberg (1999) is included both through the computation of bedrock depth via a set of published regressions or by computing a customized regression based on the data at hand. The program aims at implementing the most effective and desirable processing tools present in other commercial and non-commercial alternatives, all in one bundle, freely available to the scientific community. In addition to incorporating and enhancing currently available state of the art tools, we have integrated several original features that are not present in any other program. The presented processing toolkit naturally integrates with our data inversion software, “OpenHVSR”, published in 2016. Together, they constitute a complete workflow for the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio method. We expect this first version to be of great use to researchers and hope it will constitute the basis for further collaborative development toward future releases oriented at exploring the potentials of this technique. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education.

This paper provides a “Do It Yourself” (DIY) approach to produce graphically programmable robots with low cost components. The framework consists of the low-cost hardware components, back-end software and the visual programming editor to interface the hardware. The editor consists of interlocking graphical blocks to represent programming concepts such as Variables, Logical expressions, Conditions, Loops, Lists, Event Listeners, Parallel Programming and many more. Using this editor a student can graphically reprogram the robotics kit firmware and manipulate it.

abstract={Over the past several years, there has been a rise in online learning platforms and websites for skill acquisition. However, traditional learning analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of presented material are limited in that they do not acquire information regarding the user’s biophysical state during this learning process. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive system for evaluating online learners’ engagement and performance via electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, and behavioral data methods. Such information is of interest to (i) neuroscientists and psychologists aiming to quantify computerized learning processes and developing models to represent learning states, as well as to (ii) individuals designing educational content to better understand how information is accessed and utilized by users. We first describe the selection, design, and integration of the bio-signal components. We then demonstrate the combined utility of our system through recording signals while participants (N=22) completed German language lessons on the free web-based platform, Duolingo. As low-cost hardware is utilized in our system, data acquisition can readily be scaled to multiple research sites or remote collection, allowing for access to more naturalistic datasets not typically studied using traditional laboratory research systems. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Passive structures are augmented with actuators, sensors and control to implement the task of active noise or vibration reduction. Such systems are considered smart because they have advanced functionalities compared to conventional structures. A smart aircraft lining is able to reduce the low-frequency cabin noise induced by tonal or multi-tonal external noise sources. Such noise sources are for example fuel-efficient rotor engines like counter-rotating open rotors. Research on smart systems starts on a laboratory scale by using low-noise sensors and high-performance rapid control prototyping systems. The replacement of such costly and bulky laboratory hardware is one important precondition for the commercialization of smart structures. The increased internal noise, the reduced computational performance and other restrictions of low-cost hardware must be taken into account during the design of a smart system. Experimental results on the noise reduction of a smart lining with low-cost hardware show that a replacement of laboratory hardware will not lead to a loss of performance. The smart lining achieves tonal interior sound pressure level reductions of up to 25 dB with a mass increase of only 2 percent. Even a mass neutral implementation seems possible, if conventional loudspeaker-driven passenger announcements are realized with smart linings. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Suborbital missions of sounding rockets along the parabolic trajectory are commonly used for the Earth's near space environment research or for the astrophysical observations with the time duration only in the order of several minutes. Such short-term missions are usually performed with a low-cost equipment as the exact opposite of long-term satellite missions with high-end and expensive technologies. In this paper there is described the usage of a low-cost industrial CMOS camera for the confirmation of accurate pointing of the Roentgen telescope during the Vela supernova observation. It requires a robust method of the image post-processing and the compensation of real properties of the camera system faced to the extreme space environment. Also a specific mode of the image acquisition is required due to temperature changes during the suborbital mission. As the result of our work, a low-cost camera could be used for simple and short-term tasks in space instead of an expensive space qualified system. © 2018 University of West Bohemia.},

abstract={We present an open hardware and software platform to efficiently fuse heterogeneous sensor data in an automotive/robotic context. The framework presented in this paper provides researchers a base platform in order to develop and evaluate sensor fusion strategies. In contrast to similar approaches, this framework exploits in particular the raw radar data and enables the fusion at low-level. The proposed system utilizes low-level data from radar sensors as well as indirect (e.g. 3D imaging) and direct (e.g. LIDAR) Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors. After a configurable amount of pre-processing at sensor-level, the sensor data is transferred to a centralized platform and aligned temporally and spatially. We demonstrate the transformation of radar data into the 3D coordinate system in order to fuse it with point cloud data from ToF sensors. Due to the modular structure of the framework, it also enables the exploration of various system partitioning concepts. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop a low cost open source Controller Area Network system that simulates electronic controls in modern automotive vehicles and to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching aid. The Arduino UNO microcontroller board was chosen as the desired hardware platform and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the Arduino compiler was chosen as the software development environment. Both the Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE/compiler are open source and freely available to students and staff with no proprietary intellectual property costs. The Arduino UNO was interfaced with the Arduino Controller Area Network Bus (CANBus) shield which is also open hardware. Unitec Institute of Technology practices a holistic approach to teaching. As part of its holistic approach to teaching, senior students are encouraged to develop technical artefacts that can be used as teaching aids for junior students, the junior students are introduced to the artefact as part of their course and the artefact is used to encourage junior students to increase their technical proficiency so that when they reach a senior technical level they can develop artefacts too. The holistic approach is considered to be self-sustaining and provides positive role modelling for junior students. The project described in this paper was developed by a senior student and has been used as a teaching aid for junior students congruent with the holistic teaching philosophy practiced at Unitec. The code and circuitry was designed by an exchange Masters student and was used in the papers, APTE 7504 Vehicle Electronic Diagnostics and APTE 6505 Automotive Electronics, to help students understand CANBus operation and design features in an Automotive CANBus application. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Although inertial navigation based orientation finding is completely autonomous, its real-time performance is limited by the accuracy of gyro, and the cost is very high, which is not suitable for low cost applications. An attitude determination system compose of rotation mechanism and multiple Beidou receivers is proposed, which have the advantages from both inertial system and GNSS system. It is a low cost attitude determination system for low dynamic applications. A rotary encoder is used to provide the rotation speed information and modulated relative rotation angle information, with this information the output from Beidou attitude determination algorithm can be filtered and screened. By discriminate the common mode system error and differential system error, environment dependent effects such as multipath can be minimized, the accuracy of static attitude determination can be improved with data of multiple epochs. A prototype of the system had been built and shown. The data were collected and analyzed. The results show that real-time north finding with high accuracy can be achieved based on the low cost hardware design, the dependence of the heading performance with environment for Beidou system is reduced. A heading performance of 0.04deg was demonstrated. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={Big Data growth does not stop. Companies are forced to store data without knowing its value or usage because data has potential to become next revenue opportunity. Since the cost for storing data increases as the amount of data grows, efficient data storage methods are required. We introduce a method to reduce the cost of data storage by partial decluttering of image and video data. In our method, only the portions of image or video files containing recognized objects are extracted. This is based on the assumption that images of objects of interest may be used in the future, but other image data, such as the background, can be discarded. We use the neural network computer stick from Intel Corporation to accelerate the computation. In the case study of a video file, our method successfully reduced the data size by approximately 50% on average. In addition to that, we realized a low-cost method that can be applied not only to large companies but also small to medium companies by using a low cost hardware accelerated implementation. We interviewed experts in corporate IT data management and qualitatively demonstrated that our method is valuable and eflective. Our research has contributed to IT managements' decision-making support to resolve their data storage vs. cost problem. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

abstract={In order to assist researchers explore the full potential of distributed recycling of post-consumer polymer waste, this article describes a recyclebot, which is a waste plastic extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing filament. The device design takes advantage of both the open source hardware methodology and the paradigm developed by the open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer community. Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot's ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than $700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24 h. Filament is produced at 0.4 kg/h using 0.24 kWh/kg with a diameter ±4.6%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250 °C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Three types of highly-customizable open source probe positioning systems are evaluated: (a) mostly 3-D printed, (b) partially printed using OpenBeam kinematic constraints, and (c) a 3-level stack of low-cost commercial single axis micropositioners and some printed parts. All systems use digital distributed manufacturing to enable bespoke features, which can be fabricated with RepRap-class 3-D printer and easily accessible components. They are all flexible in material choice for custom components. The micropositioners can be set up for left-right use and flat or recessed configurations using either mechanical or magnetic mounting. All systems use a manual probe holder that can be customized and enable a quick swap probe system. System (a) is purchased for $100 or fabricated for <$5, (b) fabricated for $25, and (c) fabricated for $145. Each full turn of a knob moves an axis 0.8 mm for (a) and 0.5 mm for (b, c) providing externally measured positional control of 10 µm for the latter. All three designs can utilize a customizable probe holder and tungsten carbide needle for $56. The designs are validated using microchips with known feature sizes and underwent mechanical stress tests. The maximal deflection of (a) was >200 µm, (b) 40 µm and (c) 10 µm. A tradeoff is observed for 3-D printed percent between cost and accuracy. All systems provided substantial cost savings over proprietary products with similar functionality. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Locomotor activity in rodents is routinely assessed in the evaluation of drugs and other behavioural studies. Several proprietary lab equipment are available to measure locomotion, however their prohibitive cost may pose a challenge to newly-established and poorly funded labs. To overcome this challenge we present Actifield, an open source hardware setup to measure locomotor activity in rodents. The design consists of 3D printed and laser-cut parts as well as “off-the-shelf” electronic components. Here we demonstrate that rodent locomotor activity can be recorded using the IR motion detection system employed in Actifield. Moreover, we show in validation experiments that this hardware system is comparable to commercial and open source video tracking systems. Actifield would be particularly useful to labs in need of a reliable and inexpensive equipment that can be easily built. © 2018 The Authors},

The goal is to allow people with motor disabilities to play a serious game and improve control over their oculomotor systems. The developed system consists of three subsystems: a low-cost hardware device to acquire the EOG signals, methods to process them digitally, and a serious game controlled exclusively by eye movements. Fourteen able-bodied volunteers of different ages and genders tested the computer game.

abstract={Critical to maintaining quality control in high-throughput screening is the need for constant monitoring of liquid-dispensing fidelity. Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures. © 2018 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.},

Thus, it allows to optimize the potential waveform for the particular GUV’ composition. We also describe the design of a low cost, reusable chamber with stainless steel electrodes that allows using very small volumes of solution (0.3 mL). With this chamber, a larger number of GUVs were generated in less electroformation times compared to ITO electrodes. The general characteristics of the obtained GUVs are comparable to those electroformed in platinum or ITO surfaces. The chamber, combined with the wave generator comprises a simple, reusable, programmable and low cost system for the formation of GUVs. © 2018 The Authors},

The hardware design is flexible in order to host extra sensors via I2C bus and easy replacement of microcontroller and sensors in the event of either malfunctions or substitution with newer versions. The device is programmable using the Arduino IDE. The data are sent to an IoT platform that allows real-time visualization, analyses, and download. Tests were performed in laboratory and at the Casa de Convalescencia in Vic (Spain), by monitoring the microenvironment of an exhibition cabinet hosting 18th century ceramics. The results achieved are promising: the open hardware and software approach allows plan further implementations and provides a solid base for device customizations; in terms of technology applied to Cultural Heritage, the implementation of open hardware does not only can lower significantly the costs, but also provides scientifically reliable alternatives to off the shelf technology, as well as enhances end-users capability to develop customized devices that can better address specific needs. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Laboratory automation improves test reproducibility, which is vital to patient care in clinical laboratories. Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path length compensations. © 2018 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.},

abstract={Several digital technologies are nowadays developed and applied to the study of the human fossil record. Here, we present a low-cost hardware implementation of the digital acquisition via photogrammetry, applied to a specimen of paleoanthropological interest: the Neanderthal skull Saccopastore 1. Such implementation has the purpose to semi-automatize the procedures of digital acquisition, by the introduction of an automatically rotating platform users can easily build on their own with minimum costs. We provide all the technical specifications, mostly based on the Arduino UNO™ microcontroller technology, and evaluate the performance and the resolution of the acquisition by comparing it with the CT-scan of the same specimen through the calculation of their shape differences. In our opinion, the replication of the automatic rotating platform, described in this work, may contribute to the improvement of the digital acquisition processes and may represent, in addition, a useful and affordable tool for both research and dissemination. © 2018 IMEKO.},

abstract={A key challenge when displaying and processing sensed real-time 3D data is efficiency of generating and post-processing algorithms in order to acquire high quality 3D content. In contrast, our approach focuses on volumetric generation and processing volumetric data using an efficient low-cost hardware setting. Acquisition of volumetric data is performed by connecting several Kinect v2 scanners to a single PC that are subsequently calibrated using planar pattern. This process is by no means trivial and requires well designed algorithms for fast processing and quick rendering of volumetric data. This can be achieved by fusing efficient filtering methods such as Weighted median filter (WM), Radius outlier removal (ROR) and Laplace-based smoothing algorithm. In this context, we demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our technique by sensing several scenes. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus is on the “design global, manufacture local” model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a “design global, manufacture local” model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. “Design global, manufacture local” may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Crane posture estimation is the stepping stone to forest machine automation. Here, we introduce a robust minimal perception solution, that is, one that uses minimal constraints for maximal benefits. Specifically, we introduce a robust particle-filter-based method to estimate and track the posture of a flexible hydraulic crane by using only low-cost equipment, namely, a two-dimensional (2D) laser scanner, two short magnetically attached metal tubes as targets, and an angle sensor. An important feature of our method is that it incorporates control signals for hydraulic actuators. In contrast to the previous works employing laser scanners, we do not use the full shape of the crane to estimate the crane posture, but, instead, we use only two small targets in the field of view of the laser scanner. Thus, a large share of the range data is useful for other purposes, for example, to map the surrounding environment. We test the proposed method in a challenging forest environment and show that the particle filter is able to estimate the posture of the hydraulic crane efficiently and reliably in the presence of occlusions and obstructions. During our comprehensive testing, the tip position was measured with average errors smaller than 4.3 cm whereas the absolute maximum error was 15 cm. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Understanding how neurons encode and compute information is fundamental to our study of the brain, but opportunities for hands-on experience with neurophysiological techniques on live neurons are scarce in science education. Here, we present Spikeling, an open source in silico implementation of a spiking neuron that costs £25 and mimics a wide range of neuronal behaviours for classroom education and public neuroscience outreach. Spikeling is based on an Arduino microcontroller running the computationally efficient Izhikevich model of a spiking neuron. The microcontroller is connected to input ports that simulate synaptic excitation or inhibition, to dials controlling current injection and noise levels, to a photodiode that makes Spikeling light sensitive, and to a light-emitting diode (LED) and speaker that allows spikes to be seen and heard. Output ports provide access to variables such as membrane potential for recording in experiments or digital signals that can be used to excite other connected Spikelings. These features allow for the intuitive exploration of the function of neurons and networks mimicking electrophysiological experiments. We also report our experience of using Spikeling as a teaching tool for undergraduate and graduate neuroscience education in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. © 2018 Baden et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.},

abstract={This study presents an entirely open-source, low-cost power monitoring system capable of many types of measurements including both loads and supplies such as solar photovoltaic systems. In addition, the system can be fabricated using only open source software and hardware. The design revolves around the Digital Universal Energy Logger (DUEL) Node, which is responsible for reading and properly scaling the voltage and current of a particular load, and then serializing it via an on-board ATTiny85 chip. The configuration of the DUEL node allows for custom sensitivity ranges, and can handle up to 50 A and 300 V. Up to 127 DUEL nodes communicate via Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) on a bus, which can be monitored and logged through an Arduino UNO, or other compatible microcontroller. Using accessible equipment, the DUEL node can be calibrated to a desirable accuracy and error. The DUEL nodes are also completely customizable, making them fit for any input range, where all commercially-available products are fixed range. The open source solution out performs commercial solutions as the price per measurement ($18.25) is significantly smaller, while the number of serviceable channels (1 2 7) is significantly higher. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The recent emergence of open hardware platforms has drastically reduced the cost required to develop special purpose device architectures. The RISC-V instruction set and associated ecosystem is one such architecture that has become widely popular as the basis for the next generation embedded control systems and IoT devices. Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is currently very little support for performing architectural experiments of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the RISC-V instruction set. The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms and applications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

This is done by generating a series of generic functions under high level programming languages, making it possible to develop high complexity algorithms. The standard's main requirement for its implementation, is the use of a control device with an embedded software. The research presents a low-cost hardware reutilization, based on the develop under IEC-61499 standard of a control function encapsulating a MPC algorithm and communication functions that allow a development card Raspberry Pi 3B to take full control of the Programmable Logic Controller's (PLC) operation involved in the pump control of an oil pipeline pumping station, making it possible to combine the physical strengths of a PLC with the processing capabilities of an embedded controller. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Because of the great popularity of the maker movement, the concept of 'Do it yourself' (DIY) has gained considerable public attention. Furthermore, because of the development of rapid prototyping, the rise of open-source hardware and programming languages, the popularization of network communities, and the establishment of maker spaces, DIY has been taken to the next level: 'co-creation.' This concept requires reform to the standard curriculum in information and technology education. Therefore, this study aims to define the key competences of makers to construct the competence indicators of Maker Education for information and technology education in elementary school. On this basis, a curriculum can be developed, and an evaluation system for learning effectiveness can be built to equip students with the abilities to adapt to life and tackle challenges. In this study, the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) was applied to collect and analyze data in the form of a questionnaire survey. The subjects were 12 experts from enterprises, governmental institutions, schools and research institutes. The research achievements include 3 factors ('Theoretical knowledge,' 'Practical application,' 'Maker's mindset'), and 10 indicators. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={We investigate the practical realization of energy beamforming gains in the downlink wireless power transfer from a massive antenna radio frequency (RF) source to multiple single antenna energy harvesting (EH) users. Assuming channel reciprocity for the uplink and downlink channels undergoing Rician fading, we first obtain the least-squares and linear-minimum-mean-square-error channel estimates using the energy-constrained pilot signal transmission from EH users. Due to the usage of low cost hardware at the users and for realizing massive antenna system at the RF source, these estimates are strongly influenced by the transmitter and receiver in-phase-and-quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI). Using these channel estimates, we next derive the harvested power at each user by applying the source transmit precoding that maximizes the sum harvested power among the users. Selected results generated considering practical RF EH system parameters show that IQI and channel estimation errors can lead to about 30% degradation in the sum EH performance. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={As a growing number of companies reject intellectual property (IP) monopoly-based business models to embrace libre product development of free and open source hardware and software, there is an urgent need to refurbish the instruments of university-corporate research partnerships. These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research. Under the SLRA, university researchers can spend more time innovating for the same investment. © 2018 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Barriers to inventing electronic devices involve challenges of iterating electronic designs due to long lead times for professional circuit board milling or high costs of commercial milling machines. To overcome these barriers, this study provides open source (OS) designs for a low-cost circuit milling machine. First, design modifications for mechanical and electrical subsystems of the OS Distributed 3-D (D3D) Robotics prototyping system are provided. Next, Copper Carve, an OS custom graphical user interface, is developed to enable circuit board milling by implementing backlash and substrate distortion compensation. The performance of the OS D3D circuit mill is then quantified and validated for: positional accuracy, cut quality, feature accuracy, and distortion compensation. Finally, the return on investment is calculated for inventors using it. The results show by properly compensating for motion inaccuracies with Copper Carve, the machine achieves a motion resolution of 10 microns, which is more than adequate for most circuit designs. The mill is at least five times less expensive than all commercial alternatives and the material costs of the D3D mill are repaid from fabricating 20–43 boards. The results show that the OS circuit mill is of high-enough quality to enable rapid invention and distributed manufacturing of complex products containing custom electronics. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.

abstract={This paper proposes a novel algorithm of predictive torque control (PTC) for induction motor based on discrete space vector modulation (DSVM). DSVM technique increases the number of voltage vectors, which must be evaluated in the PTC method. This new technique is called PTC-DSVM, which presents a low sampling frequency. However, the high number of virtual vectors increases computational burden significantly. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a novel algorithm that reduces the number of admissible voltage vectors, based on the well-known direct torque control switching table, is presented. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that proposed PTC-DSVM has the same behavior as conventional PTC at the same switching frequency while the sampling frequency is three times lower. The low sampling frequency of the proposed algorithm makes it suitable for industries to use low-cost hardware or perform a high computational analysis. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a control platform developed to interface with various hardware, allowing the design and rapid implementation even of advanced controllers, both on academic and industrial systems. The code of the controllers is written in the open-source Python language, facilitating the translation of code usually written in commercial software. The proposed platform can use from Arduinos to Programmable Logic Computers (PLCs). Beyond the research and tests on industrial facilities, the simplicity of the proposed platform allows its use also for educational and training purposes. Therefore, the proposed platform can help students focus on system analysis and control theory instead of hardware interfacing issues, while using low cost hardware. Developed in a client-server scheme, the platform can run in affordable computers while taking advantage of high-level mathematical and graphical tools available in Python language, allowing rapid implementation of advanced controllers. The use of this platform is illustrated with an implementation of a model predictive control (MPC) of a level control in a laboratory-scale process. A PLC is used to take the level measures, to dispatch control signals, and also for interlocking secure tasks. The controller runs on a Raspberry Pi computer that communicates with the PLC through an ethernet link. © 2012-2018 ICI Bucharest.},

abstract={OMV Austria E&P GmbH operates approximately 650 artificially lifted oil wells with an average water cut (WC) of 96% in the area of lower Austria. The majority of these wells produce with sucker rod pumps (SRP - 76%), gas lift (GL-16%) and electrical submersible pumps (ESP - 8%). Especially well interventions for equipment replacement due to corrosion, associated gas and sand production, represent the main cost drivers for operating expenditures for mature fields. Current commodity prices are the main driving force behind cost-centric strategies, where cost efficient equipment optimization is the key to improve run life. The challenge is to extend the run life of the artificial lift system without adverse effects on the oil production rates. The foundation for any low cost equipment optimization is built on detailed in-house failure analysis. Therefore the existing inspection procedures of SRPs and GL in the own pump workshop were revised; additionally a workflow for ESPs was initiated and implemented. Based on the results of these measures the most frequent failure reasons were identified and possible mitigations were analysed. The measures include design modifications, a stricter quality assurance of new equipment, material upgrades and special parts for the respective production environment. The continuous study has already improved the run life significantly, thereby reducing the amount of well interventions and deferred production. The new integrated approach of failure analysis, design adaptions and quality assurance offered valuable information to prevent recurrent systematic equipment failures. © 2018 EID Energle Informationsdienst GmbH.},

abstract={We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Localization of eddy current probe in Nondestructive Testing allows merging the information of defect detection with positions. Typically, this task requires the usage of additional and costly position measurement systems or software assisted handlers in controlled laboratory conditions. However, many of these tests require free hand movements of the eddy current probes. In addition, in many industrial applications low cost is a stringent requirement. This paper proposes a novel solution to comply with the proposed issues. In particular, the paper describes the usage of a magnetic 2D wireless localization method, able to track the probe position during the execution of Nondestructive Tests. To the best of our knowledge, such approach is novel and promises to accomplish the localization issue in Nondestructive Testing by means of low-cost hardware. Moreover, it is characterized by a light computational burden, since it reuses most of the equipment already needed for the test itself. Preliminary results, proving the suitability of a real time simultaneous testing and localization system, are reported in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.},

The testbed provides the ability to autonomously control multiple small vehicles within a 1200×900 mm environment and is entirely open source with regard to both hardware and software, making it easily reproducible. An agent-based approach is used for vehicle control, meaning that different agent models can be applied to each vehicle as desired for simulation.

abstract={This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much as possible on open hardware. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Microcontrollers are programmable, integrated circuit chips. In the last two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously, the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a dreadful "chip-in-a-lab"-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future perspectives. © 2018 by the authors.},

This would lead to a new trajectory for IT product development which could even increase the efficiency of addressing novel types of hardware-oriented attacks or employing stealthy hardware features. This could require increased transparency of semiconductor fabs. For designing open hardware several nuclei already exist. The proposed path would hold particular promise for security-critical components, which could be specified in such a way as to precisely match hardware characteristics. As some components would continue to be built using existing components for some time, a generalized a priori statement about the security of the complete supply chain, such as 'verified' or 'proven', will initially be impossible. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The OS scheduler's memory and runtime overheads form crucial design constraints for embedded systems implemented on low-cost hardware platforms. Table-driven scheduling can provide a high level of schedulability; however, it also consumes significant amounts of memory. By contrast, effective non-preemptive scheduling policies, such as the non-work-conserving Critical-Window EDF (CW-EDF), have low memory usage, but substantial runtime overheads. This paper aims to achieve efficient and effective non-preemptive scheduling by using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scheduling policy combined with a novel offset tuning technique. This technique enables the FIFO policy to reproduce a given feasible schedule, such as that followed by CW-EDF, resulting in a high level of schedulability, combined with comparatively low runtime overheads. Further, by using a small number of offsets per task, memory overheads are also tightly constrained. The proposed solution is evaluated in terms of runtime overhead, memory consumption, and schedulability ratio, using a prototype implementation on an Arduino board. This shows that FIFO with offset tuning can match the schedulability ratio of CW-EDF, while typically exhibiting lower scheduling overheads and memory consumption than the state-of-the-art Offline Equivalence technique, which is based on Non-Preemptive Fixed Priority (NP-FP) scheduling. © 2018 IEEE.},

Arduino, another type of open source hardware, is used as the node controller of the control system.

The dedicated communication modem utilizes IoT technology and can deliver this data from remote regions. The S3ME2 has been designed as a low-cost instrument to facilitate the production of multiple units. During the pilot phase, it has demonstrated continuous operability for up to 6 months, including survival during extremely cold, snowy, and low insolation, and low wind periods in the Sub-Arctic region. With its robust design, S3ME2 exploits the use of renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind power to power the system. The S3ME2 has also been designed from a modular point of view with commercial off the shelf components (COTS) and open source hardware, considering long term operability of the station. The sensor modules can be easily added, replaced, or upgraded such that a stable functioning of the system is guaranteed. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Smart Grid, also known as the next generation of the power grid, is considered as a power infrastructure with advanced information and communication technologies (ICT) that will enhance the efficiency and reliability of power systems. For the essential benefits that come with Smart Grid, there are also security risks due to the complexity of advanced ICT utilized in the architecture of Smart Grid to interconnect a huge number of devices and subsystems. Cybersecurity is one of the emerging major threats in Smart Grid that needs to be considered as the attack surface increased. To prevent cyber-attacks, new techniques and methods need to be evaluated in a real-world environment or in a testbed. However, the costs for setting-up Smart Grid testbed is extensive. In this article, we focused on the development of a Smart Grid testbed with a low-cost hardware and software for cybersecurity research and education. As a case study, we evaluated the testbed with most common cyber-attack such as denial of service attack. In addition, the testbed is a useful resource for cybersecurity research and education on different aspects of SCADA systems such as protocol implementation, and PLC programming. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Biodiesel has a potential not completely exploited as substitute of diesel oil, despite it is known as biodegradable, nontoxic, and has a low-emission profile. The aim of this paper is to propose an ultrasonic method as a tool for real-time monitoring transesterification reactions by using low-power ultrasound based on a pulse/echo scheme. Two catalytic routes were tested, both using degummed soybean oil as source and KOH as catalyser. The difference between catalytic routes was the type of alcohol used (methanol and ethanol). Three different reaction times were studied: 10, 20, and 30 min. Low power (less than 100 mW) ultrasonic time-gated bursts were applied to the reactional media at 1 MHz. The eco was measured during the reaction, and small amounts of the reaction media were collected every 2 min for chemical analysis. Time of flight and echo waveform amplitude were the ultrasonic parameter of interest. The amplitude of the ultrasonic waveform was related with the variation of the ethanol-transesterification reaction rate and could help in qualitatively monitoring that reaction. Furthermore, density measurements where consistent with the variations observed on time of flight, confirming the possibility of monitoring the reaction using ultrasonic parameters. The behaviour of the ultrasonic parameters varied depending on the alcohol and the presence or not of heating during the reaction. As a common rule, the stabilization of the ultrasonic parameters indicates that the maximum yield for each catalytic route is achieved, indicating that the reaction should be stopped for maximum energy efficiency. Results disclose that the proposed method is a feasible way to monitor the reactions of biodiesel during its production, in real time, and with relatively low-cost equipment. Further development shall be done to use it in industrial scale, mainly regarding the ultrasound power and frequency to be employed. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={In wireless sensor networks, sensor deployment is an important issue in which sensors are deployed in a specific monitoring region using low-cost hardware but achieving high coverage quality. In recent years, several mechanisms have been developed for the efficient robotic deployment of sensors. Their performance levels are highly dependent on unknown obstacles that can give rise to the dead-end problem. A key challenge when developing a robot deployment mechanism is to overcome the dead-end problem and deliver full coverage with a minimal number of sensors. This paper proposes an impasse-aware robot deployment (IAD) algorithm. The proposed IAD mainly consists of basic deployment rules and dead-end handling rules. The basic deployment rules are intended to achieve full coverage with a minimal number of sensors; the proposed dead-end handling rules can efficiently resolve the dead-end problem. Extensive experimental studies have demonstrated that our proposed IAD achieves superior performance to that of existing robot deployment mechanisms with respect to coverage ratio, energy efficiency, deployment path length, and required stack space. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents three lifting structures of Daubechies-8 (also known as D8) wavelet transform using efficient factorization of the polyphase matrix. All new filter coefficients are optimally mapped with integers resulting in low cost hardware implementation. We first derive the polyphase matrices using a factorization algorithm, which forms the basis of multiple lifting structures of D8. A theoretical framework is then derived and proven experimentally to eliminate the scaling stage of the algorithm that incurs computation error in conventional integer-based wavelets. This elimination of the scaling stage makes the proposed architecture lossless. Also due to the optimum integer mapping, the 8-bit implementation of our schemes produces very similar results than that of the classical double-precision D8 filter. Finally, we compare our results with other existing lifting wavelets to demonstrate the advantage in terms of lower cost, losslessness and improved performance. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Advancement of low-cost hardware capable of processing multimedia data coupled with efficient short range radio communication has led to the development of Wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). We consider post-disaster situation analysis application where the nodes in a WMSN capture disaster images from the affected area. Energy is one of the scarcest resources for such a network especially for disaster application where power supply for charging the battery of a node is nearly impossible. In this paper we exploit such facts and propose an energy saving multimedia (image) data processing scheme for its subsequent transmission over energy-constrained WMSN. Unlike conventional image processing, it saves energy by reducing the data to be transmitted at the cost of segmentation-less adaptive compression. Finally, the comparative performance of the scheme shows its dominance over all the competing schemes. Precisely, our scheme saves on an average 34% energy over all the competing schemes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The capabilities of this platform allow both, researchers and students, to implement from basic techniques to complex ones (e.g., from model-based control techniques to multiagent dynamical systems). The hardware that has been designed and developed performs experiments for single or multiple robot control employing capabilities, such as locomotion, communication, perception, and autonomous decision making. We illustrate different control and system dynamics techniques using this platform. After presenting the model and navigation strategies, single-agent techniques that ensure safe and predictable navigation are shown (PID and fuzzy logic controllers). Then, two multiagent techniques are described in order to prove the versatility of the platform. The first strategy illustrates common problems that arise in nature and power systems (phase synchronization models based on pulse-coupled biological oscillators and the Kuramoto oscillator). Second, a game theoretical approach for multirobot consensus is shown. In all these cases, experimental results show the performance of the platform. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce Dimitri, an open-software & open-hardware humanoid robot with 31 DOFs, fitted with cost-effective modular compliant joints and parallel link legs, designed for advanced human-robot interaction research, force-informed object handling and intelligent environment discovery. Our main innovation is in the design of a robust full-body biped humanoid robot equipped with very low-cost polyurethane torsional spring fixed to traditional servo motors and a circuit to measure angular displacement, transforming the system into a series elastic actuator (SEA). In order to illustrate the robot’s qualities in the field of machine learning applied to robotics and manipulation, a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN) is implemented, allowing the robot to replicate combined movement sequences earlier taught via interactive demonstration. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a complete on-line condition monitoring system (CMS) designed to detect incipient broken rotor bar (BRB) fault in double-cage induction motor (DCIM) using the stator current signature. The novelty of this paper lies in the successful combination of one of the latest variants of wavelet techniques, the recursive stationary wavelet packet transform and the widely used tool in quality control, the statistical process control (SPC) in order to deal with several challenges in the continuous monitoring of incipient BRB fault. In fact, breakage in outer bars (OBs) of a DCIM is known to be less prone to exhibit fault signature in the stator current than that of a single-cage IM, especially during the steady motor operation mode. Furthermore, on-line CMSs should at the same time act at normal motor operating mode, including steady and transient modes and be reconfigurable with no motor size dependence. The complete on-line CMS was designed and implemented in a low-cost hardware environment and was validated with 3-kW DCIM featuring incipient OB faults. A 100% fault detection accuracy starting from 3-mm OB breakage during normal motor operating mode, with the autolearning fault threshold, demonstrates the reliability and flexibility of the proposed system. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts’ behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital “Raymundo Abarca Alarcón,” constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={In transportation cyber-physical systems (TCPS), data are collected from different transportation modes and from a wide variety of data collection devices. TCPS data have characteristics that can be described using '5Vs of big data': (1) volume, (2) variety, (3) velocity, (4) veracity and (5) value (Demchenko et al., 2013) Volume represents the raw amount of data to be stored. Velocity represents the rate at which data are being collected and inserted into the data infrastructure and how fast the back end services are expected to process these data streams. The variety aspect arises from the fact that in a data-driven environment, it is inevitable for service providers to collect and combine data from numerous different sources for creating actionable insights. As a result, data will come into the infrastructure under different data formats. With increases in data size, rate of data arrival and number of data sources, the reliability of data contents will certainly decrease. This is the veracity aspect. The final V, value, represents the desired outcome for investing in TCPS data, because all efforts are for nought if usable insights cannot be generated from the data. All of these characteristics make traditional database management systems and conventional data processing and delivery systems inappropriate for many types of transportation data analysis and decision support tasks. An enormous amount of heterogeneous data cannot be processed in real time. This chapter introduces the modern data infrastructures that are needed to support TCPS. The focus is on open-source hardware and software technologies that support data management and delivery systems. The chapter also includes a discussion of infrastructure as code that can leverage emerging commercial cloud facilities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There are over 4,500 institutions of higher education in the United States, of those over 1,800 are Bachelor degree granting institution [1]. If 1 in 20 has a campus observatory, that is still nearly 200 small telescopes spread across the country. While certainly the sites are less than ideal and many campus telescopes will be small, ~30-40 cm in diameter, this number of telescopes is still significant and could be especially useful for transient studies in the LSST era. The educational and outreach impact of having robotic observatories at educational institutions is also profound. Realizing the potential of these telescopes requires automating and connecting them into a network. The Robotic Observatory by HARDWARE.astronomy and Telescope Network, or ROBH.aT Network (pronounced "robot") aims to do just this by leveraging open-source hardware devices to develop the hardware necessary to robotize a telescope at low-cost and with primarily undergraduate students.

abstract={As a result of the globalisation of the semiconductor design and fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={This study proposes an action identification system for home upper extremity rehabilitation. In the proposed system, we apply an RGB-depth (color-depth) sensor to capture the image sequences of the patient's upper extremity actions to identify its movements. We apply a skin color detection technique to assist with extremity identification and to build up the upper extremity skeleton points. We use the dynamic time warping algorithm to determine the rehabilitation actions. The system presented herein builds up upper extremity skeleton points rapidly. Through the upper extremity of the human skeleton and human skin color information, the upper extremity skeleton points are effectively established by the proposed system, and the rehabilitation actions of patients are identified by a dynamic time warping algorithm. Thus, the proposed system can achieve a high recognition rate of 98% for the defined rehabilitation actions for the various muscles. Moreover, the computational speed of the proposed system can reach 125 frames per second-the processing time per frame is less than 8 ms on a personal computer platform. This computational efficiency allows efficient extensibility for future developments to deal with complex ambient environments and for implementation in embedded and pervasive systems. The major contributions of the study are: (1) the proposed system is not only a physical exercise game, but also a movement training program for specific muscle groups; (2) The hardware of upper extremity rehabilitation system included a personal computer with personal computer and a depth camera. These are economic equipment, so that patients who need this system can set up one set at home; (3) patients can perform rehabilitation actions in sitting position to prevent him/her from falling down during training; (4) the accuracy rate of identifying rehabilitation action is as high as 98%, which is sufficient for distinguishing between correct and wrong action when performing specific action trainings; (5) The proposed upper extremity rehabilitation system is real-time, efficient to vision-based action identification, and low-cost hardware and software, which is affordable for most families. © 2018 by the authors.},

In case critical values appear, an alarm activates by control center, notifying by either electronic mail or web interface. The attractiveness of the proposal consists in the automation of the feeding system, which provides food supply to shrimps at certain daily periods, controlling by web interface the different options the breeder has available, a process that can be even managed remotely. © 2017 IEEE.},

The system is tested by performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic signals in a concentrated dye solution.

abstract={During pesticide application, operators are exposed to chemical products. Dermal exposure has been reported as the principal means of exposure for growers. In the present work, potential dermal exposure (PDE) has been assessed when using new low-cost equipment (a knapsack with a vertical spray boom) and compared to a hand-held spray lance, which is the equipment most widely used by growers in greenhouses. Two sprayers were used, a hand-held spray lance with four twin flat-fan nozzles and a knapsack fitted out with a vertical spray boom containing 3 pairs of twin flat-fan nozzles. Three applications were carried out and compared, one with the spray lance walking backwards (the reference application), and two with the spray boom - the first stopping at the turns and the second with no stopping. The patch method (19 position on the body) and tartrazine (the tracer) were used to assess de PDE. Each application tested was replicated three times. The results show that the knapsack with the vertical boom should not be used walking continuously along the greenhouse rows because the total PDE (1637.12 mL 1000 L−1) is greater than in the rest of the configurations tested. If the operator stops at the turns for a few seconds, allowing the previously sprayed droplet cloud to dissipate, the level of exposure decreases significantly (324.63 mL 1000 L−1), providing similar results to the reference application with the spray lance walking backwards (292.25 mL 1000 L−1). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={“Smart” water systems are transforming the field of stormwater management by enabling real-time monitoring and control of previously static infrastructure. While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream—such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system’s control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The digital data acquisition in real instrumentation is one of the most crucial operations in any data processing method, since the accuracy of provided samples is a strong influence factor for the achievable performance. In real scenarios, analog to digital converters are characterized by non-idealities that might strongly influence the achievable performance of algorithms, especially when hard limits or thresholds have to be complied and low cost hardware is an economical application requirement. In particular, in Cognitive Radio field, most sensing algorithms are tested in simulation environment by taking into account channel and instrumentation non-idealities as functions of Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) only. In this paper, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) stage is considered as an isolated factor of influence, by evaluating the performance worsening obtained for different resolutions of the quantizer. By comparing the obtained SNRs after ADC stage and their related performance with results achievable for the same SNRs, calculated by neglecting the effect of ADC, the authors claim to prove how ADC distortion effects degrade performance beyond the computable SNR and therefore they need to be carefully considered in sensing scheme design. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the recent years, there is a growing need for remote monitoring of electrical systems to assist users in making informed decision in managing their electrical systems. On top of the energy consumption and power usage, it is very useful to provide users fault detections, anomaly warnings and classification of load for predictive maintenance. This paper describes a low-cost solution that consists of multiple distributed slave meters with a single master computer. The distributed slave meter acquires the current waveform from the investigated cable of interest with non-intrusive current transducer. The low-cost hardware and small computer conditioned the data and extract a 2-feature data that will be send to the master computer remotely over Wi-Fi network. The master computer identifies each slave meters by their IP addresses and will perform logging, high level processing for classification, fault detection and anomaly warning. This solution can be implemented as a distributed monitoring network over a number of circuits in a building or vicinity, with the option of expanding into an Internet of Things (IoT) implementation. It can also be used as an ad hoc standalone investigation of a suspicious branch circuit for faults or anomalies. This solution has been tested with lighting, thermal and motor loads in an electrical circuit. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The existing power generation sources are unable to meet the hyper escalating electricity demand. Common solution is to install new generation plants to fulfill the electricity demand which it is not cost-effective. A cheap and effective solution is to monitor all the appliances running inside a building and to use them efficiently. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is one of the economical techniques to identify the appliances on the basis of their unique load signatures. In this paper, a machine learning based technique is presented to identify the devices for monitoring purposes. A low-cost hardware setup, called Appliance Identification and Management System (AIMS) is developed to identify and control the appliances remotely. The appliance identification algorithm is developed in Python and deployed on Raspberry Pi, coupled with Arduino. The hardware setup furnishes consumers with the real-time status of all home appliances on their smartphone and web server. Controlling module is also integrated with the identification hardware to provide smart access to consumer for the remote control of home appliances. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Return Oriented Programming is one of the major challenges for software security nowadays. It can bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP) mechanism by chaining short instruction sequences from existing code together to induce arbitrary code execution. Existing defenses are usually trade-offs between practicality, security, and performance. In this paper, we propose PMUe, a low-cost hardware ROP detection approach that detects ROP attack based on three inherent properties of ROP. It is transparent to user applications and can be regarded as a small extension to existing Performance Monitoring Unit in commodity processors. Our evaluation demonstrates that PMUe can effectively detect ROP attack with negligible performance overhead. © 2018 IEEE.},

Furthermore, a shift number counting method is proposed to solve the key problem of logarithmic operation. This method can significantly simplify the hardware architecture and reduce the area cost.

abstract={Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have the potential to assist in real-life tasks involving grasping and transportation, but not before solving several difficult research challenges. In this work, we address the design, control, estimation, and planning problems for cooperative localization, grasping, and transportation of objects in challenging outdoor scenarios. We demonstrate an autonomous team of MAVs able to plan safe trajectories for manipulation of ferrous objects, while guaranteeing interrobot collision avoidance and automatically creating a map of the objects in the environment. Our solution is predominantly distributed, allowing the team to pick and transport ferrous disks to a final destination without collisions. This result is achieved using a new magnetic gripper with a novel feedback approach, enabling the detection of successful grasping. The gripper design and all the components to build a platform are clearly provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the proposed solution is validated through experimental results, where difficulties include inconsistent wind, uneven terrain, and sandy conditions. © 2016 IEEE.},

An image quality typical of dedicated and more expensive confocal microscopes is achieved via software magnification by exploiting information redundancy in the video sequence. In particular, the HR image is generated from the best LR frames, obtained by identifying the most suitable endothelium video subsequence using a support vector machine-based learning approach, followed by a robust graph-based frame registration. Results on long, real sequences show that the proposed approach is fast and produces better quality images than both classical multiframe super-resolution approaches and commercial state-of-the-art mosaicing software.

abstract={Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A telescope control system relies on a pointing model to determine the gimbal angles that aim the telescope toward a desired target. High-accuracy telescope pointing models include parameters that describe the mount/telescope orientation as well as common mechanical effects. For professional telescopes, calibrating the pointing model requires careful initial alignment around a nominal orientation (e.g., leveling) followed by sightings of dozens to hundreds of stars to fit the model parameters. While this approach is effective for observatories, applications such as transportable optical ground stations for communications, space situational awareness, or astronomy using low-cost telescope networks can benefit from a more rapid calibration approach. We formulate a quaternion-based pointing model that utilizes measurements from an externally mounted star camera to compromise between calibration speed and accuracy. A key aspect of this formulation is that it is completely agnostic to the orientation of the telescope/mount so that no manual prealignment is required. We derive angle and rate commands for telescope pointing and tracking based on the model. We present results from a 15-min calibration procedure on a very low-cost telescope that demonstrated pointing to an accuracy of 53 arc sec RMS in azimuth and 66 arc sec RMS between 20-deg and 70-deg altitude. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Envisioned communication densities in Internet of Things applications are increasing continuously. Because these wireless devices are often battery powered, we need specific energy efficient (low-power) solutions. Moreover, these smart objects use low-cost hardware with possibly weak links, leading to a lossy network. Once deployed, these low-power lossy networks (LLNs) are intended to collect the expected measurements, handle transient faults, topology changes, etc. Consequently, validation and verification during the protocol development are a matter of prime importance. A large range of theoretical or practical tools are available for performance evaluation. A theoretical analysis may demonstrate that the performance guarantees are respected, while simulations or experiments aim on estimating the behaviour of a set of protocols within real-world scenarios. In this paper, we review the various parameters that should be taken into account during such a performance evaluation. Our primary purpose is to provide a tutorial that specifies guidelines for conducting performance evaluation campaigns of network protocols in LLNs. We detail the general approach adopted in order to evaluate the performance of layer 2 and 3 protocols in LLNs. Furthermore, we also specify the methodology that should be adopted during the performance evaluation, while reviewing the numerous models and tools that are available to the research community. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: The use of multiple infusions through one cannula is an increasingly common practice in anaesthesia. High pressures in the line often lead to occlusion alarms and pump disconnection. In this study, we aim to determine the pressures generated in common 3-way infusion devices, using simple low-cost equipment available and currently in use in the operating theatre environment. Methods: We compared three different common and commercially available 3-way infusion devices that allowed multiple infusions through one cannula in vitro. One with anti-siphon valves, one without valves, and serial extension sets with side ports connected in series. An invasive blood pressure transducer was used to monitor line pressure. Seven different infusion rates were used to simulate different infusions. Results: 3-way infusion devices with anti-siphon valves have 5.5 times the infusion pressures compared to devices without valves (P < 0.001). The highest pressures obtained across all devices were at the highest flow rate studied (400 ml/hr); this was 243 mmHg in the 3-way device with anti-siphon valves, compared to only 44 mmHg in the 3-way device without valves and 36 mmHg in the serial extension sets. Serial extension sets have the lowest pressures across all flow rates when compared to 3-way devices without valves. (P = 0.0001). Conclusions: The presence of anti-siphon valves generate very high pressures in infusion lines that can contribute to occlusion alarm disconnection of a pump. However, when measured alone and in-vitro, these pressures are not sufficient to trigger occlusion alarms. There are 3-way infusion devices without anti-siphon valves that have lower line pressures, but clinicians should be aware of negative pressure scenarios which can lead to siphoning when using them. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Fog computing is gaining attention due to the potential of aggregating and processing time-sensitive data at the nearby intelligent gateways. It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM/GPRS technology and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog Gateways scheme in real-time application. © 2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Some countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have increased their presence in the production and export of orchids. Ecuador has 14% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports increased 8%, this shows the importance of this product for the country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design, prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in the field. Approximately 3000 samples were obtained with a 100% reliability rate in the transit of the data within the process of acquisition, transmission, reception and storage. © 2018 AISTI.},

abstract={MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) researchers have shown increased interest in using mobile robot technology for their testbed platforms. Thus, the main motivation of this paper is to review various robot-based MANET testbeds that have been developed in previously reported research. Additionally, suggestions to heighten mobility mechanisms by using mobile robots to be more practical, easy and inexpensive are also included in this paper, as we unveils ToMRobot, a low-cost MANET robot created from an ordinary remote control car that is capable of performing a real system MANET testbed with the addition of only a few low-cost electronic components. Despite greatly reduced costs, the ToMRobot does not sacrifice any of the necessary MANET basic structures and will still be easily customisable and upgradeable through the use of open hardware technology like Cubieboard2 and Arduino, as its robot controller. This paper will also include guidelines to enable technically limited MANET researchers to design and develop the ToMRobot. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two pronged objectives namely (i) to facilitate other MANET researchers by providing them with a source of reference that eases their decision making for selecting the best and most suitable MANET mobile robots for real mobility in their MANET testbeds (ii) to provide MANET researchers with a prospect of building their own MANET robots that can be applied in their own MANET testbed in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This work describes how a low cost equipment, a LEGO Mindstorms NXT kit, has been used to teach VAL II, which is a standard programming language for industrial robots. Previously, the students had programmed the embedded system that moves the LEGO robot arms. Thus, they may compare programming the controller (the NXT brick, in NXC) and programming the industrial robot to execute a specific trajectory (the VAL II program). For that reason, the authors designed a software architecture that includes a wrapper to encapsulate the most relevant commands of VAL II and a programming environment. The wrapper was implemented for the same two degrees of freedom SCARA robot that students had already used. The software architecture provides the following functionalities: (1) simulate the trajectories by means of a simple graphical engine; (2) execute VAL II programs in a 2DoF LEGO robot; and (3) create a low cost remote laboratory. © 2018 AISTI.},

abstract={The pumping system of the Administration Board of Drinking Water and Sanitation of the Algarrobera (JAAPS-LA) is made up of a cylindrical aquifer with dimensions of 70 meters deep and 0.305 meters in diameter, the central element of this system is the submersible pump electrical, which is controlled by time. This current system has some deficiencies, among them the shortage of drinking water when the demand of the users is higher than the nominal one; and the large waste of potable water when the demand is lower than the nominal one. The present work proposes the design, implementation and integration of a monitoring and automation system applied to the JAAPS-LA pumping system, based on a wireless sensor network, open hardware and a PLC. As a result, all the modules of the system were implemented: the liquid level acquisition module in the distribution tank by means of liquid level sensors; the wireless data transmission and reception module; the drive module of the pump by means of the Programmable logic controller (PLC); and, finally, the solar-photovoltaic energy capture module. To evaluate the performance of the monitoring and automation system implemented, the behavior was monitored for 4 days, with the data obtained it was possible to verify the correct pump drive logic and the high efficiency (100%) of the communication system. © 2018 AISTI.},

This paper discusses the inner workings of LASIMUP (LArge Scale Interactive MUlti-Projection), a platform that aims to bypass that limitation by developing the appropriate software and the use of low-cost supplementary hardware which can enable such functionality. The platform presented has the benefits of being cross-platform, easy to install and affordable to acquire. These factors enable the possibility of creating large scale applications, that otherwise would be impractical to deploy, with a very small financial and operating overhead. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Robotic automation is considered as the fourth industrial revolution by multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20%. However, for small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller, cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while moving around the RFID tagged floor. © 2018 IEEE.},

A typical example is the design of PI control laws for the speed control problem of DC motors. Embedded control is taught nowadays using cheap take-home equipment based on low-cost microprocessors like Arduino and dc micro-motors. Although offering ease for the demonstration of simple PI control laws, these motors exhibit nonlinear characteristics, which can be dealt with the application of more advanced control laws. The paper's purpose is twofold: first, to explore the possibilities offered by low-cost equipment, as a test bed for the 'proof of concept' of more sophisticated switching control laws; and secondly to unfold the possibilities offered by this new environment for teaching, demonstration, project work, as well as research purposes, in the current laboratory practice. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={We designed, produced and characterized new capacitive strain sensors based on colloidal gold nanoparticles. The active area of these sensors, made up of a 1 mm2 close-packed assembly of gold nanoparticles between interdigitated electrodes, was designed to achieve measurable capacitance (&gt;∼1 pF) and overcome parasitic capacitances. Electro-mechanical experiments revealed that the sensitivity of such capacitive sensors increases in relation to the size of the nanoparticles. In the case of 14 nm gold NPs, such sensors present a relative capacitance variation of -5.2% for a strain of 1.5%, which is more than 5 times higher than that observed for conventional capacitive strain gauges. The existence of two domains (pure capacitive domain and mixed capacitive-resistance domain) as a function of the frequency measurement allows for the adaptation of sensitivity of these capacitive sensors. A simple low-cost circuit based on a microcontroller board was finally developed to detect the capacitance variations of such NP based strain sensors. This low-cost equipment paves the way for the development of an entirely wireless application set-up. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={This paper describes the initial development of a low-cost Lagrangian drifter based on solar panels, ultracapacitor and open hardware-software platform. The drifter is powered by a solar panel and a single Ultracapacitor that stores the energy. The drifter has a sensor suite formed by a GPS, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity sensors and a camera. The energy management and signal processing from sensors is supported by an Arduino Mega development board. The communications between the ground station and a deployed drifter is based on Iridium Satellite Terminal. All mechanical and electronic components are self-contained in a pressure housing. The main purpose of this Lagrangian drifter is: detect a red tide near Ecuadorian coasts, obtain physical-chemical parameters in-situ then send the measurements trough a satellite network to a ground station. Results from sea trials are shown. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In 2013 the Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) was started. It aims at determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows, e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals on real hardware. © 2018 IEEE.},

The proposed architecture can help advertisers or organizations to save on hardware costs, manage their content, and to be able to format their impressions in real time, and the number of displays can be expanded indefinitely. The architecture also offers low-cost hardware and software development methods, including real-time management and control. After installing the system developed with the proposed architecture, the system is evaluated by gathering feedback from developers, system administrators, and users.

abstract={Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In recent years, there have been many advances in vehicle technologies based on the efficient use of real-time data provided by embedded sensors. Some of these technologies can help you avoid or reduce the severity of a crash such as the Roll Stability Control (RSC) systems for commercial vehicles. In RSC, several critical variables to consider such as sideslip or roll angle can only be directly measured using expensive equipment. These kind of devices would increase the price of commercial vehicles. Nevertheless, sideslip or roll angle or values can be estimated using MEMS sensors in combination with data fusion algorithms. The objectives stated for this research work consist of integrating roll angle estimators based on Linear and Unscented Kalman filters to evaluate the precision of the results obtained and determining the fulfillment of the hard real-time processing constraints to embed this kind of estimators in IoT architectures based on low-cost equipment able to be deployed in commercial vehicles. An experimental testbed composed of a van with two sets of low-cost kits was set up, the first one including a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, and the other having an Intel Edison System on Chip. This experimental environment was tested under different conditions for comparison. The results obtained from low-cost experimental kits, based on IoT architectures and including estimators based on Kalman filters, provide accurate roll angle estimation. Also, these results show that the processing time to get the data and execute the estimations based on Kalman Filters fulfill hard real time constraints.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use of low-cost hardware (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote equipment and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart logistics and warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities. Nevertheless, farmers are agriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT applications. Users who use IoT applications must participate in its design, improving the integration and use. In this work, different industrial agricultural facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain knowledge and experience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural applications. Internet of things paradigms are used as resources to facilitate the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules and smart processes are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies. The aim is to help farmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new facilities. Different decision trees to automate the installation, designed by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed in this document. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has been released by 3GPP to provide extended coverage and low energy consumption for low-cost machine-type devices. Requiring only a reasonably low-cost hardware update to the already deployed long term evolution base stations and being compatible with current core network and enhanced core solutions that aim to reduce the battery consumption and minimize the signaling, NB-IoT deployments are quickly increasing, making NB-IoT a dominating technology for low-power wide area networks. To this aim, in this paper, we focus on group communications (i.e., multicast) in NB-IoT to efficiently support the transmission of firmware, software, task updates, or commands toward a large set of devices. We discuss the architectural and procedural enhancements needed to support the unique features of group communications in machine-type environments, such as customer-driven group formation. We also extend the NB-IoT frame to include a channel for multicast transmissions. Finally, we propose two transmission strategies for multicast content delivery and evaluate their performance considering the impact on the downlink background traffic and the channel occupancy. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={As the expectation for higher quality of life increases, consumers have higher demands for quality food. Food authentication is the technical means of ensuring food is what it says it is. A popular approach to food authentication is based on spectroscopy, which has been widely used for identifying and quantifying the chemical components of an object. This approach is non-destructive and effective but expensive. This paper presents a computer vision-based sensor system for food authentication, i.e., differentiating organic from non-organic apples. This sensor system consists of low-cost hardware and pattern recognition software. We use a flashlight to illuminate apples and capture their images through a diffraction grating. These diffraction images are then converted into a data matrix for classification by pattern recognition algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and three partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-based methods. We carry out experiments on a reasonable collection of apple samples and employ a proper pre-processing, resulting in a highest classification accuracy of 94%. Our studies conclude that this sensor system has the potential to provide a viable solution to empower consumers in food authentication. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In recent years, there have been many advances in vehicle technologies based on the efficient use of real-time data provided by embedded sensors. Some of these technologies can help you avoid or reduce the severity of a crash such as the Roll Stability Control (RSC) systems for commercial vehicles. In RSC, several critical variables to consider such as sideslip or roll angle can only be directly measured using expensive equipment. These kind of devices would increase the price of commercial vehicles. Nevertheless, sideslip or roll angle or values can be estimated using MEMS sensors in combination with data fusion algorithms. The objectives stated for this research work consist of integrating roll angle estimators based on Linear and Unscented Kalman filters to evaluate the precision of the results obtained and determining the fulfillment of the hard real-time processing constraints to embed this kind of estimators in IoT architectures based on low-cost equipment able to be deployed in commercial vehicles. An experimental testbed composed of a van with two sets of low-cost kits was set up, the first one including a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, and the other having an Intel Edison System on Chip. This experimental environment was tested under different conditions for comparison. The results obtained from low-cost experimental kits, based on IoT architectures and including estimators based on Kalman filters, provide accurate roll angle estimation. Also, these results show that the processing time to get the data and execute the estimations based on Kalman Filters fulfill hard real time constraints. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab’s approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen/civic veillance, or “sousveillance”, by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential–drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manufacturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable. This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them. Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (Turtle-Bot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future. © 2018 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.},

The CNN-embedded algorithm quantifies and classifies dissimilarities between the frames representing healthy and damaged structural conditions. In a case study, the CNN-embedded application was experimentally evaluated using three piezoelectric patches glued onto an aluminium plate. The results reveal an impressively effective 100% hit rate.

It measures voltages, currents and temperatures, to avoid critical and lifetime shortening operating conditions. States like state of charge (SoC) and power capability are estimated, calculated and predicted therefor. The full capacity of each cell in the pack is used, by means of active or passive load balancing. The BMS functions are developed by using a low-cost RCP system, which consists of an open source simulation tool and a low cost hardware platform. The development of a nonlinear SoC estimator and an active balancing function will be used as an example for the model-based design process. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a cost-effective implementation method of a ball and plate system as an educational kit and present the application of sliding mode control to achieve better control performance. We choose a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance, and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system can be efficiently used as an educational tool. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Ground displacement monitoring is one of the most important aspects of early warning systems and risk management strategies when addressing phenomena such as landslides or subsidence. Several types of instrumentation already exist, but those able to provide real-time warnings on multiple time series are typically based on expensive technology, highlighting the need to develop a low-cost, easy to install system suitable for emergency monitoring. Therefore, a wireless network based on ultra-wideband impulse radiofrequency technology has been realized. The novelty of this network consists of its ability to measure the distance between nodes using the same signals used for transmission without the need for an actual measurement sensor. The system was tested by monitoring a mudflow in Central Italy and revealed its suitability as an early warning tool. More research on the integration of future low-cost hardware and eventual industrialization would provide further improvement to this promising technology. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Currently available interactive technologies and infrastructure such as open source hardware, increased processing power, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Natural Language processing (NLP) and connectivity through the internet, have led to a new definition of human living. Smart homes, smart streets, smart cities and eventually a smarter planet, is what humans are progressing towards. The boon in things being smart is that it involves automation and interactive technologies, something that we as humans prefer over introvert and monotonous characteristic of machines. However, most present systems have a physical entity like a remote or a personal device assistant (PDA) which is used to control our homes. When the access to these physical devices is lost, you can no longer control them. This paper addresses this very issue and proposes a solution which eliminates the need for any physical device. It proposes a multi-functional 'Smart Home Automation System' (SHAS) controlled using an interactive and humanoid central processing unit which is powered by features of AI and NLP. Voice-commands to control the devices of the house such as fans, lights, doors, etc. can be given by the residents. The system is also intelligent enough to search things which it doesn't quite understand using the internet. The system has a camera integrated for continuously monitoring the home and also uses image processing techniques to identify the people trying to access the house. The system also has an automated mailing system which e-mails photos captured by the camera based on valid/invalid users. The system is aimed at being easy, cost-effective and non-physical. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of >99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions. © 2018 Nandy et al.

abstract={This study aims to design a mechanism with which the density of any solid or liquid can be determined without measuring its mass and volume in order to help students comprehend the concept of density more easily. The solidensimeter comprises of two scaled and nested glass containers (graduated cylinder or beaker) and sufficient water. In this method, the density measurement was made using the Archimedes' principle stating that an object fully submerged in a liquid displaces the same amount of liquid as its volume, while an object partially submerged or floating displaces the same amount of liquid as its mass. Using this method, the density of any solids or liquids can be determined using a simple mathematical ratio. At the end of the process a mechanism that helps students to comprehend the density topic more easily was designed. The system is easy-to-design, uses low-cost equipment and enables one to determine the density of any solid or liquid without measuring its mass and volume. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This paper presents low-cost experiments for laboratory sessions of a feedback control systems course, which introduces them modeling feedback control systems, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller design, root locus and Bode plots. The experiments are organized around the Arduino-based identification and control of a DC motor via Matlab/Simulink. The objective of this laboratory session is to support teaching feedback control systems via experimental investigations on a low-cost laboratory kit. The built in-house setups support Arduino–Simulink interface, so that students can download their control diagrams in Simulink to the Arduino board directly. This interface allows students to utilize high level control design tools, such as Matlab/Simulink while working on a low-cost hardware laboratory setup. Students’ performance in the written exams before and after the laboratory setup were reported to evaluate the instructional effectiveness. Besides, student feedback for four semesters are also presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the laboratory experiments. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: “AudioMoth.” The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of ∼US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources. © 2017 The Authors.

It is specifically tailored to hardware implementations with finite precision arithmetic in distributed computing scenarios, where the massive use of low-cost hardware resources for sensor networks or computing agents is necessary in order to deal with big data, IoT paradigms and multiple sources of information. The proposed algorithm does not require any specific DSP operation to be implemented in hardware, like matrix inversions or multiplications, for real-time learning. However, experimental results prove that the algorithm outperforms commonly adopted recursive least-squares algorithms optimized for hardware implementation, while the loss of performance with respect to batch training is reduced, as the proposed approach is proved to be very efficient when a reduced number of bits is adopted for finite precision hardware implementation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents timing efficient and low cost hardware customization of a single core general purpose processor architecture for Montgomery Modular Multiplication (MMM) and exponentiation. MMM demands a lot of computation time and is the key for efficient cryptography applications. Our hybrid approach consists in elaborating an optimized C code (software) while customizing a Tensilica® Xtensa processor instruction set architecture in order to accelerate MMM. We substitute the Standard Multiplication (grade school multiplication) with a complexity order of O(n2) by a Karatsuba multiplication with a complexity of O(n1.585), so that all the critical hardware components are shared. Moreover, the proposed design was developed to deal with modulus length of 1024 up to 4096-bit. The architecture was described in Tensilica® Instruction Extension (TIE) language and synthesized in Cadence® Xtensa Xplorer. Experiments show that our design can perform the modular exponentiation algorithm with 167k gates in 414,708,349 cycles considering 4096-bit modulus length in a lightweight processor configuration without a cache memory. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Virtual reality (VR) is resurging in popularity with the advancement of low-cost hardware and more realistic graphics. How might this technology help others? That is, to increase mental well-being? The ultimate VR might look like lucid dreaming, the phenomenon of knowing one is dreaming while in the dream. Lucid dreaming can be used as an introspective tool and, ultimately, increase mental well-being. What these introspective experiences are like for lucid dreamers might be key in determining specific design guidelines for future creation of a technological tool used for helping people examine their own thoughts and emotions. This study describes nine active and proficient lucid dreamers' representations of their introspective experiences gained through phenomenological interviews. Four major themes emerged: sensations and feelings, actions and practices, influences on experience, and meaning making. This knowledge can help design a VR system that is grounded in genuine experience and preserving the human condition. © 2018 ACM.},

abstract={Robotics is one of the major disruptive technologies of our time, and offers significant opportunities for innovation and competitiveness in the global marketplace. However, in resource-poor countries like India, engineering education is hampered by a lack of access to affordable and innovative hands-on practical education modules for the laboratory. This is especially the case in emerging disciplines like robotics. Moreover, expensive commercial grade robots offer limited scope for experimentation and learning outcomes in an academic setting. This situation can be remedied with the increasing affordability and versatility of open source hardware like microcontrollers and microcomputers, commercial off-The-shelf components like motors, actuators, sensors and power transmission mechanisms, as well as free, open source software. In this paper, a low-cost build your own (BYO) three-link electrically actuated robot manipulator is designed and developed for adoption in robotics and mechatronics laboratory courses. It can be disseminated and adapted on a wide scale at affordable cost for hands-on manufacturing education. © 2017 IEEE.},

It has major detrimental impact on scarce, underground water resources, takes over the local flora ecosystems and affects the soil environment. Manual removal of saplings is time-consuming and expensive. Presently, the removal of the weed is performed manually which is time-consuming, or using very expensive commercial heavy equipment.

abstract={Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are increasingly becoming integral parts of many non-electrical fields of engineering, e.g., Precision Agriculture, Avionics, Bionics, Civionics, and so on. Modern mechanical engineering is nearly synonymous with Mechatronics, and more recently Mechaphonics, viz., study of mechanical systems controlled by mobile phone apps, has become popular. Pneumatics, or compressed air, and hydraulics are niche areas of mechanical engineering with many industrial and other applications, and their performance is enhanced by incorporating electronic hardware and computer software. Many of these systems are also good examples of so-called smart products and Internet of Things. In this paper, an affordable build-your-own (BYO) computer control system is designed and developed for hands-on instruction in electro-pneumatics education.

Here, we present a systematic guide to a low-cost (<$10 per student) outreach workshop on wearable electronics for middle school students (and potentially high school students with minor modifications) that is complementary to existing STEM outreach programs. In this workshop, students use basic craft skills to fabricate a wearable human-computer interface out of commercially available materials. The device is interfaced with a computer via open-source hardware and software, using the universal serial bus (USB) human interface device (HID) protocol. The workshop exposes students to wearable technologies, a rapidly growing and exciting sub-domain of the electronics industry, and provides a fun and engaging hands-on activity that draws connections between fashion, technology, and personal electronics. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Applications involving data acquisition from sensors need samples at a preset frequency rate, the filtering out of noise and/or analysis of certain frequency components. We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and intuitive. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Syringe pump extruders are required for a wide range of 3D printing applications, including bioprinting, embedded printing, and food printing. However, the mass of the syringe becomes a major challenge for most printing platforms, requiring compromises in speed, resolution and/or volume. To address these issues, we have designed a syringe pump large volume extruder (LVE) that is compatible with low-cost, open source 3D printers, and herein demonstrate its performance on a PrintrBot Simple Metal. Key aspects of the LVE include: (1) it is open source and compatible with open source hardware and software, making it inexpensive and widely accessible to the 3D printing community, (2) it utilizes a standard 60 mL syringe as its ink reservoir, effectively increasing print volume of the average bioprinter, (3) it is capable of retraction and high speed movements, and (4) it can print fluids using nozzle diameters as small as 100 μm, enabling the printing of complex shapes/objects when used in conjunction with the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) 3D printing method. Printing performance of the LVE is demonstrated by utilizing alginate as a model biomaterial ink to fabricate parametric CAD models and standard calibration objects. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Paper-based devices are continuing to grow rapidly. However, conventional paper patterning methods are mostly restricted to the fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) patterns. Here, we present a novel patterning method for the fabrication of 2D and 3D paper-based devices. For the first time, a 3D fluidic channel network with multiple crossings of fluidic channels is successfully fabricated on a layer of paper without sophisticated procedures. The proposed method utilizes a commercially available inkjet printer to print water pattern as a protective mask onto both sides of a paper substrate and followed by soaking the sample into a non-polar solution which contains a hydrophobic substance to form hydrophobic barriers on the paper substrate. The printed water mask helps preventing the adsorption of the non-polar solution into the printed water area resulting in the formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas. This opens up a new route towards the development of 2D and 3D paper-based devices using low-cost equipment and a variety of materials. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Since the advent of modern computer-aided design software, engineers have been divorced from the highly collaborative environment previously enjoyed. Today's highly complex designs require modern software tools and the realities of a global economy often constrain engineers to remote collaboration. These conditions make it highly impractical to collaborate locally around physical models. Various approaches to creating new collaboration tools and software, which alleviate these issues, have been tried previously. However, past solutions either used expensive hardware, which is not widely available, or used standard two-dimensional (2D) monitors to share three-dimensional (3D) information. Recently, new low-cost virtual reality (VR) hardware has been introduced, which creates a highly immersive 3D experience at a tiny fraction of the cost of previous hardware. This work demonstrates an immersive collaborative environment built using a network of this hardware, which allows users to interact with gestures virtually and conducts a study to show its advantages over traditional video conferencing software.

abstract={The aim of this study is to design and implement a digital interactive globe system (DIGS), by integrating low-cost equipment to make DIGS cost-effective. DIGS includes a data processing unit, a wireless control unit, an image-capturing unit, a laser emission unit, and a three-dimensional hemispheric body-imaging screen. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the learning effectiveness of our system. A total of 105 junior high-school students from Taiwan participated in this 8-week experiment. The students were divided into three individual groups of 35 students each, with one control group and two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2). The results of one-way mixed design ANOVA indicated that participants in the experimental group, who used the DIGS, outperformed the other two groups, in the post-test as well as in the delayed test. These findings demonstrate that the proposed DIGS can effectively enhance the performance of the learners in an Earth Science course. © 2018, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

abstract={This paper proposes a bio-inspired visual motion estimation algorithm based on motion energy, along with its compact very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture using low-cost embedded systems. The algorithm mimics motion perception functions of retina, V1, and MT neurons in a primate visual system. It involves operations of ternary edge extraction, spatiotemporal filtering, motion energy extraction, and velocity integration. Moreover, we propose the concept of confidence map to indicate the reliability of estimation results on each probing location. Our algorithm involves only additions and multiplications during runtime, which is suitable for low-cost hardware implementation. The proposed VLSI architecture employs multiple (frame, pixel, and operation) levels of pipeline and massively parallel processing arrays to boost the system performance. The array unit circuits are optimized to minimize hardware resource consumption. We have prototyped the proposed architecture on a low-cost field-programmable gate array platform (Zynq 7020) running at 53-MHz clock frequency. It achieved 30-frame/s real-time performance for velocity estimation on 160 × 120 probing locations. A comprehensive evaluation experiment showed that the estimated velocity by our prototype has relatively small errors (average endpoint error < 0.5 pixel and angular error < 10°) for most motion cases. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Highly developed drone technology enables the use of drones in a wide variety of areas. However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big research topic and find a market in the near future. We developed an underwater drone with a 360° panoramic camera acting as the 'eye' of the drone. The designs are based on the open-source hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360° panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment. Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic in the artificial intelligence research field today. Experimental results show that the function of the underwater drone achieved at diving in the leak automatically. The 360° panoramic images were generated correctly. Fish recognition achieved 87% accuracy by deep learning. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of the underwater applications such as underwater acoustic communication require usage of high cost hardware devices. This constraint limits the research activities within this field. In due to cost limitation, there is a need to develop a low cost underwater communication device but still able to provide good performance to achieve the objectives. In this paper, underwater acoustic distance measurement system based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) overlap using low cost hardware platform is presented. Time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation is derived based on the intensity of the received signal with frequency of interest after computing forward FFT. The extraction of the signal from the receiver is performed by using digital signal processing algorithms. Strength of the received signal and its distance from the receiver are measured during the experiments. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate its capabilities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved numerous breakthroughs in many artificial intelligent applications. However, its complexity is quite high and usually requires expensive GPU or FPGA implementation, which is not cost-effective for many embedded systems. In this paper, we develop a novel lapped CNN (LCNN) architecture that is suitable for resource-limited embedded systems. Our architecture follows the divide-and-conquer principle. The CNN is designed such that it can be decomposed into two or more stages, each can be implemented by a hardware module with a low-resolution input and very low complexity. The original input image is divided into some subimages of the same size, with properly designed overlaps with each other. These subimages are sequentially processed by the hardware module that implements the first stage of the CNN. The outputs from different subimages are then merged and processed by the next stage low-cost hardware CNN module. The result is exactly identical to that of applying a larger-scale CNN to the entire image with higher resolution. Therefore, by reusing low-cost hardware CNN modules, a low-cost and larger-scale CNN system can be achieved. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by experimental results. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO 2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17–49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in many areas, such as intelligent transportation, smart city, hospital, games, education. Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the students’ answer to teachers’ managerment system, where there exists high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students’ identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms, such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students’ behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen the motivation of students’ learning. This IoT system can improve the attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students’ learning process for higher education. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Inspired by Human Genome Project, material genome initiative was launched in 2011 by the White House for the U.S., and similar research projects have also been funded in the other countries worldwide. While extending the genome idea from human to materials, the genome of granular materials is considered to be consisting of mineral compositions, crystal structure, and inherent defects. We envision the development of a database for the genome of sands by collecting the results of laboratory experiments at multiple scales. With the advancement of computational techniques and low-cost hardware, multiscale multiphysics models can be established according to the genome of granular materials from experimental-based database. This paper proposes a framework for determining genome of granular materials through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Some preliminary results have provided for determining the genome of granular materials, with anticipated benefits as follows: (i) promote the design of new granular materials and/or civil engineering materials with targeted properties, (ii) shorten the process from discovery to application of new civil engineering materials, and (iii) provide comprehensive insights into the influence of material genomes on mechanical performances from first-principle. © 2017 Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering},

abstract={Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literature without specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are increasingly being deployed for surveillance and monitoring applications. WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={With technology scaling leading to reliability problems and a proliferation of hardware accelerators, there is a need for cost-effective techniques to detect errors in complex datapaths. Modulo (residue) arithmetic is useful for creating a shadow datapath to check the computation of an arithmetic datapath and involves three key steps: reduction of the inputs to modulo shadow inputs, computation with those shadow values, and checking the outputs for consistency with the shadow outputs. The focus of this paper is new gate-level architectures and algorithms to reduce the cost of modulo shadow datapaths. We introduce low-cost architectures for all four key functional units in a shadow datapath: (1) a modulo reduction algorithm that generates architectures consisting entirely of full-adder standard cells; (2) minimum-area modulo adder and subtractor architectures; (3) an array-based modulo multiplier design; and (4) a modulo equality comparator that handles the residue encoding produced by the above. We compare our functional units to the previous state-of-the-art approach, observing a 12.5% reduction in area and a 47.1% reduction in delay for a 32-bit mod-3 reducer; that our reducer costs, which tend to dominate shadow datapath costs, do not increase with larger modulo bases; and that for modulo-15 and above, all of our modulo functional units have better area and delay then their previous counterparts. We also demonstrate the practicality of our approach by designing a custom shadow datapath for error detection of a multiply accumulate functional unit, which has an area overhead of only 12% for a 32-bit main datapath and 2-bit modulo-3 shadow datapath. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In many resource/power constrained applications (e.g., in wireless-network nodes) there is a need for low cost hardware implementations of digital image watermarking techniques. However, to end up with such an implementation, a proper selection of a watermarking technique, based on performance and cost criteria, is not enough. For that reason, in this paper we introduce computation optimizations of the implemented algorithm to keep the integer portion of arithmetic operations at optimal size, and, hence, arithmetic units as small as possible. Additionally, the proposed architecture reutilizes those units in different computation steps, to further reduce implementation cost. The proposed design compares favorably with the already existing implementations, in terms of area, power and performance. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last few years, a demand for renewed product personalisation to satisfy the exact need of the customers has been observed in some markets. As opposed to customisation, which put emphasis on the satisfaction of explicit needs of a defined market segment, individualisation aims at satisfying the specific needs of a customer. Product design for Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform and multiple modules that are integrated with the platform, as per end-users' choice. This paper identifies key areas and components which need to be focused to realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an explorative study of existing product design and customisation approaches. A questionnaire survey has been conducted and results are presented for the industrial implication and insights on this approach. The findings clearly show that MI provides most individualised and technologically advanced product. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Attitude control is an important part in satellite on-orbit operation. It greatly affects the performance of satellites. Testing of an attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) is very challenging since it might require attitude dynamics and space environment in the orbit. This paper develops a low-cost hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulator for testing an ADCS of a CubeSat satellite. The simulator consists of a numerical simulation part, a hardware part, and a HIL interface hardware unit. The numerical simulation part includes orbital dynamics, attitude dynamics and Earth's magnetic field. The hardware part is the real ADCS board of the satellite. The simulation part outputs satellite's angular velocity and geomagnetic field information to the HIL interface hardware. Then, based on this information, the HIL interface hardware generates I2C signals mimicking the signals of the on-board rate-gyros and magnetometers and consequently outputs the signals to the ADCS board. The ADCS board reads the rate-gyro and magnetometer signals, calculates control signals, and drives the attitude actuators which are three magnetic torquers (MTQs). The responses of the MTQs sensed by a separated magnetometer are feedback to the numerical simulation part completing the HIL simulation loop. Experimental studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the simulator. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We organized a workshop with a theme of human augmentation, where EMS was not compelled to use. As a result, several groups found interest in using EMS for their development, and participants successfully used our toolkit for their presentation.

abstract={Software messaging frameworks help avoid errors and reduce engineering efforts in building distributed systems by (1) providing an interface definition language (IDL) to specify precisely the structure of the message (i.e., the message schema), and (2) automatically generating the serialization and deserialization functions that transform user data structures into binary data for sending across the network and vice versa. Similarly, a hardware-accelerated system, which consists of host software and multiple FPGAs, could also benefit from a messaging framework to handle messages both between software and FPGA and also between different FPGAs. The key challenge for a hardware messaging framework is that it must be able to support large messages with complex schema while meeting critical constraints such as clock frequency, area, and throughput. In this paper, we present HGum, a messaging framework for hardware accelerators that meets all the above requirements. HGum is able to generate high-performance and low-cost hardware logic by employing a novel design that algorithmically parses the message schema to perform serialization and deserialization. Our evaluation of HGum shows that it not only significantly reduces engineering efforts but also generates hardware with comparable quality to manual implementation. © 2017 IEEE.},

Innovation driven by open communities has proven to have a significant potential, in particular for open source software. However, tools and methodologies enabling the supervision of collaborative innovation involving open communities, in the perspective of creating open hardware to solve societal issues, remains at the early stages. This paper seeks to pinpoint the potentialities and challenges of such projects toward defining methods to better support a multi-stakeholders open source collaboration context. The experimental field of this research concerns the smart electricity distribution, and more precisely a public driven project of the diffusion of smart-meters in France and their appropriation by open source communities, with the involvement of the university and a public industrial company. The project seeks to study how these communities of users develop in a collaborative manner, new products and services using the smart-meter as a support technology. The first results show that the open community makes natural connection on specific environments such as Smart buildings to materialize usages of smart meters. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware codesign leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem. © Copyright 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

abstract={The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) (Shvachko et al., 2010) is a highly scalable and fault-tolerant distributed file system that can be deployed on low-cost hardware. The content stored in the HDFS is partitioned into blocks, and the blocks are replicated on multiple Data Nodes. Different block placement strategies can be used to make it highly fault-tolerant and to improve throughput and access time. The HDFS allows the user to (i) specify the block size to be used for partitioning a given file, (ii) issue only sequential read and append operations. It does not allow the user to perform random read and random write operations. This paper proposes an enhanced HDFS (REHDFS) that (i) explores different block placement and block read strategies, (ii) implements random read and random write operations. The proposed architecture is implemented and evaluated. The proposed load based block access strategy performed better than the other block retrieval strategies. The random read feature is implemented and evaluated. Pessimistic and optimistic models to implement the random write are proposed and evaluated. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents low-cost compressors for video display systems, which compress video data to reduce the size of the frame memory in a display panel in a television or a smartphone. The hardware solution exploits the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and 1-D set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) to support the raster-scan processing order in a display system and meet the fixed target compression ratio (CR). However, the compression efficiency and hardware cost often increase in proportion to the block size and thus, designing a compressor with low cost but high fidelity is challenging. This paper proposes a generic partitioned SPIHT algorithm, which achieves a low-cost design for mobile devices by allowing various sizes of partitioned sub-blocks. By taking advantage of DWT decomposition properties, the proposed algorithm partitions a coding block into sub-blocks, each of which can be processed independently. The independent coding operations among multiple sub-blocks allow the size of the hardware buffer to be decreased, by storing the temporary results only for an individual sub-block. However, the proposed sub-block coding slightly decreases the compression efficiency when each sub-block is compressed with the same target CR. To reduce the drop-off in the compression efficiency, the boundary-pixel handling in DWT is exploited and the proposed partitioned SPIHT method adjusts the target CR for each sub-block depending on the potential quality loss. When compared with the previous 1-D design, experimental results show that the hardware gate count and internal memory are reduced by 59.34% and 75%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed boundary handling and bit-allocation schemes mitigate the PSNR degradation due to the sub-block coding by 1.11 dB. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an adjacent feeders search based method for service restoration of distribution systems after single faults. The developed algorithm makes a search for sections that belong to adjacent feeders and comply with two conditions: have normally open equipment installed or have a three or more derivations. As soon as the sections are selected, an exhaustive search is executed to achieve the restoration plan. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, service restoration on a typical distribution system of Taiwan Power Company is applied. The results are compared with others approaches and show that the proposed method can provide a restoration plan very efficiently even under different load levels. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern homes are being crowded with electrical equipment, electronic entertainment devices and various home appliances. Consequently, power consumption and home electric bill has become a big burden on consumers. Accordingly, power rationalization through the use of smart devices can keep the consumer constantly aware and informed about the power consumption around the clock. Additionally, these devices can automate the power usage of home devices, thus converting modern homes to smart modern homes. Taking advantage of the evolving Internet of Things (IoT) and benefiting from the computational capabilities of the Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are proposing an open-source, low cost hardware and software solution that reduces power consumption, man power and maintains high level of security and scalability. The system was successfully tested at the Faculty of Information Technology labs at the University of Petra, Jordan. The system proved to work flawlessly and effectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to achieve unmanned aerial vehicle operation control 'human-machine-environment' coherence as a typical example of the application of loop control, the design and development of the modern unmanned aerial vehicle ground control station (GCS) is widely use human engineering. However, due to the extreme lack of human data in the actual environment, GCS human reliability analysis and evaluation work is seriously limited. Thus, with the CGS human engineering evaluation background, this paper relies on low-cost hardware equipment Leap Motion to carry out human data capture technology. First of all, the feasibility of GCS manpower data acquisition on Leap Motion was proofed by analyzing the space adaptability, capture speed accuracy adaptability and secondary development ability etc. Then those key technologies including action capturing, action modeling and information processing were studied and specific work processes and application opportunities were discussed. From the final results, gestures and motions of virtual hands were same as real ones. The building processing speed was far from minimum demand of 15 frames per second. The accuracy and real-time performance of analysis demonstrated the movements accurately capture and data processing ability on the whole, which satisfied real time and accuracy requirements for the manpower data capturing. © 2017 IEEE.},

The training stage consisted on a total of 147 training samples distributed in 49 training data for each type of study grip. In the experimental phase, 200 samples were acquired from a group of 10 participants and distributed in 10 samples in 2 sets of test for each type of grip. The results show that the difference in the recognition stage is not significant, so more advanced signal processing techniques will be put into effect in further studies to determine which technique is better. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper deals with e-learning design and development training courses, more precisely with remote training by practical activities of laboratory experiments (E-Lab). Indeed, the majority of remote training platforms offer theoretical courses and a few practical activities, which are essential in training theoretical Science and Technology. In order to share the costly equipment, in this work, we propose an open hardware/software architecture allowing remote access to a laboratory equipment by designing in Matlab two graphical interfaces using Internet/Intranet network and TCP/IP communication protocol. A real-Time control and supervision is performed to carry out all the practical activity according to a pedagogical scenario elaborated by the trainer. The use of these interfaces is illustrated by educational sessions articulated on the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) regulation and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) of temperature control system. The challenge of elaborating a remote practical activity with pedagogical effectiveness is accomplished in the above proposed solution. All the hardware and software that made available the remote experimentation platform give possibility to achieve others traditional activities in experimentation laboratory. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Current Learning Management Systems (LMS) are able to use the data automatically captured from the actions of their users to provide immediate feedback to students and to provide a rich dataset to be mined or analyzed to understand and optimize the learning process. However, in traditional education, not all, or even the majority, of learning products are created or processed through the LMS. Traditional education still uses paper-based assignments and assessments as an integral part of the process. In these cases, the data contained in the LMS is often incomplete and do not provide a holistic view of the students' activities. To alleviate this problem, this work describes SARA, a system to automatically capture paper-based assignments and evaluations while the instructor is writing feedback and grading them. This information is uploaded automatically to the LMS to become part of both, the feedback provided to students and the data available for analyzing the learning process. This system is based on low-cost hardware and requires little configuration and intervention from the final user to work. An initial evaluation of the system provides evidence of the feasibility and usefulness of SARA in real-world learning environments. © 2017 IEEE.},

This article studies the implementation of the Bosch BME280 integrated environmental unit which includes referential meteorological monitoring sensors for the estimation of temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure; used in mobile applications within the internet of things (IoT). The measurements produced by the Bosch unit are compared with those delivered by an automatic meteorological station (AWS) to determine the accuracy and reliability of the generated data. The outcomes show that the records present a constant phase shift, which, when determined and corrected, results in a similarity between measurements greater than 95%. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Arduino and Raspberry Pi are the most popular open source hardware in the world which are invented with the hope of inspiring generation of students to learn programming and be creative. The former is a simple AVR microprocessor but powered by simple programming IDE and the complete open hardware ecosystem. The latter is a powerful ARM based mini PC but it is not very easy to get started if users has no enough programming background. To combine the advantages of both an ARM based mini PC and the complete Arduino ecosystem. LinkSprite released a powerful mini PC platform: pcDuino, which represents PC + Arduino. This paper provides a review of pcDuino technology and especially introduces the several programming methods on pcDuino. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={This article illustrates how to evaluate platform design for an open source hardware development project. First, we will look at the open source hardware development as a methodology that fulfills demands for mass customization. In the open source hardware development, project owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources. Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs. Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers' participation is one of the key factors in successful project management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation. © 2018 International Journal of Industrial Engineering.},

Like in open source software, projects and online platforms have been evolving around physical products from various technologies where people jointly develop and freely share designs. We also find businesses that sell products made from these designs and offer complimentary services. This decentralized and collaborative model of value creation offers new opportunities for social, economic and ecological sustainability, but also calls for a different understanding beyond traditional notions. Results from an exploratory study on OSH projects and companies revealed that licensing is a critical issue, communities and partners play a key role in the open source ecosystem and modes of value creation are either centered around design or production in combination with a mix of complimentary services. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Open Source Hardware (OSH) products are those whose design are made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell them. In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing clarity in this emerging and moving field. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A program library for use on open-source hardware was developed in order to construct a low-cost environmental control system for greenhouses. The library facilitated the development of environmental sensing and control devices that conform to the protocols of the Ubiquitous Environment Control System (UECS). The open-source hardware used was the “Arduino Ethernet” and the “Arduino Mega 2560 with Ethernet Shield” microcontroller boards. UECS is a system for controlling greenhouse environments that communicates information via a local area network, and devices utilizing the library that we developed can perform the UECS defined communication tasks automatically. With the help of this library, device developers no longer need to program the communications aspects of the device and can concentrate on programming setting and control logic of the device. The library occupies about 29 kilobytes of the read only memory area of the target board. The library and associated open-source microcontroller boards are powerful tools for developing low-cost environmental control systems. © 2018 Biotron Institute. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The need for fabricating a prototype circuit arises frequently in electronics, including education and research laboratories. In resource-poor countries in the developing world, this is hindered by the high cost of commercial Printed Circuit Board (PCB) prototyping machines and long turn-around commercial fabrication process. Practical, hands-on laboratory teaching and experimentation is necessary to improve learning in electronics. In this paper, a low-cost build-your-own (BYO) semi-automated three-axis PCB milling machine for double-sided PCB prototyping is developed using commercial components and open source hardware and free open source software, to provide students, teachers, and engineers an accessible and affordable resource for PCB prototyping. Also, the main problems encountered during fabrication of PCB have been mentioned and the techniques used to solve them are discussed in detail. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Open-source hardware (OSHW), as low-cost and easy-to-use instrumentations, are particularly suited to the needs of the conservation field. This paper presents two OSHWs developed for the diagnosis of heritage metal artefacts. The DiscoveryMat application allows the qualitative analysis of slightly oxidised metals such as copper and aluminium-based alloys, through the standardized monitoring of the variation of their corrosion potential (Ecorr) with time. The Pleco allows the local identification of corrosion products through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots and this contributes to a better adjustment of conservation treatments on metal artefacts covered with heterogeneous corrosion layers through the selective intervention on some corrosion products and the preservation of others. If the Pleco can already be found in the toolbox of some conservation professionals, the DiscoveryMat application is still in its infancy and needs to be developed in the future as a participatory tool. © 2018, Research Trend.

abstract={Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.

abstract={The Army continues the development of 3D printing technology to enhance the capability to produce smaller and lighter precision weaponry. Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) are developing nano-based structures and components for advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing (Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the 3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for RF components and identified key material performance limits. Results show how more enhancement could be achieved by optimizing the variables that affect 3D printing. © 2018 SPIE.},

abstract={A humanoid head robot system with some specific expression was comprehensively modelled in this paper by interactive visual expression analysis between the operator and the robot. Firstly, based on the open source hardware of Fritz humanoid head robot, an integrated emotional expression mapping model was proposed by extending the functional module of voice, vision and so on. Secondly, to achieve a natural interaction between the expression robot and the operator, the integrated visual analysis is mainly utilised for emotion calculation. Haar-like featured cascade classified algorithm is utilised for automatic face location. Gabor feature is filtered and down-sampled as the emotional expression feature. To deal with unreasonable samples distribution in traditional eigenface, an optimised eigenvectors’s selection is built by comparing projection reconstructed images with original image. Finally, the classification of with-in class PCA with energy dimension is served as expression recognition. The experimental results on JAFFE database and real-time video image demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modelling scheme. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Water removal is an essential step during crude oil production due to several problems such as increased transportation costs and high corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm−2), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm−2). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsification in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we propose a novel path-planning algorithm for UAVs, which relies on continuously updating virtual regional field and its local gradients. The information of target regions and obstacles is incorporated in a virtual regional field. The algorithm circumvents the large number of variables to be optimized, and does not rely on any black boxes with unpredictable outputs. Real data show that the proposed algorithm can design a path with high coverage rate of the target region in a certain time duration, and guides the UAV to bypass the obstacles. The approach based on the regional field provides an option for low-cost hardwares, and reveals insights into the problem of path planning. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Implementing high-performance, low-cost hardware accelerators for the computationally intensive image and video processing algorithms has attracted a lot of attention in the last 20 years. Most of the recent research efforts were trying to figure out new design automation methods to fill the gap between the ability of realizing efficient accelerators in hardware and the tight performance requirements of the complex image processing algorithms. High-Level synthesis (HLS) is a new method to automate the design process by transforming high-level algorithmic description into digital hardware while satisfying the design constraints. This chapter focuses on evaluating the suitability of using HLS as a new tool to accelerate the most demanding image and video processing algorithms in hardware. It discusses the gained benefits and current limitations, the recent academic and commercial tools, the compiler’s optimization techniques and four case studies. © 2018 by IGI Global.

abstract={Monitoring radioelectric spectrum is a fundamental task that must be carried out for the proper use of wireless technologies in a country. It is particularly important for governments to regulate and control efficiently the use of this resource, as it is a strategic resource. The governments carry out the management of the radioelectric spectrum, but the demand for it, the increase of new wireless technologies and the misuse that certain clandestine companies make with the spectrum, require monitoring systems that are more efficient and sustained than the conventional equipment many times can not satisfy. Therefore, there are currently alternatives based on the concept of open source hardware and software that can be used to support spectrum monitoring activities using new concepts and architectures. This article presents an alternative for these measurements, which is known as software defined radio. This is a technique to build devices in which part of the hardware can be replaced by software routines, which reduces costs. The case of electromagnetic spectrum monitoring in the FM radio band in the city of Guayaquil in Ecuador is presented, using the parameters defined by the ARCOTEL local regulatory entity. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

abstract={The main aim of this paper depicts in design and implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter for a nonlinear system in an application of a sensor fusion from a practical point of view. The sensor fusion is a typical data processing problem in mechanical systems where individual measurements of (angular) positions, velocities or accelerations are done independently on each other but the measured values are correlated to each other via dynamics of the system. Moreover, the measurement is corrupted by noise. The sensor fusion technique is capable to gain proper information about positions, velocities or accelerations from inaccurate measurement. In background of the sensor fusion algorithm, in our particular case, works the Extended Kalman Filter. Its adaptation for a simple mechanical system represented by a nonlinear system are object of the research in this paper related to usage of the Extended Kalman Filter on a low cost hardware. © 2018},

This paper outlines the design of the system and presents experimental performance results. Three different styles of plastic gears, together with three different styles of defective gears, were used to test the system. A pattern matching tool was used for part classification. Nine experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effects of changing various hardware and software parameters, including: conveyor speed, gear feed rate, classification, and identification score thresholds. It was found that the system could achieve a maximum system accuracy of 95% at a feed rate of 60 parts/min, for a given set of parameter settings.

abstract={Aeroengine simulation technology plays an important role in the development of advanced aeroengines. It can assist the engine design, shorten the development cycle, and help to reduce the research expense. Aeroengine simulation platform is widely used, especially in the field of aerospace engineering education. Digital simulation is mainly used to validate the initial test of the control algorithm, but the effectiveness of the simulation results is somewhat limited and can not be used as a final reference. As opposed to digital simulation, the traditional aeroengine hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a high confidence method in the control algorithm test, but it is bulky, expensive and not easy to maintain, so it is an urgent need to develop an embedded, miniaturized, and economic HIL simulation platform for the purpose of engineering education. The embedded HIL simulation platform proposed in this paper is based on two kinds of open source hardware: Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The Raspberry Pi will operate as an engine model and the Arduino board will function as the controller. They exchange data through the built-in serial ports. Efficient C codes of the aeroengine model are generated using Real-Time Workshop (RTW) tool. Numerical simulation illustrates the potential of this economical solution in university engineering education. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract={In this paper, we propose an implementation method for a 2-DOF pendulum control system that is robust against actuator uncertainties. In order to guarantee the robustness against the uncertainty of the actuator, we derive a model in which the robot body’s acceleration is the system’s control input. We then verify its validity by implementing a 2-DOF pendulum system using an omni-directional robot(ODR). The 2-DOF pendulum system can be stabilized without a mathematical model of the actuator in the proposed method. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate uncertainty in the actuator parameters. Furthermore, the method provides the advantages of flexible selection of motors used as actuators. First, we design a mechanical part to measure the angular velocity of the motor and to measure the inclination of an inverted pendulum. Second, we derive a mathematical model of a 2-DOF pendulum system for acceleration which the control input. The controller adopts the Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) to obtain the acceleration required for stabilization. The determined acceleration is converted to the velocity references of wheels through integration and transformation. The velocity references are followed through PI-velocity controllers. Third, the control system is implemented using the open source hardware Nucleo-32 F303K8 board. We illustrate the proposed control system’s effectiveness through stabilization experiments.

abstract={The aging level of labor force in Korea is evaluated based on the percentage of workers above the age of 50 in the economically active population. While the percentage of elderly population was 25% in 2000 it is projected that it will reach 40% in 2020 and exceed 50% in 2050. The rapid increase of elderly population is leading to the decrease of productive population. It will also cause an aggravation of domestic productivity. Productivity decline due to the increase of elderly population can become visible within a few years. Information communication technology is finding ways to respond to this problem. Smart technology can enhance productivity through automation and intellectualization in a simple and repetitive labor field. Among smart technologies, the development of IoT technology has been carried out actively. Many examples that can increase productivity using IoT have been suggested widely. This study will describe the development of IoT using open source software and hardware that can minimize the development time of IoT technology. With examples of applying IoT technology to home automation for the development of a similar system in the future, this study seeks to suggest that productivity improvement using IoT communication to solve the problems of the decrease in productive population and productivity decline. In order to show that the issue of productivity decline due to aging can be solved using open source technology, this study suggested a direction by developing home automation using open source hardware and software. © 2018, Medwell Journals.},

As such, information sent from the decoy system to a monitoring system is unlikely to be noticed by an attacker. We describe a physical system that we have developed for testing and experimentation with this approach. The results so far are promising both in terms of the effectiveness of monitoring, and also with respect to the hidden communication. Moreover, while the decoy system is high-interaction, it does not lead to any system interruption on the main system. Our system is novel in that it is developed from scratch, using low-cost hardware in a manner that accurately captures the way communication would happen in a real system. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our framework, and discuss possible approaches to establishing formal proofs of security for this kind of physical system.

abstract={To enable highly automated driving and the associated comfort services for the driver, vehicles require a reliable and constant cellular data connection. However, due to their mobility vehicles experience significant fluctuations in their connection quality in terms of bandwidth and availability. To maintain constantly high quality of service, these fluctuations need to be anticipated and predicted before they occur. To this end, different techniques such as connectivity maps and online throughput estimations exist. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of a large-scale future deployment of such techniques by relying solely on low-cost hardware for network measurements. Therefore, we conducted a measurement campaign over three weeks in which more than 74,000 throughput estimates with correlated network quality parameters were obtained. Based on this data set—which we make publicly available to the community—we provide insights in the challenging task of network quality prediction for vehicular scenarios. More specifically, we analyse the potential of machine learning approaches for bandwidth prediction and assess their underlying assumptions.

The use of constructed wetlands like an emerging, low-cost technologies to mitigate the problem of As in reject water from ROS that are installed for rural and urban areas have been evaluated.

abstract={When performing an experimental modal test, the user has to define (i.e. draw) a geometry of the structure which includes the 3D locations and orientations of the vibration sensors (accelerometers, strain gages, etc.). This step is often tedious and time-consuming, especially for complex geometries containing a large number of sensors. Incorrect placement of sensors can lead to important errors [1]. In this paper, we propose a camera based method to semi-automatically link the geometry of an object under test with an available geometry in a CAD file. The technique uses low-cost equipment (a compact camera). Our method will be demonstrated on three test objects: a car, a bicycle frame and a drone aircraft model. In the case of the drone, the curved shape of the wing makes it very difficult to measure the position and orientation of the sensors manually. We show that we are able to detect the sensors with an accuracy of about 5 mm in the studied cases. © Proceedings of ISMA 2018 - International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering and USD 2018 - International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics.

abstract={With the increase of expectation for higher quality of life, consumers have higher demands for quality food. Food authentication is the technical means of ensuring food quality. One approach to food authentication is Near Infrared Spectroscopy which, for instance, can be used to differentiate between organic and non-organic apples. It is effective but time-consuming and expensive. This paper presents a novel approach where low-cost hardware devices are used to collect apple images by using smartphone combined with pattern approach. We using a smartphone to obtain the apple image, the color always changes over time during the processing of the acquisition, and record the image during the color change. We convert the image into a feature vector in RGB space so that can be analyzed in some pattern recognition algorithm. In this paper we use Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) to analyze the data. Experiments were carried out on a reasonable collection of apple samples and cross validation was used, resulting in an accuracy of around 90% between organic and non-organic apples. Our studies conclude that this approach has the potential to lead to a viable solution to empower consumers in food authentication. Copyright © 2018 SPIE.},

abstract={Industrial robots have high repeatability, but lack in terms of accuracy. For this reason, dedicated calibration procedures are often necessary to fulfil functional requirements of the application. A new method is proposed, which addresses the problem of calibrating an industrial robot around a given point of the workspace. This method requires a low cost equipment, including a length gauge, one calibration sphere and a simple reconfigurable support for the gauge (tool). The tool allows two different positionings of the gauge with respect to robot tool axis, with the measuring direction either alighed or perpendicular to the axis. Several measures are performed while moving the robot along the surface of the calibration sphere, with the gauge in both configurations. At the end of the measuring procedure, a set of x-y-z corrections (in tool reference frame) are calculated, that allow to correct robot positioning along the surface of the sphere in a way that the tool axis is perfectly aligned to the centre of the sphere. Validation has been performed using a 6-axis Epson C4-A601s robot (665mm reach, 4kg payload). The standard deviation of the positioning error has been reduced of more one order of magnitude, close to robot repeatability (0.02mm). © 2018 CURRAN-CONFERENCE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The investigation of seismic ambient noise (microtremor) in spectral ratio form, known as HVSR, is extremely popular nowadays both to investigate large areas in a reduced amount of time, and to leverage a wider choice of low cost equipment. In general, measurements at multiple locations are collected to generate multiple HVSR curves which can individually be inverted to retrieve local subsurface elastic properties. Recently, however, there has been an increasing interest on spatially correlating informative content from different locations. In this perspective, and in the broader context of a hydro-geological survey conducted at the Serravalle Sesia sedimentary basin (Italy), we collected and investigated 19 microtremor measurements with the objective of mapping the bedrock depth. In general, this requires manually extracting the main resonant frequency from individual curves and then “building” the desired map through a combined use of several software applications often resulting in a very time consuming workflow, especially for large surveys. Therefore, we developed and tested a new computer program, “OpenHVSR - Processing Toolkit”, specifically engineered to process and display the informative content of data in 2D and 3D, to optimize the investigation of spatially varying properties. The obtained HVSR curves were then inverted using OpenHVSR, the counterpart code developed previously for inversion. © 2018 J and N Group, Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Free access to Earth Observations in various electromagnetic bands, the growing number of available spectral bands in imaging instruments, and the ever-better quality of corresponding products all contribute to the growing number of available applications, especially ones found in the civilian sector. On one hand, the progress made recently in the field of small satellites allows for a significant reduction in cost in both satellite design and launch, which creates numerous new opportunities for the use of small satellites in the Earth Observation field this is thus far dominated by much larger satellites. In this article, we will present an overview of the instruments that are currently used on cubesat, microsatellites and other small satellites. After conducting extensive studies, we present an analysis of the discussed instruments from the point of view of a potential microsatellite mission. This analysis is conducted based on the HyperSat microsatellite platform which is being developed by Creotech Instruments S.A. The HyperSat platform is developed in an open software and open hardware manner, which is also addressed further in this article. © 2016 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

abstract={This research explores the real-time process control of polymer flowability in Powder Bed Fusion (PBF). To do so, a novel system based on machine vision and an image-processing algorithm was developed and tested in an open hardware and software PBF system. The system has the ability to analyze the quality of the powder bed by computing a defect ratio of the powder bed after each recoating operation. Then, this ratio is used as a performance variable in three full factorial Design of Experiments (DOE). The results show that the installation of machine vision and image processing system can potentially provide a signal to repeat the recoating process and correct the defect on the powder bed. At the same time, recoating process parameters can be adjusted dynamically to guarantee an optimum quality of the powder bed and minimize possible build failures.

However, it is rare to see this kind of very low-cost data acquisition (DAQ) system in science education, where it might replace expensive commercial devices. These modular, constructed DAQs can be highly customisable to meet teacher needs. In a pilot project, such devices were introduced to university students learning to become elementary school science teachers. The potential for such devices to replace currently used commercial DAQs was examined, as well as the attitude of the students to this equipment. Focus was on the Arduino-based platform, which can operate in two different modes as a standalone data-logger device or as a DAQ connected to a computer with full data visualisation. All items of equipment developed were Arduino do it yourself (DIY) devices published on the GitHub portal, where they are freely available with support and examples. © 2018 WIETE.},

abstract={Low cost hardware and open source software tools specialized in biomedical applications have recently seen a significant growth both in popularity and diversity. Within the current landscape of such tools, BITalino is increasingly used by students and professors for educational activities and prototyping, due to its modular design and flexibility. However, there is currently no user-friendly way of storing data locally without setting up a wireless connection to a receiver unit (e.g. a computer or smartphone). This poses a problem, especially in uses cases where ambulatory data acquisition is needed. In this paper we present the LoggerBIT, a data logging block to enable data recording onto a microSD card in biomedical development toolkits, without requiring a connection to a receiver nor any particular programming or electronics skills to setup. Our work builds upon the OpenLog serial data logger, to which multiple optimisations were made in terms of hardware and firmware, overcoming limitations preventing its use in high data throughput applications. Our LoggerBIT approach is suitable for high-speed data recording, with results showing that it can log data of up to 4 analog channels at 1000 Hz for 24 hour periods without loss of packets, and from all analog channels with minimal data loss. This work contributes to the state-of-the-art with a comprehensive description and validation of the block, and with a set of supporting tools released in open source, thus available for the biomedical engineering community at large.

abstract={Biometric authentication is a trending topic in securing modern devices. Examples of this can be found in many widely deployed systems such as Apple’s Touch ID or Microsoft’s Windows Hello face recognition. Miniaturization and increased processing power are thereby leading to new applications not imaginable a couple of years ago. Such a solution is the new fingerprint smart card built by a Norwegian company that must not be named. Their biometric match-on-card platform is designed to provide a convenient solution for access, identity, and payment applications and aims to replace PIN authentication for the next generation of payment cards by VISA and Mastercard. In this paper, we are going to analyze how this company has implemented their already available demo kit for access control in hardware and software. We will point out critical weaknesses in its architecture and algorithm and show how these could be misused for payment, access and identity fraud by attackers able to steal or clone the device. Thereby, we combine software and hardware hacking techniques as well as extraction methods, to acquire fingerprints from photos and latent prints, to successfully spoof the system in various ways. This works in particular without the error-prone creation of physical dummies due to the exploitation of the insecure on-device communication. The attacks presented require little effort and low-cost equipment that can be already refinanced by abusing a single card at all. Finally, we will discuss countermeasures and ideas to improve the security of this and future implementations for match-on-card fingerprint authentication. © 2018 USENIX Association.

abstract={This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an "operational pragmatics." Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Opensource and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how "operational pragmatics" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism. © The Author(s) 2018.

abstract={This chapter presents a simple new wind energy concept based on airborne rotary power generation and tensile rotary power transfer to the ground. The inexpensive prototypes use flexible inflatable wings that are arranged on ring kites, similar to how the rotor blades of a wind turbine are arranged on the hub. These autorotating rotary ring kites are stacked and integrated into a tensile structure that transfers the collected rotational power to a ground-based generator. A separate lifting kite provides additional lift to elevate the stack of rotary ring kites. Simulations and prototype testing show that network kite rigging provides the stabilizing benefits of wide tethering to networked individual kites even during fast flight for power generation. Turbulence effects are largely smoothed on individual kites. Stacked rotary ring kites can be integrated into a lattice of interconnected lifting kites, to concurrently run, at close proximity and thus allowing for greater land use efficiency. Solutions for joining the work of multiple ground stations to a single, more efficient generator are discussed. Software for kite network design is discussed. The designs are licensed as open source hardware to encourage engagement. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios—low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)—demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities. © 2018 by the authors.

The use of a low-frame-rate camera provides on the one hand a high-resolution sensor with a relatively low-cost hardware but imposes, on the other, the adoption of a down-sampling approach, which is applicable only when a single (known) sinusoidal load is applied to the structure. The effectiveness of the proposed setup has been verified by the 3D vibration measurement of two different targets up to a frequency of 1 kHz, corresponding to a displacement amplitude of 0.01 mm. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: A toy UAV performs tumbling, rolling, racing and other complex activities. It is based on low-cost hardware and hence requires a better algorithm to estimate the attitudes more accurately with low power consumption. The proposed technique based on optimized Madgwick filter and moving average filter (MAF) ensures improved convergence speed in estimating the attitude, achieves higher accuracy and provides robustness and stability of the toy UAV. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: Traditional methods are prone to problems such as slow convergence speed and errors in calculation of the attitude angles. These errors cause the vehicle to drift and tremble, thus affecting the overall stability of the vehicle. The proposed method combines the features of optimized Madgwick filter and MAF to provide better accuracy, achieved through the fusion of gyroscope and accelerometer data, and zero correction to eliminate the random drift error of the gyroscope and removal of high-frequency interference by MAF of the accelerometer data. The experimental results on actual flight data showed that the method was better than the conventional Madgwick and Mahony complementary filters. Findings: The performance of the proposed method was analyzed by estimating the pitch and roll angles under the static and dynamic condition of the toy UAV. The results were compared with two traditional methods: Madgwick and Mahony complement filter. In the static condition, the variance and average error while estimating the attitudes was comparatively lower than the traditional method. For the dynamic conditions, the convergence time to achieve a prescribed swing angle was again lower than the traditional method. From these two experiments, it can be seen that the proposed method provides better attitude estimation at lower computation time. Originality/value: The proposed method combines the optimized Madgwick filter and MAF to accuracy estimate the attitude of toy UAV. The algorithm mainly suits the toy UAVs which are based on low-cost hardware and require better control systems to ensure stability of the vehicle. The experimental results on real flight data illustrate that the method not only improves the convergence speed in estimating the attitude angle for large maneuvers of the toy UAV, but also achieves higher accuracy in the attitude estimation, thus ensuring the robustness and stability of the UAV. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This process is by no means trivial and the acquisition of high quality point cloud representations of dynamic 3D objects is still an open problem. In this paper, an approach for high fidelity 3D point cloud generation using low cost 3D sensing hardware is presented. The proposed approach runs in an efficient low-cost hardware setting based on several Kinect v2 scanners connected to a single PC. It performs autocalibration and runs in real-time exploiting an efficient composition of several filtering methods including Radius Outlier Removal (ROR), Weighted Median filter (WM) and Weighted Inter-Frame Average filtering (WIFA). The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated through efficient acquisition of dense 3D point clouds of moving objects. © 2018 Copyright SPIE.},

abstract={Radar is an electronic device which utilizes electromagnetic waves to determine the altitude, range, direction, or speed of both moving and immovable objects. In contrast, ultrasonic waves are used instead of electromagnetic waves in ultrasonic radar. The low power consumption, low cost and ease of implementation are considered the main features of the ultrasonic radar to be devoted in several applications such as security purposes, object detection and avoidance systems in robotics. This work presents a design and implementation of ultrasonic radar for distance measurements. The design consists of an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino board as a controller, a servo motor and a java application. The detection range of the proposed system is tested up to 500 cm with the angle of rotation from (0 to +180) and (180 to 0) degrees for different types of obstacles or objects (sponge, wood an aluminum). The design is built using open source hardware (Arduino Uno 328) which is coded via Micro C environment as a software entity. The effectiveness of the proposed design is measured using a statistical analysis of the distance error between the radar and the obstacles. The results obtained for all types of obstacles are tabled and graphed to prove that a very small error can be achieved using the proposed design. © 2018 Haraa Raheem Hatem et. al.},

Scale space capillary detectors (SCD) is proposed for detection of capillaries under such conditions, which is a unique combination of anisotropic diffusion and Harris corner detector. SCD is followed by Ordinate clustering algorithm (OCA) which is used to eliminate outliers in the detected capillaries. Nailfold capillary images are obtained from a low-cost digital microscope under varying lighting conditions to form a custom database.

abstract={This paper focuses on target localization problem in a multistation redundancy system which finds broad applications in sonar, radar, and location-based service. Previous solutions can only be applied to the minimum system, such as the TOA method with three sensors and the AOA method with two sensors or need matrix inversion. To solve this problem, we propose a simple closed-form solution for a multistation redundancy localization system by using the estimation variance as the weighting coefficient to compute an average of each group's localization result. The proposed method, with simple algebraic solution, requires no matrix inversion and can be used for low-cost hardware devices. We derive the method in TOA solution and AOA solution, respectively. The proposed method can also be extended to other locating technologies. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method in root-mean-square error. The positioning accuracy of the proposed method is close to Cramér-Rao low bound both in TOA solution and AOA solution. © 2018 Xiwen Zhang et al.},

abstract={Localisation and navigation are essential tasks for a mobile robot. If a mobile robot knows where it is, then it can make a plan to reach its destination. Localisation and navigation processes are not isolated from each other, they are closely linked. In fact, the ability for a mobile robot to localise itself is a basic requirement for reliable long-range autonomous navigation. Using sensory information about its environment, the mobile robot can perform actions dependent on this sensory information and navigate around. Although highly accurate localisation and mapping using low-cost hardware is very difficult, the emergence of new sensor technologies and development of state-of-the-art localisation and navigation algorithms help researchers and practitioners to realise their goals. In this study we evaluate the effects of speed and measurement variance on the accuracy of mobile robot localisation. As the results of our simulation studies prove, increasing speed and measurement variance of a mobile robot results in higher position error and velocity error. This indicates that high robot speed and high measurement variances may significantly reduce the accuracy of localisation algorithms. © SGEM 2018.},

abstract={A novel application of photogrammetry is consisting in measurement of microfeatures. 3D model reconstruction, high resolution measurement and good accuracy can be obtain with a low cost equipment. However, in order to obtain high performance in measurement, 3D geometry obtained by photogrammetry needs to be calibrated for setting the scaling factor. Using commercial software, the scale is commonly retrieved through two different procedures: the first one consists in using a known distance between two markers within the images, the second procedure consists in placing the camera/s in known positions. Both procedures need accurate and expensive facilities when the photogrammetry is applied on microfeatures measurement. In the present work an automatic and low cost method to find the correct scale factor for a photogrammetric 3D model applied at micro-scale is presented. The method is based on automatically retrieving blurring area combined with Depth from Focus method. © 2018 CURRAN-CONFERENCE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We present a method for microfluidic channel fabrication that has the following advantages compared to conventionally-used methods: technical simplicity, dramatically lower fabrication costs, and fabrication time. The method entails printing channel designs on a thermoplastic film from a LaserJet printer. Exposure to high temperatures elicits isotropic shrinkage of the film (in the x-y plane), in addition to thickening (in the z-direction), resulting in a positive relief mold. The microfluidic channel design of the mold is then transferred to a polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) chip through soft lithography, resulting in a ready-to-use microfluidic chip. Through this approach, chips with complex channel geometries can be generated with low cost equipment and in as little as a couple hours.

abstract={Pan-Tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras are well suited to motion detection and tracking objects due to their mobility. Motion detection approaches based on background difference have been the most used with fixed cameras because of the high quality of the achieved segmentation. However, time requirements and high costs prevent most of the algorithms proposed in literature from exploiting the background difference with PTZ cameras in real world applications, such as automatic surveillance. This paper presents a new algorithm to detect moving objects within an area covered by a PTZ camera while it is panning, tilting or zooming in or out. The low computational demands of the algorithm allow for its deployment to a Raspberry Pi microcontroller-based board, which enables the design and implementation of a low-cost monitoring system that is able to perform real-Time image processing. First, our system works offline to estimate the parameters of the motion detection model, which are written on the Raspberry Pi memory. Second, motion detection is performed online by the microcontroller. Experimental results using different moving objects classifiers (FANN, KNN, and SVM) confirm the good performance of this approach in terms of different classification performance measures (accuracy, F-measure, AUC, and sample processing time). © 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={This chapter connects directly to the current state of research on innovation communities and discusses their institutional foundations, their implementation in the context of fields, as well as their practical implications in terms of agency and entrepreneurship. Against this background, I attempt to grasp innovation communities as a distinct type of meso-level order. Here, the general conflicts that shape the institutional foundations of collective innovation play out in the context of gradually settled fields, where community and business logics compete over the legitimate ways to shape the particular innovation at stake. Consequently, the resulting fields reflect an ambiguous institutional environment that affects not only the general conditions under which innovation communities create and develop potentially innovative artifacts (like 3D printers), but also the particular opportunities and struggles that accompany corresponding approaches for commercial exploitation. As the dilemma of entrepreneurship in open hardware usually refers to community members that develop entrepreneurial ambitions to commercialize community-based innovations, Chap. 3 also emphasizes the micro level of individual actors and their agentic capacities to relieve tensions within a complex and potentially contradictive institutional environment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Scaling up robot swarms to collectives of hundreds or even thousands without sacrificing sensing, processing, and locomotion capabilities is a challenging problem. Low-cost robots are potentially scalable, but the majority of existing systems have limited capabilities, and these limitations substantially constrain the type of experiments that could be performed by robotics researchers. Instead of adding functionality by adding more components and therefore increasing the cost, we demonstrate how low-cost hardware can be used beyond its standard functionality. We systematically review 15 swarm robotic systems and analyse their sensing capabilities by applying a general sensor model from the sensing and measurement community. This work is based on the HoverBot system. A HoverBot is a levitating circuit board that manoeuvres by pulling itself towards magnetic anchors that are embedded into the robot arena. We show that HoverBot's magnetic field readouts from its Hall-effect sensor can be associated to successful movement, robot rotation and collision measurands. We build a time series classifier based on these magnetic field readouts. We modify and apply signal processing techniques to enable the online classification of the time-variant magnetic field measurements on HoverBot's low-cost microcontroller. We enabled HoverBot with successful movement, rotation, and collision sensing capabilities by utilising its single Hall-effect sensor. We discuss how our classification method could be applied to other sensors to increase a robot's functionality while retaining its cost. © 2018 Nemitz, Stokes, Marcotte, E.

abstract={Applying the capabilities of the Internet of Things holds particular promise for advancing certain of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, citizens in many developing countries lack access to energy, and suffer from a lack of energy independence, scarcity, and high energy costs. Efforts are underway to make energy generation, transmission, and consumption more efficient via the application of modern communications and control. In this paper we focus on a communications and demand-side control application for legacy appliances. Instead of replacing existing devices with new “smart” devices with better communications capability, we integrate legacy devices into a centralized control system. We designed and implemented a communications system that allows control of infrared-enabled appliances over a network using wired or wireless communications. We designed a web application and user interface that can function remotely over the Internet, and use microcontrollers and infrared transmitters to communicate with infrared-enabled devices. We demonstrate a prototype of the system to control air conditioning units in a commercial building for energy management. The system uses open source hardware, software, and protocols. While we use energy management as an example, we focus on the general communications and control architecture, which is easily scalable and applicable to other devices and applications beyond those demonstrated here. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Throughout the world there are cities with historic buildings or monuments to visit and one of the great challenges is to make residents aware of the value and representativeness of these constructions for the preservation of the local culture. In this context heritage education should start early with initiatives involving elementary school children. Nowadays children have access to technological devices such as smartphones or tablets from a very early age, and therefore, the use of these resources can be valid to aid in heritage education. That is why some alternatives have been researched to offer virtual visits through some device or technological resource. Several companies have developed equipment capable of simulating virtual environments or superimposing information in the real world with great quality, but with very high prices. Undergraduate students in Architecture of the University Center of João Pessoa - UNIPÊ and public elementary school students worked together on this project, developed considering the use of low cost equipment, printed on 3D printers and using free software.

abstract={Low-cost biosensors combined with low-cost portable devices can be very useful in time critical situations of mass casualties, when fast triage procedure must be attained. A methodology that uses ECG to derive the vital parameters (heart rate and respiratory rate) needed for the triage procedure is presented and it is aimed to leverage affordable low-cost equipment that can be easily utilized by urgent medical units or even volunteers in events of considerable number of injured civilians. The methodology relies on selected well-known and published algorithms for heart rate and respiratory rate derivation from a given ECG signal. It consists of methods for R-wave detection, kurtosis computation, smoothing, and finding peaks. The proposed approach is shown to offer a good trade-off between the accurate measurement of the parameters and their fast derivation. It has been evaluated by using a publicly available database. Its robustness is measured in terms of accuracy estimation, showing a sensitivity of 0.87 for heart rate and 0.74 for respiratory rate, a sensitivity of 0.76 considering the triage process and an average-case execution time of 0.02 seconds, making it suitable for real-time applications. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

Well-known are the professional fields of Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Innovation, as well as academic research. At its core, documentation is about transferring information beyond one specific project team, site or time frame. We specifically explore Participatory Design projects, wherein this type of information exchange remains a challenge for many researchers. From a literature study about how to support making documentation in Open Source Software and Hardware practices, we learn how to elicit skill building and intrinsic motivation. We complement these insights with two Participatory Design practices that already use a form of documentation, i.e. design games and sensitizing. We distinguish five characteristics that designers can use to implement documentation in the design process by balancing between skill building and intrinsic motivation, and propose the concept of ‘documentation games’ as a format supporting this. We exemplify this approach through three case studies and assess how the five characteristics and the documentation games provide handholds to include documentation to support long-term engagements in participatory design processes. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Oswald Devisch, Liesbeth Huybrechts, Roel De Ridder.},

abstract={The ever-increasing flood of information, especially in the medical-clinical field, inter alia due to the increase of data-intensive mobile/wearable devices, is one of the biggest challenges of medical informatics. In this work different possibilities of the integration of wearable devices on the example of the development of a fall prevention system are presented and classified. We started with a commercial off-the-shelf one-on-one system (Shimmer/Arduino) using a Bluetooth connection, integrated via nurse call system as Human-Machine-Interface. During the evaluation of the system we mentioned several new requirements and optimization possibilities. Thus, we adjusted the hardware-software-system; the near-field communication was realized by IEEE802.15.4, we replaced commercial off-the-shelf devices with highly-specialized open hardware in-house developments and we transferred the nurse call integration by setting up our own network and integrating this into an existing (wireless) local area network. With this development, the energy-efficient, simple and intuitive mechanisms of proximity communication via IEEE802.15.4 can be combined with the benefits broadband functionalities, e.g. of Wi-Fi, with both worlds benefits and the compensation of some disadvantages. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={OMV Austria E&P GmbH operates approximately 650 artificially lifted oil wells with an average water cut (WC) of 96% in the area of lower Austria. The majority of these wells is produced with sucker rod pumps (SRP - 76%), gas lift (GL - 16%) and electrical submersible pumps (ESP - 8%). Especially well interventions for equipment replacements due to corrosion, associated gas and sand production represent the main cost drivers to the operating expenditures for mature fields. Current commodity prices are the main driving force behind cost-centric strategies where cost efficient equipment optimization is the key to improve run life and therefore reduce operating costs. The challenge is to extend the run life of the artificial lift system without adverse effects on the oil production rates. The foundation for any low cost equipment optimization is built on detailed in-house failure analysis. Therefore the existing inspection procedures of SRPs and GL in the own pump workshop was revised; additionally a workflow for ESPs was initiated and implemented. Based on the results of these measures the most frequent failure reasons were identified and possible mitigations were analyzed. The measures include design modifications, a stricter quality assurance of new equipment, material upgrades and special parts for the respective production environment. Furthermore, an economic assessment of the life cycle cost was conducted to quantify the cost impact. The continuous study already improved the run life significantly, thereby reducing the amount of well interventions and deferred production. The new integrated approach of failure analysis, design modifications and quality assurance offered valuable information to prevent recurrent systematic equipment failures. © 2018 Deutsche Wissens.

abstract={Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W/m2. An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices. © 2018 International Journal of Thermodynamics.

abstract={This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8WPV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Modern ultrasonic phased-array controllers are electronic systems capable of delaying the transmitted or received signals of multiple transducers. Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However, emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and π/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Different scientific communities face the challenge of the so called reproducibility crisis. In engineering and geotechnical engineering in particular this is not discussed in detail. However, research in soil mechanics is often done with highly specialized and expensive equipment. This research can not repeated or the testing methodology is seldom applied with a different soil type due to the availability of the testing protocol and equipment. Nowadays, the increasing accessibility of 3-D printing facilities, single-board computer and micro-controllers lead to new opportunities and ways to overcome this challenges. The aim of this contribution is to shed some light on this facts and discuss opportunities to improve the scientific situation with respect of open science in soil mechanics. To the authors best knowledge this is a novel application of Open Science in geotechnical engineering. The developed device is called Open Science interface shear device (OSInterface), which will act as a pilot project to demonstrate the opportunities using methods that are applied for example for open source software development in open hardware development with a focus to geotechnical engineering. Basically, this interface shear device differs not much from existing shear devices but the development and the construction is accessible to everyone. The different aspects of such a development based on the OSInterface are discussed and also the challenges are addressed. The idea is to motivate many different researchers to rebuild the OSinterface device and share their own developments. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Earthquake effects are strongly related with the properties of the local geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17–0.63% (0.05–0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65–9.38% (2.15–3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes’ jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population. © 2018, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

abstract={Urban environments introduce a challenge for unaided GNSS to provide accurate coordinates at all times, which makes this approach insufficient for many applications. Recent developments in intelligent transportation systems lead to an evolution of such techniques as map matching, 3D map aiding, shadow matching, and visual-aided navigation. These methods along with inertial-sensor integration proved to improve the capability of low-cost-equipment-based precise positioning applications. The plethora of available sensors allows devices to collect rich contextual data and permits the user to adapt the positioning engine parameters to different environments. The limitation of past research using a single positioning platform is that context detection is solved independently, based on self-monitoring. Individual device sensor readings are prone to being affected by random errors and to increase the reliability of context detection, multiple readings should be made, which is not feasible in many real-time applications. In an urban setting, it is reasonable to assume that many identical platforms will collect similar sensor readings when operating in a given area. The research described in this paper aims to explore the use of collectively recorded context information with further processing, integrating the data with a map and feeding the summarized results to a user. A two-week piloting dataset in a dense urban environment was collected with two low-cost positioning boards with the same hardware and firmware configuration. It was shown in previous research that the signal-to-noise ratio measurement is a sufficient metric to distinguish not only between indoor and outdoor environments, but to detect signal jamming events and to characterise the quality of the GNSS signal reception in the area. The uniformity of the configuration of the devices allowed for reliable spatial mapping of the signal-to-noise-ratio measurements. The novel contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the implemented architecture capable of continuous real-time context mapping is described. Second, a context map-aided measurements noise adjustment algorithm is designed. Third, the benefits of the context-database-aiding are demonstrated in the case of pure GNSS coordinate determination. © 2018 Institute of Navigation. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Any hydrological model starts with collecting relevant hydrometeorological data to run the model. Despite the importance of hydrological models for water resource management and disaster risk reduction, the adequacy of the hydrometeorological stations and their locations play a significant role in generating reliable model outputs. Although World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends minimum station densities for different physiographic areas with some detailed standards on siting and calibrating the instruments used in the stations, it doesn't provide any guideline to select optimum locations to deploy the stations. The adequacy of the stations vary with the weather condition of the area and the measured parameters. Since some of the most widely used parameters in hydrological modelling, such as precipitation can vary greatly with small distances, in reality, the required density is higher than the recommended density by the WMO. This research was conducted in a period where the University of Moratuwa of Sri Lanka is conducting a research project called 4ONSE (4 times Open and Non-Conventional technology for Sensing the Environment) in collaboration with University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland. The project involves deploying low cost, open technologies (open hardware, software, data and standards) based hydrometeorological stations in Deduru Oya river basin of Sri Lanka. The process of determining the optimum locations for the stations started with discretizing the watershed into sub-basins. Satellite retrieved weather data was applied in Shannon's Entropy method to measure the spatial distribution of uncertainty levels of precipitation. In addition, requirements of the hydrological modeling software (SWAT) and several other factors were considered in determining the number and the locations for the stations. The method presented in this research is an experimental approach of deploying the 4ONSE stations in real world. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018},

abstract={Open platform architecture products (OPAP) are the key enablers for Product design for Mass Individualisation. It is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform, mass-produced by large manufacturers and multiple independent modules, invented and produced by other smaller companies and by the end-user that are integrated with the platform. It gives freedom to end-users to integrate different modules into the platform as per their choice. This type of product integration will be engaged with by the all actors involved in the design and aims to help them to be more creative and innovative. The end product will be highly individualised and technologically advanced. Based on explorative literature analysis, with practical insights from an industrial questionnaire survey, an Innovation toolkit for the end-user has been developed. The Innovation toolkit provides a mean of selecting an optimal module option for each module which will be integrated on the hardware platform. The design of the Innovation toolkit for OPAP has been approached in three different steps: Modelling of OPAP, Modelling of evaluation measures and evaluation indices with end-user preferences and Identification of the optimal module options. In this work, variations in module options for a given module are modelled by an AND-OR tree and parameters of the nodes in this tree. Different module options for the selected module are evaluated by various evaluation measures. These evaluation measures are converted into comparable customer satisfaction indices. The optimal OPAP is identified by constrained optimisation of the overall customer satisfaction index. Two case studies have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced Innovation toolkit. These case studies illustrate that the Innovation toolkit can readily be applied to these types of product development to obtain a highly individualised OPAP with optimised module options. © Proceedings of NordDesign: Design in the Era of Digitalization, NordDesign 2018.

abstract={In the last years the popularity and with that performance of COTS single-board computers and systems-on-a-chip (SoC) with partially open designs and software systems like the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or BeagleBoard raised significantly. Thanks to their wide availability, low price, and open adaptability they are widely used in broad communities among makers and artists as well as in schools and universities. They can serve as scientific platforms e.g. as interfaces, sensor data handling or distributed computing platforms. Due to the large spread and user number, as well as the accessibility of the design, bugs are likely to be found and patched, leaving a reliable system. A variety of open source operating systems and programs with a multitude of easy to use libraries decreases the complexity in the development of new soft- and hardware. This offers the great opportunity even in space business to use them as an engineering model, to build laboratory breadboards, or as an experimental platform. Beside the evolution of the boards also the requirements for on-board computers and payload data handling units have increased considerably, even on very small satellites. Computers like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone are able to increase computational power and at the same time decreasing size, mass, complexity, and power consumption. They are very well suited for tasks such as image processing, handling of large data, or operation in general. When being able to use them as flight model directly development time and system adaptations can be decreased to a minimum. We tested both Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone modules. This paper focuses on the characterization and total ionizing dose (TID) test of the smallest board in the BeagleBone family, the PocketBeagle. The PocketBeagle has a footprint comparable to a matchbox and hosts an 1 GHz ARM processor with 512 MB RAM and integrated power management. Besides the ARM-SoC the PocketBeagle only hosts a SD-card memory slot and a USB interface. We will describe the test setup, parameters, and routines during the test campaign. Further we will present the characterization and discuss the performance during and after the TID test. The TID of this test was equivalent to a 2-years mission in LEO. The SoC on the PocketBeagle passed the tests. This paper is a step towards trusting and using open source technology and COTS systems in space. Copyright © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Future exploration missions in space between the Earth and the Moon or beyond will require complex operational activities to ensure that crew, cargo, and exploration systems reach their destination safely and successfully. NASA is committed to engaging citizen scientists with opportunities to develop novel solutions that can assist in bridging technology gaps related to human spaceflight. Four years ago, NASA entered into a Space Act Agreement with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Foundation to inspire students with real-world engineering problems through a series of engineering challenges that leverage the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration aboard the International Space Station (ISS). With technical assistance from NASA, ASME designs and conducts K-12 engineering design challenges using the Future Engineers challenge platform allowing participants to use their imaginations and 3D modeling software to design items related to future space exploration missions. The Future Engineers web presence hosts challenges, provides links to free modeling software, and features an open hardware design repository showcasing student software models. At the end of each challenge, a committee that includes NASA personnel and experts on 3D printing in space, reviews all submissions and selects several designs for final review. Finalists are then interviewed by a judging panel with winners selected in Junior (ages 5-12) and Teen (ages 13-19) age divisions. Through this innovative collaboration, winners have received behind-the-scenes tours of NASA, SpaceX, Bigelow Aerospace, Digital Domain, and MakerBot, and had their designs printed on the 3D printer aboard the ISS. Since 2014, the challenges have successfully engaged over 2,700 students from 46 states to use their imaginations to design and create 3D engineering models related to items astronauts may need in the future. Thirty-nine percent of participants are female, a traditionally underrepresented group in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers. This paper provides an overview of received submissions, winning designs, success stories, and lessons learned. It will also detail the relationship, the unique assets of each organization, and the roles of each in implementing the challenges. We share details on the management, promotion, summative information about participants, and next steps for the effort. The projects resulting from these Future Engineers challenges have greatly surpassed expectations, increased NASA's body of knowledge in In-Space Manufacturing, and inspired and engaged the next generation of space explorers.

abstract={Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks, can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Urban electrical distribution networks are mostly comprised of Medium Voltage (MV) ring distribution feeders to improve reliability. Transformers connected to MV feeders transfer power from MV network to Low Voltage (LV) distribution networks. In underground LV distribution networks, feeder pillars are used to branch out LV feeders emerging from distribution transformers. Currently, the existing distribution systems have several issues that affect reliability and power quality. This paper proposes a low-cost distribution monitoring system developed using low-cost hardware and a MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) software stack, which cater to requirements of Sri Lankan distribution utilities. Monitoring units that can be installed on LV feeder pillars are used to monitor LV electrical parameters and the condition of fuses of the feeder pillar. Data acquired from monitoring units are periodically transmitted to a remote TCP server using GPRS and then used to estimate power parameters of MV network, to detect faults, monitor trends and calculate system reliability parameters. The TCP server records all collected data in a database. A HTTP server is used to provide a user interface that can be used to view recorded data and processed information on a web-based interface. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditionally unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) have been large, complex and expensive. Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It focuses on a new compact affordable UUV. In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter, 40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a depth of 300 meters. This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and open software interfaces and use of modern three - dimensional design and printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the range of this compact vehicle to nearly 1000km. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.},

abstract={Robotics has been used to draw the attention of young students to computing and engineering. Unfortunately, most hardware and software resources used to teach programming and robotics are not adequate for students with visual impairment (VI). For instance, most programming environments for young students are highly visual and the commercial robotics kits were not built for people with VI. This paper describes the main design requirements so that both the proposed robot hardware and the software can also be used by people with VI. The hardware part is the focus of this paper, a robot called Donnie. It consists of open hardware, a design with low-cost and easy to find parts, and a 3D printed structure. Our main contribution is the presentation of a low-cost Arduino-based robot, compatible with Player robotic framework and integrated with sound feedback and text-to-speech. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A new analytical procedure, based on liquid chromatography with diode array and fluorescence detection, has been proposed for the determination of bioactive compounds in vegetables and spices after hard cap espresso extraction. This novel extraction system has been tested for the determination of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin from fresh chilli and sweet pepper, piperine from ground pepper, curcumin from turmeric and curry, and myristicin from nutmeg. Extraction efficiency was evaluated by using acetonitrile:water and ethanol:water mixtures. The proposed method allows the extraction of samples with 100 mL of 60% (v/v) ethanol in water. The obtained limits of quantification for the proposed procedure ranged from 0.07 to 0.30 mg g−1 and results were statistically comparable with those obtained by ultrasound assisted extraction. Hard cap espresso machines offer a fast, effective and quantitative tool for the extraction of bioactive compounds from food samples with an extraction time lower than 30 s, using a global available and low cost equipment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Enabled by modern languages and retargetable compilers, software development is in a virtual 'Cambrian explosion' driven by a critical mass of powerfully parameterized libraries; but hardware development practices lag far behind. We hypothesize that existing hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses, optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Within the genus Populus, about 30 species are classified into six sections, of which some are cross-compatible. Besides naturally occurring hybrids, huge breeding programs have led to a high number of artificially produced hybrids, for which the determination of genetically involved species by morphological characteristics is often difficult. This necessitates the use of molecular markers for the identification of both maternal as well as paternal species, and in the case of complex hybrids, the genealogy. For this reason, we developed new chloroplast and nuclear markers for the differentiation of up to 19 poplar species, with one to 32 individuals per species regularly used in breeding programs based on already known barcoding, other chloroplast regions, and nuclear genes of interest. We developed methods to identify species by either species-specific nucleotide variations or, when no initial information for the species was given, by using a set of markers either in a procedure of exclusion or in a multiplexed marker set. The developed markers can all be used with low-cost equipment, and some can additionally be applied using a genetic analyzer. We combined these markers in multiplexes for a very fast and easy-to-use application for the identification of poplar species and their hybrids. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Background: Quantifying the strength of the intrinsic foot muscles has been a challenge for clinicians and researchers. The reliable measurement of this strength is important in order to assess weakness, which may contribute to a variety of functional issues in the foot and lower leg, including plantar fasciitis and hallux valgus. This study reports 3 novel methods for measuring foot strength - doming (previously unmeasured), hallux flexion, and flexion of the lesser toes. Methods: Twenty-one healthy volunteers performed the strength tests during two testing sessions which occurred one to five days apart. Each participant performed each series of strength tests (doming, hallux flexion, and lesser toe flexion) four times during the first testing session (twice with each of two raters) and two times during the second testing session (once with each rater). Intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated to test for reliability for the following comparisons: between raters during the same testing session on the same day (inter-rater, intra-day, intra-session), between raters on different days (inter-rater, inter-day, inter-session), between days for the same rater (intra-rater, inter-day, inter-session), and between sessions on the same day by the same rater (intra-rater, intra-day, inter-session). Results: ICCs showed good to excellent reliability for all tests between days, raters, and sessions. Average doming strength was 99.96±47.04N. Average hallux flexion strength was 65.66±24.5N. Average lateral toe flexion was 50.96±22.54N. Conclusions: These simple tests using relatively low cost equipment can be used for research or clinical purposes. If repeated testing will be conducted on the same participant, it is suggested that the same researcher or clinician perform the testing each time for optimal reliability. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper discusses about the trajectory planning and controlled maneuvering of the vehicle in parking assist mode. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to use low-cost hardware like ultrasonic sensor in order to provide automated parking assist to the vehicle. The concept of grid occupancy is formulated in free space detection algorithm to compute lateral-longitudinal grid cell vacancy. The vehicle will enable automated parking assist mode for controlled maneuvering on completion of free space detection followed by path planning. The reference planned path is an optimized trajectory with single maneuver for the vehicle to traverse in a free parking space. The localized trajectory and control algorithm of the perpendicular parking have been designed with reference to perception sensor input. The controller facilitates the intelligent navigation of vehicle based on measured obstacle free clearance distance and reference point. The steering control algorithm based on fuzzy logic is designed to provide an optimized maneuvering of the host vehicle in perpendicular parking space. In order to ease parking effort, an innovative approach of combined feedback and feed-forward based fuzzy controller has been illustrated. The controller performance has been evaluated in simulation environment keeping vehicle dynamics model in loop. The test scenario has been modeled in Carmaker to substantiate the optimization of route selection and a smooth transition of vehicle in parking assist mode during maneuvering into an empty parking space. © 2017 IEEE.},

After one year of development, SDX-L2 and BoD, the SDN-ization of the GÉANT Open and Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) services, have been brought to the pilot status and GÉANT is now testing the outcomes on its operational network. In this demonstration, we show BoD and SDX-L2”going live” at the GÉANT production infrastructure. The pilots run on the same underlay infrastructure thanks to the virtualization capabilities of the network devices. Provisioning of the services is covered during the demo.

Ubiquitous computing turned out to be a fact that has many unutilized resources. These unutilized resources can be used to create Ad-hoc Cloud. In this paper, we create a novel mobile ad-hoc cloud based on a network of inter-connected low cost, small size, resource constrained and widely available devices. We present a novel application to detect criminals using low cost equipment. This way the application can be considered a method that compensates the total cost that was needed for creating the cloud infrastructure and operational cost.

abstract={This paper deals with the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) problem. The main objective is to limit it by controlling the main reasons that may lead to it. Sudden infant death syndrome is the death without specific reason of a healthy newborn, usually during sleep. Although the causes are unknown, SIDS may be related to abnormalities in the infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep. Researchers have identified several measures that increase the risk on their babies. Thus, this paper proposes a low cost system that may help in monitoring the baby vital signs responsible for the SIDS and sending notifications to parents when abnormalities are encountered. The system is based on a microcontroller that regroups all sensors' outputs and a mobile application that displays these values, controls the video coming from a camera and send notifications in case of abnormal signals. The system was tested over 10 newborns (between 1 month and 2 years) over 3 weeks and the alarms were going well. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The importance of quality of the measured values is very dependent on the device that measures these values: the size of the sample, the time of measurement, periods of measurement, the mobility and the robustness of the device, etc. Contemporary devices intended for the measurement of physical quantities that are on the market vary in price, as well as and the quality of the measured values. The rule "the more expensive the better" is not necessarily always a rule that is valid because it all depends on the characteristics and capabilities of the device, and the customer's needs. In this paper, a device based on "Open Source" components of hardware and software will be presented. Device was used to measure voltages and currents on low voltage networks, on which a virtually unlimited number of sensors can be added, and the device is assembled of components available on electronic components Internet.

abstract={Excluding the ion source, an ion mobility spectrometer is fundamentally comprised of drift chamber, ion gate, pulsing electronics, and a mechanism for amplifying and recording ion signals. Historically, the solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled, MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output of this circuit follows a TTL signal with ~20 ns rise and fall times, pulses up to +/− 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental efforts for future comparison. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Using a camera, a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) can perform visual-based navigation in periods or circumstances when GPS is not available, or when it is partially available. In this context, the monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods represent an excellent alternative, due to several limitations regarding to the design of the platform, mobility and payload capacity that impose considerable restrictions on the available computational and sensing resources of the MAV. However, the use of monocular vision introduces some technical difficulties as the impossibility of directly recovering the metric scale of the world. In this work, a novel monocular SLAM system with application to MAVs is proposed. The sensory input is taken from a monocular downward facing camera, an ultrasonic range finder and a barometer. The proposed method is based on the theoretical findings obtained from an observability analysis. Experimental results with real data confirm those theoretical findings and show that the proposed method is capable of providing good results with low-cost hardware. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Waste-heat recovery from discharged slurries can improve the net raw biogas production in the bio-methane process in order to meet the demand for a next-generation of anaerobic digestion. In this study, a numerical model of a scraped-surface heat exchanger was proposed with the consideration of the complete and precise rheological behaviour of the slurry of animal manure for the first time for achieving highly efficient waste-heat recovery. The rheological model results were verified with new experimental data measured in this work. Subsequently, the convective heat-transfer coefficient of the scraped-surface heat exchanger was calculated numerically with the proposed numerical model, and the performance was determined. Then, the contributions of waste-heat recovery from the slurry to the biogas production using a general shell-and-tube heat exchanger and the scraped-surface heat exchanger were calculated quantitatively and compared. For the case of scraped-surface heat exchanger, the increase of net raw biogas production can be up to 8.53%, which indicates that there is a great potential to increase the net raw biogas production in the bio-methane process using a scraped-surface heat exchanger with low-cost equipment and a compactible structure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The advantages in relation to traditional methods are portability, low cost and detection of mixed frauds. The experiments were conducted in dairy plants at Governador Valadares, in Brazil. The results were compared with cryoscopy and chloride tests. It is demonstrated there is high correlation between MilkTech and Cryoscopy. For instance, the detection limit of the equipment for water addition with the set of analyzed data was 0.78% with precision of 1.1%. Adulterations with sodium chloride, caustic soda, ethyl alcohol and sodium bicarbonate are detected qualitatively, even when added with water, and MilkTech indicates “SUSPECT” milk. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA.

abstract={High-speed broadband services require optical fibres in access networks, in which multiple subscribers are connected to service providers, to satisfy the continuously growing bandwidth demand. The primitive signaling scheme used in access networks enables the use of low-cost equipment but diminishes the bandwidth available to end-users. Thus, current technology will be unable to support future broadband demands. Coherent communication systems offer significantly improved power- and bandwidth-efficiency, but require fundamental simplifications to become economically viable for access networks. Here, we demonstrate a promising simplified coherent receiver exhibiting a robust performance against polarisation fluctuations over an installed fibre network. It enables the realisation of high-order modulation formats and offers high sensitivities, achieving a four-fold increase in the supported number of subscribers and approximately doubling the transmission distance compared to the recently standardized access technology. The proposed solution indicates that digital coherent technology can be feasible and transform the access networks, enabling ubiquitous new services and applications with uncontended, multi-gigabits/user broadband connections. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The spreading of urban areas and the growth of human population worldwide raise societal and environmental concerns. To better address these concerns, the monitoring of the acoustic environment in urban as well as rural or wilderness areas is an important matter. Building on the recent development of low cost hardware acoustic sensors, we propose in this paper to consider a sensor grid approach to tackle this issue. In this kind of approach, the crucial question is the nature of the data that are transmitted from the sensors to the processing and archival servers. To this end, we propose an efficient audio coding scheme based on third octave band spectral representation that allows: (1) the estimation of standard acoustic indicators; and (2) the recognition of acoustic events at state-of-the-art performance rate. The former is useful to provide quantitative information about the acoustic environment, while the latter is useful to gather qualitative information and build perceptually motivated indicators using for example the emergence of a given sound source. The coding scheme is also demonstrated to transmit spectrally encoded data that, reverted to the time domain using state-of-the-art techniques, are not intelligible, thus protecting the privacy of citizens. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={The rapid development of new classes of nanomaterials calls for easy access methods in order to quantify properties essential for their functionality, e.g., interdiffusion of elements at interfaces, or elemental dopant, or depth profiles. Non-destructive methods, like X-ray fluorescence (XRF), are of special interest, for preserving materials and offering the possibility to incorporate the analysis in a production process. In-depth XRF methods for the characterization of nanomaterials are up until now limited to synchrotron radiation facilities. A novel scan-free grazing emission XRF (GEXRF) setup is presented utilizing conventional and low-cost hardware, acting as a transfer of a synchrotron method into the laboratory. A chromium target X-ray tube with a polycapillary lens is used as X-ray source and a conventional CCD as the 2D energy-dispersive detector. To confirm the feasibility of the described setup a nanometer-layered titanium-aluminium sample is measured. An energy-dispersive spectrum is obtained in single-photon-counting-mode from the CCD measurements and first GEXRF profiles generated. A semi-quantitative evaluation of this setup is implemented by comparing the measured results with simulations, allowing conclusions about the investigated samples’ elemental, compositional, and structural layer-by-layer characteristics. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT. We categorize here the numerous existing solutions according to their objectives (e.g. high-reliability, mobility support) and approaches. We also identify some open challenges, expected to attract much attention over the next few years. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Achieving data-rates of multiple Gbps in 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mm-wave)communicationsystems requires efficient beam-steering algorithms. To find the optimal steering direction on IEEE 802.11ad compatible devices, state of-the-art approaches sweep through all predefined antenna sectors. Recently, much more efficient alternatives, such as compressive path tracking, have been proposed, which scale well even with arrays with thousands of antenna elements. However, such have not yet been integrated into consumer devices. In this work, we adapt compressive path tracking for sector selection in off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. In contrast to existing solutions, our compressive sector selection tolerates the imperfections of low-cost hardware, tracks beam directions in 3D and does not rely on pseudo-random beams. We implement our protocol on a commodity router, the TP-Link Talon AD7200, by modifying the sector sweep algorithm in the IEEE 802.11ad chip's firmware. In particular, we modify the firmware to obtain the signal strength of received frames and to select custom sectors. Using this extension, we precisely measure the device's sector patterns. We then select the best sector based on the measured patterns and sweep only through a subset of probing sectors. Our results demonstrate, that our protocol outperforms the existing sector sweep, increases stability, and speeds up the sector selection by factor 2.3. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Active chlorophyll a fluorescence is an essential tool for understanding photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses. Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (σPSII or σPSII'). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 μmol photons m-2s-1) and high (200 μmol photons m-2 s-1) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell-1 decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research. © © 2017 Hoadley and Warner.},

abstract={The advent of easy-to-use open source microcontrollers, off-the-shelf electronics and customizable manufacturing technologies has facilitated the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory equipment. In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming.

abstract={The race to achieve smart cities is producing a continuous effort to adapt new developments and knowledge, for administrations and citizens. Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In order to effectively plan both preparedness and response to emergency situations it is necessary to access and analyse timely information on plausible scenarios of occurrence of ongoing events. Scenario maps representing the estimated susceptibility, hazard or risk of occurrence of an event on a territory are hardly generated real time. In fact the application of physical or statistical models using environmental parameters representing current dynamic conditions is time consuming on low cost hardware equipment. To cope with this practical issue we propose an off line generation of scenario maps under diversified environmental dynamic parameters, and a geo-Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) to allow people in charge of emergency preparedness and response activities to flexibly discover, retrieve, fuse and visualize the most plausible scenarios that may happen given some ongoing or forecasted dynamic conditions influencing the event. The novelty described in this chapter is related with both the ability to interpret flexible queries in order to retrieve risk scenario maps that are related to the current situation and to show the most plausible worst and best scenarios that may occur in each elementary area of the territory. Although, the SDI proposal has been conceived and designed to support the management of distinct natural and man-made risks, in the proof of concept prototypal implementation the scenarios maps target wild fire events. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

Using standard calibrated instrumentation, commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing the results obtained from some commercial photovoltaic modules to the measurements given by an independently accredited laboratory. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Quantitative measurements of above-ground vegetation biomass are vital to a range of ecological and natural resource management applications. Remote-sensing techniques, such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and image-based point clouds, are potentially revolutionary techniques for measuring vegetation biomass and deriving other related, structural metrics for these purposes. Surface vegetation biomass (up to 25 cm) in pasture, forest, and woodland environments is estimated from a 3D point cloud derived from a small number of digital images. Volume is calculated, using the 3D cloud and regressed against dry weight to provide an estimate of biomass. Assessment of the method is made through comparison to 3D point clouds collected through TLS surveys. High correlation between destructively sampled biomass and vegetation volume derived from TLS and image-based point clouds in the pasture (TLS (Formula presented.), image based (Formula presented.)), dry grassy forest (TLS (Formula presented.), image based (Formula presented.)) and lowland forest (TLS (Formula presented.), image based (Formula presented.)) environments was found. Occlusion caused by standing vegetation in the woodland environment resulted in moderate correlation between TLS derived volume and biomass ((Formula presented.)). The effects of surrounding vegetation on the image-based technique resulted in 3D point clouds being resolved for only 40% of the samples in this environment. The results of this study demonstrate that image-based point cloud techniques are highly viable for the measurement of surface biomass. In contrast to TLS, volume and biomass data can be captured using low-cost equipment and relatively little expertise. © 2017 The Authors.

The objective has been to radiation harden existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) emergency luminaires to maximise lighting performance, without compromising IEC 60598-2-22 compliance. A systems level approach has been adopted, leading to the development of a diode bridge based AC/DC power converter. Modified COTS luminaires including this converter design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID using a Cobalt-60 source), with results of a subsequent photometric analysis presented. Following encouraging tests results, a reference design for the power converter has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to encourage manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for future research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED emergency lighting for accelerators with detailed studies at the component level for high power white LED devices and associated optical components. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, the availability of low-cost equipment capable of recording kinematic data during walking has facilitated the outdoor assessment of gait parameters, thus overcoming the limitations of three-dimensional instrumented gait analysis (3D-GA). The aim of this study is twofold: Firstly, to investigate whether a single sensor on the lower trunk could provide valid spatio-temporal parameters in level walking in normal-weight and obese adolescents compared to instrumented gait analysis (GA); secondly, to investigate whether the inertial sensor is capable of capturing the spatio-temporal features of obese adolescent gait. These were assessed in 10 obese and 8 non-obese adolescents using both a single inertial sensor on the lower trunk and an optoelectronic system. The parameters obtained were not statistically different in either normal-weight or obese participants between the two methods. Obese adolescents walked with longer stance and double support phase compared to normal-weight participants. The results showed that the inertial system is a valid means of evaluating spatio-temporal parameters in obese individuals. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

We present a funnel-shaped docking station equipped with a contactless high bandwidth link and the necessary equipment to enable autonomous homing and docking by combining acoustic and optical sensing. The proposed combination, using a range-only localization at far distances and a light beacon localization at short ranges ensures a reliable strategy enabled with low-cost equipment and minimal requirements on both the vehicle and the dock sides. Moreover, remote operation is demonstrated by integrating the system in a unified web interface to control underwater assets, thus allowing a user to operate the AUV remotely through Internet. The full system has been successfully validated with tests conducted in a harbor environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

The process intends to go one step beyond the current methods employed to inspect marine industrial infrastructures, shipwrecks, geological or benthic zones of special interest, based on the participation of divers and, in some cases, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The case study presented in this paper corresponds to the inspection of the sewage outfall in Palma de Mallorca, started after the detection of Cyanobacterium on the surrounding seafloor, a living organism which appearance indicates elevated concentration of nitrates and pollution in the water. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={When learning different control related concepts and methods, simulation is often used as a training tool; but, it does not have some real time characteristics of implementation like dealing with coding and PC resources, supervision, and communications. In some cases, implementation cannot be carried away, since it involves hardware design and is expensive. The proposed solution in this paper involves low-cost Hardware-in-the-Loop for the Real Time Simulation of the plant or process to be controlled, a PC acting as a controller and a supervisor, and communications via Ethernet between the elements. It has the following advantages: new processes can be controlled by the PC without having to change the topology of the system; modifications on the plant or controller only require software changes; and has the potential of being extensible to a real system if the simulator software is changed to work as an Ethernet to analog decoder/transducer. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Although there are a large number of autonomous robot platforms for ground contact and flying robots, this has not been the case for underwater robotic platforms. This is not due to the lack of interesting applications in the shallow underwater domain (50m depth), but rather due to the relative cost of building such platforms. This has recently changed with the development of inexpensive thrusters and other underwater components. Leveraging these components and design principles learned from more expensive remotely operated vehicles this paper describes Milton, an inexpensive open hardware design for a traditional thruster-based underwater robot.

abstract={The Indian 'smart cities' have burgeoning population consuming the intelligent systems running over the city infrastructure and services. One critical set of such services is that of the emergency services involving Ambulances, Police and Firefighters. The services provided by these officials are often time critical, which makes their easy and quick availability a must have attribute. This paper proposes a solution to make such services available to those in need ensuring minimum response time. The proposed solution is based on capturing live location of the emergency services. This will enable the citizen in need to connect to the nearest available officials. The primary contribution of this paper is that it provides a scalable solution that can be extrapolated to entire city where the number of users using this system will be in millions. Every emergency service official will have an internet and Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled device (Smartphone or low cost hardware module) that will keep streaming live location data to servers. User when in need can get contact details of the nearest available official, which will minimize time involved in the official reaching the user. Security of the location data also has been handled in the proposed solution. The existing location tracking systems will not be able to handle the tremendous data traffic coming from entire city population. This paper proposes a back-end architecture that will be future ready to handle such huge number of users. © 2017 IEEE.},

The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The widespread use of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver in mobile devices induces the adoption of effective GNSS-based indoor positioning algorithms exploiting low-cost hardware. In a previous study, we proposed a new architecture for indoor positioning system to estimate the user position by utilizing the pseudoranges from the smartphone-embedded GNSS module. The advantages of such a system are low cost and low requirements in terms of hardware-level modification for end users. However, all end users and most application developers do not have permission to read the pseudoranges from the embedded GNSS modules. Instead of pseudoranges, the user positions are easily obtained from the GNSS module in any mobile device. Thus, we further improve our positioning algorithm based on the position obtained from the embedded GNSS module rather than the pseudoranges. This position does not correspond to the true one since the indoor signal is non-line-of-sight. Thus, it is named the pseudo-position. The key to the improved algorithm is that the distances from the user terminal to the indoor transmitting antennas are calculated using the differences between the position of the outside antenna and the pseudo-position. The algorithm is tested using a simulated GNSS-based indoor positioning system which is implemented on a GNSS software receiver. The simulation results show that the indoor positioning system is able to provide horizontal positioning with meter-level accuracy in both static and dynamic situations. Additionally, the proposed method improves the robustness of the indoor positioning system to the non-synchronization measurements. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Coxiella burnetii, the causative pathogen for Q fever, is an obligate intracellular bacterium and designated as a biosafety level 3 agent. Detection and quantification of the bacteria with conventional culturing methods is time-consuming and poses significant health risks. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have been developed for detecting C. burnetii and could provide rapid diagnosis. However, they require specialized equipment, including a cold chain for PCR reagents that maintains their stability during storage and transport. These requirements limit the advantage of PCR-based methods, especially in resource-limited areas. Previously, we had developed a lyophilized loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect the presence of C. burnetii. To simplify and improve this assay, the reagents for the LAMP assay and the detecting reagent, SYBR green, were lyophilized together. The stability of the lyophilized reagents was evaluated by measuring changes in detection limit for plasmid DNA encoding a C. burnetii gene upon storage at 4 °C, 25 °C, or 37 °C. Our data indicate that the lyophilized reagents remain stable for 24 months when stored at 4 °C, 28 days at 25 °C, and 2 days at 37 °C. This improved LAMP assay can be easily performed in a simple water bath or heating block.

abstract={A programmable optical stimulator for Drosophila eyes is presented. The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 °C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors’ response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Nailfold capillaroscopy is a valuable yet simple tool to assess microcirculation of blood capillaries. This technique is important in detecting early occurrences of scleroderma spectrum disorders and evaluating Raynaud's Phenomenon. Here it is used in detecting hypertension in patients. Current methods in Nailfold Capillaroscopy involve processing of high resolution images acquired using a commercial capillaroscope whilst the analysis of low resolution images acquired using a low cost hardware is a challenging task. In this paper we preprocess the low resolution capillary images and use Discrete Wavelet Transform for feature extraction.

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach based on pulse transit time (PTT) for the estimation of blood pressure (BP). In order to achieve this goal, a data acquisition hardware is designed for high-resolution sampling of phonocardiogram (PCG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). These two signals can derive PTT values. Meanwhile, a force-sensing resistor (FSR) is placed under the cuff of the BP reference device to mark the moments of measurements accurately via recording instantaneous cuff pressure. For deriving the PTT-BP models, a calibration procedure including a supervised physical exercise is conducted for each individual. The proposed method is evaluated on 24 subjects. The final results prove that using PCG for PTT measurement alongside the proposed models, the BP can be estimated reliably. Since the use of PCG requires a minimal low-cost hardware, the proposed method enables ubiquitous BP estimation in portable healthcare devices. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disorder that is particularly lethal in early childhood. Universal newborn screening programs and subsequent early treatment are known to drastically reduce under-five SCA mortality. However, in resource-limited settings, cost and infrastructure constraints limit the effectiveness of laboratory-based SCA screening programs. To address this limitation our laboratory previously developed a low-cost, equipment-free, point-of-care, paper-based SCA test. Here, we improved the stability and performance of the test by replacing sodium hydrosulfite (HS), a key reducing agent in the hemoglobin solubility buffer which is not stable in aqueous solutions, with sodium metabisulfite (MS). The MS formulation of the test was compared to the HS formulation in a laboratory setting by inexperienced users (n = 3), to determine visual limit of detection (LOD), readout time, diagnostic accuracy, intra- and inter-observer agreement, and shelf life. The MS test was found to have a 10% sickle hemoglobin LOD, 21-min readout time, 97.3% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity for SCA, almost perfect intra- and inter-observer agreement, at least 24 weeks of shelf stability at room temperature, and could be packaged into a self-contained, distributable test kits comprised of off-the-shelf disposable components and food-grade reagents with a total cost of only $0.21 (USD). © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={As the open source development of additive manufacturing has led to low-cost desktop three-dimensional (3-D) printing, a number of scientists throughout the world have begun to share digital designs of free and open source scientific hardware. Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20° platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US $ 37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities.

abstract={Low-cost hardware platforms for biomedical engineering are becoming increasingly available, which empower the research community in the development of new projects in a wide range of areas related with physiological data acquisition. Building upon previous work by our group, this work compares the quality of the data acquired by means of two different versions of the multimodal physiological computing platform BITalino, with a device that can be considered a reference. We acquired data from 5 sensors, namely Accelerometry (ACC), Electrocardiography (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Electromyography (EMG). Experimental evaluation shows that ACC, ECG and EDA data are highly correlated with the reference in what concerns the raw waveforms. When compared by means of their commonly used features, EEG and EMG data are also quite similar across the different devices. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Drowsy driving is the primary cause of motor vehicle accidents and is a risk factor that leads to the loss of human life, remaining as a challenge for the global automotive industry. Recently, drowsy monitoring system has been actively studied for prediction system based machine learning. However, the challenges of automotive real-time constraints and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from vehicle network and other device. To solve this problem, we propose drowsy monitoring system based machine learning using GS1 standard. First, vehicle motion data is defined and modeled using the GS1 standard language for drowsy predict. Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine learning algorithms (KNN, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide integration and implementation through the open source hardware Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework. We provide optimal LSTM architecture and implementation that takes into account the real-time environmental conditions and how to improve the readability and usability of the vehicle motion data. We also share the rapid prototyping methodology case of connected car systems without other sensor devices. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a data acquisition unit which synchronously samples multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i.e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated. Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid integration with popular numerical simulation environments. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In multicore real-time systems, cache partitioning is commonly used to achieve isolation among different cores. We show, however, that space isolation achieved by cache partitioning does not necessarily guarantee predictable cache access timing in modern COTS multicore platforms, which use non-blocking caches. We find that special hardware registers in non-blocking caches, known as miss status holding registers, which track the status of outstanding cache-misses, can be a significant source of contention that is not addressed by conventional cache partitioning. We propose a hardware and system software (OS) collaborative approach to efficiently eliminate MSHR contention for multicore real-time systems. Our approach includes a low-cost hardware extension that enables dynamic control of per-core memory-level parallelism (MLP) by the OS. Using the hardware extension, the OS scheduler then globally controls each core’s MLP in such a way that eliminates MSHR contention and maximizes overall throughput of the system. We implement the hardware extension in a cycle-accurate full-system simulator and the scheduler modification in Linux 3.14 kernel. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significance of the MSHR contention problem and the effectiveness of the proposed solution. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This study analyzes a low-cost reliable real-time optical monitoring platform for fused filament fabrication-based open source 3D printing. An algorithm for reconstructing 3D images from overlapping 2D intensity measurements with relaxed camera positioning requirements is compared with a single-camera solution for single-side 3D printing monitoring. The algorithms are tested for different 3D object geometries and filament colors. The results showed that both of the algorithms with a single- and double-camera system were effective at detecting a clogged nozzle, incomplete project, or loss of filament for a wide range of 3D object geometries and filament colors. The combined approach was the most effective and achieves 100% detection rate for failures. The combined method analyzed here has a better detection rate and a lower cost compared to previous methods. In addition, this method is generalizable to a wide range of 3D printer geometries, which enables further deployment of desktop 3D printing as wasted print time and filament are reduced, thereby improving the economic advantages of distributed manufacturing. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={The majority of approaches for rotationally aligning panoramic images use feature-based methods which extract and match visual clues in both images and analytically determine their rotational offset. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and might suffer from motion blur or images taken in structureless environments (e.g. forests). An alternative approach is the visual compass, a method which simulates a wide range of possible rotational offsets and searches for the best match. While this approach has been successfully implemented for rotations around a single axis, the increasing computation time for 3D rotations limits the usability for real-time applications. It has been suggested to use real spherical harmonics (RSH) to represent panoramic images, to calculate rotations in frequency domain using sparse matrix-vector multiplications. In this paper, we present strategies which are crucial to implement a real-time visual 3D compass using RSH. We provide a software implementation of the visual 3D compass and analyze the effect of increasing rotational misalignment between pairs of panoramic images. Furthermore, we show that the visual 3D compass can be used on low-cost hardware in real-time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Bangladesh faces daunting challenges in addressing the sanitation needs of its urban poor. Maintaining the cleanliness and functionality of communal toilets is dependent upon periodic emptying of fecal sludge, and cooperation between users of communal toilets. Trash disposal into latrines can block the outflow pipes, rendering the toilets non-functional. Methods: Pre-intervention: We conducted in-depth interviews with five operators of fecal sludge emptying equipment and five adult residents who were also caregivers of children. We identified factors contributing to improper disposal of trash into communal toilets, a barrier to operation of the equipment, in low-income communities of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Intervention design: We developed behavior change communication materials to discourage waste disposal in toilets, and promote use of waste bins. We conducted six focus group discussions with adult male, female, landlord and children to select the preferred design for waste bins to be placed inside toilets, and finalize communication materials. Post-intervention: We then pilot-tested an intervention package to promote appropriate trash disposal practices and thus facilitate periodic removal of fecal sludge when the latrine pits become full. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions with community residents, landlords and cleaners of communal toilets. Results: Barriers to appropriate waste disposal included lack of private location for disposal of menstrual hygiene products, limited options for formal trash collection and disposal, and the use of plastic bags for disposing children's feces. A pilot intervention including behavior change communication and trash bins was implemented in two urban slum communities. Spot checks confirmed that the bins were in place and used. Respondents described positive improvements in the appearance of the toilet and surrounding environment. Conclusion: The current practice on the part of local residents of disposing of waste into toilets impedes the safe removal of fecal sludge and impairs toilet functionality. Residents reported positive changes in toilet cleanliness and usability resulting from this intervention, and this both improves the user experience with toilets, and also promotes the sustainability of the entrepreneurial model of Vacutug operators supported by WSUP. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The primary objective of the paper is to construct and test a low-cost, minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static gestures efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335 accelerometer sensors which track the gestures and these sensors are interfaced with an Arduino ATMega 2560 micro-controller for data processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible algorithm which requires only nominal resources to recognize the gestures. The paper further elucidates on minimizing the number of accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption of the system. The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained from 3 trained ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the proposed system with a maximum and minimum configuration of 5 and 2 accelerometers was found to be 95.3% and 87.0%, with the cost of these prototype systems being realized at 20 USD and 12.5 USD respectively. It was also found that the system can be trained for the static gestures of the alphabets in ASL under two minutes by a new-user with any system configuration. The authors also feel that the system is compatible with other IoT platforms for interoperability. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional outdoor positioning systems such as GPS, fails to locate indoor places and thus Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) have a lot of importance. These systems are integral in providing Location Based Services (LBS) which can ease the daily life with useful information about one's current surroundings. Local network infrastructure such as Wi-Fi which is already available in places such as hospitals, shopping malls and educational institutions, can be used to locate a place in the indoor environment using the properties of the Wi-Fi signal. Hence we propose a model for indoor positioning system which implements a trilateration method using the amount of signal loss of at least three Access Points (AP) to find the position of a target. Also, we use techniques to stabilize the signal collection and compare the data with historical data to provide considerably accurate positional information. This system consists of very few components and the deployment criteria are comparatively simpler, so it can be easily deployed. Also, the use of low cost equipment such as Wi-Fi routers makes sure that the system is economically feasible. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Tangible learning is a promising branch, especially for scientific learning, allowing an enhanced sensorial involvement and participation by children. While a lot is being done on the side of programming, less has been investigated on elementary spatial and geometric concepts. The paper presents i-Vertex, an open-hardware framework for tangible serious games on geometry concepts for primary school pupils. The framework targets spatial reasoning and includes music as a related and complementary feature, which should add value also for usability. i-Vertex supports collaboration between kids and the key role of a teacher as an adult that interacts with the children in different ways, introducing them to the discovery and understanding of basic geometric concepts and physical phenomenon. At present, we have built a prototype, featuring a very limited number of vertices, and functionally tested it in lab, in two main scenarios covering topics such as lines and triangles. Based on the successful feedback of this experiment, we intend to proceed further, upgrading the platform with a more powerful and product oriented micro-controller and board. © 2017 IEEE.},

Through a central command unit, it is possible to configure timers to turn on and off all devices connected to the network. The system also adds intelligence to conventional equipment by making use of a motion sensor, avoiding electricity waste. An automatic temperature control is implemented through sensors that monitor external conditions.

abstract={Massive multiple-input-multiple-output full-duplex relaying (MM-FDR), which exploits both the benefits of large-scale antenna arrays and full-duplex transmission, is considered as a promising technology to achieve very high spectral efficiency in the future wireless network. Despite the inevitable presence of transceiver impairments due to the use of low-cost hardware components, most of the prior works on MM-FDR assume perfect transceiver hardware which is unrealistic in practice. This paper investigates the impact of hardware impairments on the MM-FDR. Based on the recent experimental results, the effect of hardware impairments is modeled using transmit and receive distortion noises. The end-to-end achievable rate is derived and the scaling behaviors of echo interference due to the full-duplex operation, multi-user interference and effective distortions caused by hardware impairments are obtained. The scaling results show that the achievable rate of MM-FDR is limited by the hardware impairments at the sources and destinations, instead of that at the relay or other interferences, as the number of relay antenna tends to infinity. A low-complexity power control scheme is proposed to further improve the energy efficiency of MM-FDR with hardware impairments. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the spectral-energy efficiency tradeoff significantly. © 2011 KICS.},

abstract={Open Source Hardware allows users to share, customize, and improve designs, thus enabling technological advancement through communities of practice. We propose open source hardware for educational haptics that permits researchers, educators, and students to share designs arising from their different perspectives, with the potential to expand educational applications. In this paper we present a family of open source kinesthetic haptic devices that build upon the design of a previous educational haptic device, Hapkit 3.0. First, we discuss methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit 3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small number of additional parts to transform them into a two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering and nonengineering students. Open source designs for all devices as well as tutorials for customization are available at http://hapkit.stanford.edu. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Implementing high-performance, low-cost hardware accelerators for the computationally intensive image and video processing algorithms has attracted a lot of attention in the last 20 years. Most of the recent research efforts were trying to figure out new design automation methods to fill the gap between the ability of realizing efficient accelerators in hardware and the tight performance requirements of the complex image processing algorithms. High-Level synthesis (HLS) is a new method to automate the design process by transforming high-level algorithmic description into digital hardware while satisfying the design constraints. This chapter focuses on evaluating the suitability of using HLS as a new tool to accelerate the most demanding image and video processing algorithms in hardware. It discusses the gained benefits and current limitations, the recent academic and commercial tools, the compiler's optimization techniques and four case studies. © 2018 IGI Global.

abstract={Taking design inspiration from biological creatures can enable inheriting functional aspects such as locomotion of the target creatures in their robotic counterparts. Bio-inspired robots are particularly useful in dealing with applications involving surveillance, reconnaissance, and environment monitoring. Non-availability of inexpensive robotic platforms causes a barrier in the advancement of this field. This paper reports an open source alligator-inspired quadruped robotic platform which is easy and fast to prototype, open to design iterations and affordable. The reported approach utilizes laser cutting based fabrication and thereby reduces the development time drastically. The main features of the reported open source hardware system comprise of fabrication and assembly plan in the form of dxf files, embedded electrical circuits in the form of circuit diagrams and PCB layouts, and a locomotion control system in the form of software. We believe that such an open source design can accelerate research and development activities in the area of bio-inspired design as the researchers can improvise upon the open source model rather than starting from scratch. © 2016 IEEE.},

The used model is evaluated on ramp-up simulation in Simulink, and after that mathematical equations are implemented in Modelica language and exported into Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU). The controlled and control models are both simulated on Raspberry Pi minicomputers in real-time and one can observe the control strategy on the second Raspberry with prepared control task and Human Machine Interface (HMI). Both Raspberries are connected through the Modbus over TCP/IP protocol and one can get familiar with this wide-used communication. Furthermore, there is possibility to control the system, change regulators parameters and handle the trade-off between various performances. Regulation can be operated in so-called island or grid mode. The aim of system control is to comply shaft speed demands described in norms. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The chip industry faces two key challenges today -The impending end of Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and domain-specific accelerators -Are a promising answer to the first challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-And-play designs can help with the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-And-play SoC environment is an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area -And yet be flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency increases proportional to the number of hops. In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART1. SMART is a recently proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multihop on-chip traversals within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs, enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of userspecified network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on. OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today. OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download2 and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging IPs. © 2017 IEEE.},

For hardware development, the Bottom Up methodology was used, and Kanban methodology was used for the software. The cost of the proposed system is on average 10% that of commercial electronic devices used in the industry to solve process automation problems.

abstract={As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can consume a large percentage of the energy used in a typical building. Intelligent building automation systems (BAS) are widely deployed to enable more efficient HVAC utilization, thus reducing the energy consumed. Enhanced data requires distributed sensing. We propose an instrumentation system for a low-cost, over-the-top efficiency monitor using the open-source hardware design to enable rapid deployment and live monitoring of temperature within zones such as rooms. This enables evaluation of HVAC system efficiency, and building parameter monitoring in that room. This paper presents our HVAC, thermal, and building parameter monitoring system design and considerations using an open-source hardware approach for fast customizations. We show results of monitoring two buildings including distributed sensing within rooms, and discuss intelligence gathered through use of this system as a precursor towards a fully automated efficiency evaluation and measurement. © 2017 IEEE.},

Millions of free and open source designs are now available on the Internet, and as this article shows using life-cycle analysis, prosumers can radically reduce both the economic costs of goods and the environmental impact as compared to conventionally manufactured goods by utilizing the most aggressive form of distributed manufacturing: making the products they need at home using digital designs created from what would otherwise be their waste. Finally, some of the most likely future technical developments will be reviewed to provide guidance into the potential for distributed manufacturing in the future and the subsequent effect on the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Most initiatives about embedded sensing capabilities in computational systems lead to devise an ad hoc sensor platform, usually poorly reusable, as a first stage to prepare a data corpus or production prototype. In this paper, an open source hardware platform for sensing is described. This platform was intended to be used in data acquisition for gait identification, and is designed in a way general enough so many other projects could reuse the design to accelerate prototyping. The platform is based on popular open source hardware and software like Arduino and Raspberry Pi using well known languages and libraries. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of the development of a modular open source platform for experimental control setups. This platform emerged from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the form of a modular platform for real-time control. The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing, observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost hardware and free software especially suited for flight control experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware developers and control engineers. © 2017},

abstract={We describe the implementation of an OPT plate to perform optical projection tomography (OPT) on a commercial wide-field inverted microscope, using our open-source hardware and software. The OPT plate includes a tilt adjustment for alignment and a stepper motor for sample rotation as required by standard projection tomography. Depending on magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed at magnifications ≥4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to ∼1.6 μm). All three methods use the microscope's existing incoherent light source (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for day-to-day use. OPT acquisitions are performed on in vivo zebrafish embryos to demonstrate the implementations' viability. © 2017 Watson et al.

abstract={In engineering, traditional approaches aimed at teaching concepts of dynamics to engineering students include the study of a dense yet sequential theoretical development of proofs and exercises. Structural dynamics are seldom taught experimentally in laboratories since these facilities should be provided with expensive equipment such as wave generators, data-acquisition systems, and heavily wired deployments with sensors. In this paper, the design of an experimental experience in the classroom based upon digital fabrication and modeling tools related to structural dynamics is presented. In particular, all experimental deployments are conceived with low-cost, open-source equipment. The hardware includes Arduino-based open-source electronics whereas the software is based upon object-oriented open-source codes for the development of physical simulations. The set of experiments and the physical simulations are reproducible and scalable in classroom-based environments. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Currently, more and more organizations are aware of the increasing potential of nanoscience and nanotechnology, due to the wide field of innovative applications they address from biomedical and molecular technology to semiconductor and material sciences. Nanotechnology is an area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones, cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanœye project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics, software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first functional structure of Nanœye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic Control Demonstrators. © 2017},

abstract={Model predictive control applications have broadened from industrial plants with slow system dynamics to the implementation of control algorithms on low-cost hardware. Ip2go has been developed with the aim of making model predictive control readily accessible on embedded systems. It generates efficient, problem-tailored solvers for optimal control problems. The code generator implements Mehrotra's predictor-corrector interior-point method with Riccati recursions. It can be applied to quadratic programming problems with linear discrete-time system dynamics and polytopic inequality constraints. Both hard and soft constraints can be implemented. In this paper the features of ip2go, the underlying algorithm, the benefits of code generation and the generation process are set out. The comparison of ip2go-generated solvers to state-of-the-art solvers shows that ip2go can compete in terms of efficiency and code-size. The open and modular design allows all users to amend the generator. The Matlab and based and LGPL licensed C-code generator ip2go is available under https://github.com/fabiankrank/ip2go. © 2017},

abstract={Since 2001, the departments of Electrical and Electronics and Information and Communication Electronics Engineering of Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) have jointly given a lecture on autonomous electronic information devices for undergraduate students. According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called 'the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an 'input', 'output', and some 'information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their 'methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking introduced by René Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement, open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future directions.},

In this way, a low cost hardware with moderate instantaneous RF bandwidth can be used. The total time for hopping all the frequencies, i.e. the data collection time, is also reduced.

abstract={The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high. Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this investigation, a neuro-Adaptive control scheme where the rule for parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control system for brushless synchronous servomotors. The experimental tests have been carried on using compact and flexible, based on open hardware and software concept, dual-Axis motion controllers PMC201/PMC202 manufactured by the PicoMotion Inc. The applied software has been written using the Motion Control Framework software platform, provided together with the above controllers. The results obtained with the proposed neuro-Adaptive control scheme have been compared to those obtained using the originally built into the system PI controller. The experiments have shown that the implemented advanced adaptive control approach is practically viable and can be embedded into the industrial motion control systems which will lead to their improved performance. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a light-weight rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on off-the-shelf open source hardware to achieve high performance computing, cost effectiveness, portability, and easy accessiblity. The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={An open hardware framework for approximating range and bearing of radio frequency (RF) sensors is presented. The current work has an immediate application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360° has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing. The proposed hardware setup is validated through a set of experimental results gathered in an indoor environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We present an observational study of physical prototype critique that highlights some of the challenges of communicating physical behaviors and materiality at a distance. Geographically distributed open hardware communities often conduct user feedback and peer critique sessions via video conference. However, people have difficulty using current video conferencing tools to demonstrate and critique physical designs. To examine the challenges of remote critique, we conducted an observational lab study in which participants critiqued pairs of physical prototypes (prosthetic hands) for a face-to-face or remote collaborator. In both conditions, participants' material experiences were an important part of their critique, however their attention was divided between interacting with the prototype and finding strategies to communicate 'invisible' features. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for remote collaboration tools that support the sharing of material experiences and prototype critique.

abstract={Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are increasingly gaining interest as a source of renewable energy. These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary. © 2017 by the authors.

In this paper, a customizable hardware based uP simulator is presented and final proposed. Using this simulator, an experimental hypothetical educational uP can be built by students and the professors can create the corresponding learning scenarios.

abstract={Identification of hydrodynamic coefficients and accessibility of accurate mathematical model to predict actual responses of vessels has practical significance to design computer-based simulators and apply new control algorithms, thus effective methods and proper devices should be investigated to do the modelling. The aim of this study was to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients of a surface vessel from the free running test using an experimental modelling method. Working as the embedded platform and data acquisition card, myRIO was utilized to control the scaled model, namely 'P&O Nedlloyd Hoorn', and measure her motion states using low cost sensors including a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, accelerometer, gyroscope and digital compass. System identification was conducted utilizing the processed experimental data with Kalman filter to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a mathematical model in four degree of freedom (DOF) including surge, sway, yaw and roll. The developed mathematical model of the scaled model was validated through the comparison between the experimental data and simulation results. It has demonstrated that the proposed low cost hardware and system identification algorithm is capable of estimating hydrodynamic coefficients of the proposed mathematical model of the scaled surface vessel. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Multicarrier modulation is one of the cornerstones of modern radio communications. Nowadays Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) finds wide employment in terrestrial mobile standards (WiMax and LTE) and also some significant applications in satellite communications. In order to improve OFDM efficiency and reduce the impact of nonlinear amplification, some variants of OFDM have been recently proposed; the most important are: Single-Carrier OFDM (SC-OFDM), known also as Discrete-Fourier Transform (DFT)-precoded OFDM recently proposed for Digital Video Broadcasting Next Generation broadcasting system to Handheld (DVB-NGH) standard, and the multi-user version of SC-OFDM, known as Single-Carrier Frequency-Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA), adopted by LTE for the uplink transmissions. In our paper, we aim at proposing a novel reconfigurable multicarrier transceiver implementation based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR), where OFDM and SC-OFDM TX/RX modes can coexist in the same device. The core module of the transceiver is based on the conventional OFDM, implemented in the digital domain by means of the N-point inverse Fast Fourier Transform (I-FFT). SC-OFDM precoding, performed by means of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) applied to a subset of M information symbols, is instantiated before I-FFT, when SC-OFDM mode is required. The SDR transceiver modules have been implemented by using open source GNU Radio tools and tested in open field by means of low cost hardware devices for RF transmission of software-generated basedband signals. Experimental trials have evidenced the viability of proposed SDR implementation, together with the recognized advantages that SC-OFDM offers in terms of improved link performance in hostile propagation environment. However, it has also been noticed that such improvement is obtained at the expense of a considerable increase of the computaional burden at the receiver side, if compared to that of regular OFDM. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Continuous monitoring for damage detection in structural assessment comprises implementation of low cost equipment and efficient algorithms. This work describes the stages involved in the design of a methodology with high feasibility to be used in continuous damage assessment. Specifically, an algorithm based on a data-driven approach by using principal component analysis and pre-processing acquired signals by means of cross-correlation functions, is discussed. A carbon steel pipe section and a laboratory tower were used as test structures in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology to detect abrupt changes in the structural response when damages occur. Two types of damage cases are studied: crack and leak for each structure, respectively. Experimental results show that the methodology is promising in the continuous monitoring of real structures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Memory stalls are a significant source of performance degradation in modern processors. Data prefetching is a widely adopted and well studied technique used to alleviate this problem. Prefetching can be performed by the hardware, or be initiated and controlled by software. Among software controlled prefetching we find a wide variety of schemes, including runtime-directed prefetching and more specifically runtime-directed block prefetching. This paper proposes a hybrid prefetching mechanism that integrates a software driven block prefetcher with existing hardware prefetching techniques. Our runtime-assisted software prefetcher brings large blocks of data on-chip with the support of a low cost hardware engine, and synergizes with existing hardware prefetchers that manage locality at a finer granularity. The runtime system that drives the prefetch engine dynamically selects which cache to prefetch to. Our evaluation on a set of scientific benchmarks obtains a maximum speed up of 32 and 10 % on average compared to a baseline with hardware prefetching only. As a result, we also achieve a reduction of up to 18 and 3 % on average in energy-to-solution. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={We are developing room temperature electronics based upon the ROACH platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in the FPGA by storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Biochips, or digital labs-on-chip, are developed with the purpose of being used by laboratory technicians or biologists in laboratories or clinics. In this article, we expand this vision with the goal of enabling everyone, regardless of their expertise, to use biochips for their own personal purposes. We developed OPENDROP, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OPENDROP consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OPENDROP, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47% of attempts to replicate OPENDROP were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications. Our work provides a step towards a future in which everyone will be able to create microfluidic devices for their personal applications, thereby democratizing parts of health care. © 2017 by the authors.

In MTC, devices may use low-cost hardware-based random number generators for pseudo-random noise (PN) sequences in secure communications. Since PN sequences can be estimated by correlation attacks at an eavesdropper, induced random (chip) flipping of spreading sequences is proposed to make correlation attacks infeasible. However, induced random flipping can also degrade the performance of detection and decoding at a legitimate receiver that only knows original spreading sequences. To avoid the performance degradation, we derive low-complexity iterative receiver algorithms for multiuser signal detection and decoding based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={While model predictive control (MPC) is the industrially preferred method for advanced control in the process industries, it has not found much use in consumer products and safety-critical embedded systems applications in industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical, and robotics. The main barriers are implementability and dependability, where important factors are implementation of advanced numerical optimization algorithms on resource-limited embedded computing platforms and the associated complexity of verification. This challenge comes from a requirement of the use of ultrareliable hardware and software architectures in safety-critical applications, low-cost hardware in consumer products, or both. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the emerging field of dependable embedded MPC, and discusses some key challenges related to its design, implementation, and verification. A novel result is the study of a simulator-based performance monitoring and control selection method that monitors and predicts MPC performance and switches to a highly reliable backup controller in cases when the MPC experiences performance issues. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)–a common model species in ecotoxicology—to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water. © 2017 Steffens et al.

abstract={This paper elucidates the design and implementation of a low-cost wireless intelligent two hand gesture recognition system. The proposed system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328 microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency was found to be 80.06% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16% in EIM. The cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization. © 2017 IEEE.},

Remotely controlled lab provides training skills in bio-inspired robotics. Our previous studies had shown that the implementation of remotely controlled online labs in the curriculum improved active learning among students, collaboration, and augmented problem solving skills. The preliminary implementation involved proprietary software, as the remote experiment accessibility platform, which was later replaced with FOSS technology. The advantages with FOSS included a significantly lower cost and scalability for concurrent usage. The paper also reports on usage analysis and common issues in both cases of implementations. © 2016 IEEE.},

Existing literature in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape detail opportunities and difficulties, but performance data to evaluate the overheads and suitability of services provisioning for industrial applications is not readily available. So, we designed and developed a General Telematic Framework for Rapid Application Development using Service-Oriented Architectural (SOA) principles and then provisioned services used in typical CPSS environments on embedded Raspberry Pi hardware modules. Performance profiling demonstrates the suitability for Industry-grade CPSS applications. Other applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle search and rescue, Vehicular Tracking, and distributed management systems are also possible with OSGi-based, embedded telematics system. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: The advantages of 3D reconstruction, immersive virtual reality (VR) and 3D printing in abdominal surgery have been enunciated for many years, but still today their application in routine clinical practice is almost nil. We investigate their feasibility, user appreciation and clinical impact. Material and methods: Fifteen patients undergoing pancreatic, hepatic or renal surgery were studied realizing a 3D reconstruction of target anatomy. Then, an immersive VR environment was developed to import 3D models, and some details of the 3D scene were printed. All the phases of our workflow employed open-source software and low-cost hardware, easily implementable by other surgical services. A qualitative evaluation of the three approaches was performed by 20 surgeons, who filled in a specific questionnaire regarding a clinical case for each organ considered. Results: Preoperative surgical planning and intraoperative guidance was feasible for all patients included in the study. The vast majority of surgeons interviewed scored their quality and usefulness as very good. Conclusions: Despite extra time, costs and efforts necessary to implement these systems, the benefits shown by the analysis of questionnaires recommend to invest more resources to train physicians to adopt these technologies routinely, even if further and larger studies are still mandatory. © 2017 SMIT - Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy.},

abstract={Vehicular ad-hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging mobile wireless ad hoc communication system applied on the roads, realizing multi-hop wireless communication between Vehicles to Vehicles, Vehicles to Roadside Infrastructure (RSI) and between RSIs. The Vehicle transmits the information to the nearest RSI that is connected to gateway either wirelessly or wired. The deployment of a roadside infrastructure is expensive and cannot be efficiently implemented using low-cost hardware. Power Line Communication (PLC) refers to the utilization of electricity transmission power lines for communication medium whilst simultaneously serving as a physical medium for realization of data transmission. PLC today are not only used for remote meter reading, home automation and other low-speed control systems but are also utilized at physical layer of Internet infrastructure. The power line is the only network that is available almost in any part of the inhabited area, hence can provide extensive coverage for VANET. In this article a scheme is proposed for power lines serve as a medium for transfer of information from RSI to RSI and RSI to Internet gateway. Standard equations are used to noise analysis and quantify the proposed approach as a cost effective deployment of PLC for VANET. Simulation results are provided for further investigations and research. It is evident that PLC with low data rate is suitable for transmission of smart car sensor data as compare to costly high-speed wireless medium. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University. © 2017 IEEE.},

We examine the factors promoting the successful uptake of a maker platform from two perspectives: first, we investigate the technical and user experience considerations that users identify as the most important. Second, we explore the specific activities that help attract a community and encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on the relationship between the platform and the community and offer suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in establishing their own maker communities.

abstract={Traffic congestion is not only a cause of nuisance for general commuters but also a factor that has a measurable impact on the economy if not handled proactively. When congestion increases, the waiting time for commuters increases which results in wasted fuel and wasted time. Wasted fuel adds to the import bill of a country and lost time results in loss of productivity. Traffic can be regulated at various points in order to reduce congestion and eliminate bottleneck areas. In this paper, we propose the use of conventional scheduling to regulate traffic at intersections in order to reduce congestion. We propose minimum destination distance first (MDDF) and minimum average destination distance first (MADDF) algorithms and compare them with some of the relevant existing scheduling algorithms. The proposed algorithms can not only be easily implemented on low cost hardware but also show better performance and outperform the existing algorithms that are considered, based on simulation results. Simulation results show that the MDDF and MADDF algorithms reduce the traffic congestion at intersections by up to 80% in some cases compared to static traffic lights. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that has been accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware. © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

abstract={This paper proposes and investigates a multilevel ac six-phase motor drive. The system is composed of five isolated three-leg voltage source inverters feeding the open-end windings of an asymmetrical six-phase induction motor (SPIM), which is adequate to generate multilevel voltages for high-power systems with voltage rating restrictions. A simple space vector pulse-width modulation (PWM) based on three similar individual planes and its implementation by means of equivalent level-shifted PWM are presented. A space vector pattern with a high number of voltage vectors redundancies is obtained. These redundancies and the application sequence of the voltage vectors are selected to minimize the amount of changes in the switching states and to decrease the harmonic distortion of the generated voltages. The vector pattern of this optimal modulation is obtained by analyzing only one plane and applied in the same way to the three planes as if they were independent. The developed PWM techniques have low computational complexity and are suitable for low-cost hardware implementations. Simulation results are used to compare the proposed topology with a conventional configuration in terms of harmonic distortion and semiconductor losses. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed drive system. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective Training for the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) skills test can be expensive. Previous work demonstrated that training on an ergonomically different, low-cost platform does not affect FLS skills test outcomes. This study compares the average training cost with standard FLS equipment and medical-grade consumables versus training on a lower cost platform with non–medical-grade consumables. Design Subjects were prospectively randomized to either the standard FLS training platform (n = 19) with medical-grade consumables (S-FLS), or the low-cost platform (n = 20) with training-grade products (LC-FLS). Both groups trained to proficiency using previously established mastery learning standards on the 5 FLS tasks. The fixed and consumable cost differences were compared. Setting Training occurred in a surgical simulation center. Participants Laparoscopic novice medical student and resident physician health care professionals who had not completed the national FLS proficiency curriculum and who had performed less than 10 laparoscopic cases. Results The fixed cost of the platform was considerably higher in the S-FLS group (S-FLS, $3360; LC-FLS, $879), and the average consumable training cost was significantly higher for the S-FLS group (S-FLS, $1384.52; LC-FLS, $153.79; p < 0.001). The LC-FLS group had a statistically discernable cost reduction for each consumable (Gauze $9.24 vs. $0.39, p = 0.002; EndoLoop $540.00 vs. $40.60, p < 0.001; extracorporeal suture $216.45 vs. $25.20, p < 0.001; intracorporeal suture $618.83 vs. $87.60, p < 0.001). The annual fixed and consumable cost to train 5 residents is $10,282.60 in the S-FLS group versus $1647.95 in the LC-FLS group. Conclusions This study shows that the average cost to train a single trainee to proficiency using a lower fixed-cost platform and non–medical-grade equipment results in significant financial savings. A 5-resident program will save approximately $8500 annually. Residency programs should consider adopting this strategy to reduce the cost of FLS training. © 2017},

abstract={Monitoring the integrity of structures and machines is an evergrowing concern in engineering applications. Better knowledge of structural conditions allows optimized maintenance cycles, increasing the availability and return of investment, and preventing failure of various systems from manufacturing equipment to air and land vehicles. A common way of evaluating the integrity of mechanical systems is capturing and analyzing vibration signals during operation. Many of the condition monitoring systems are highly specialized, incurring high initial investment. In this context, the objective of this work is to demonstrate the possibility of using low-cost systems for monitoring the integrity of structures. The use of piezoelectric sensors to capture vibration signals is currently ubiquitous, and acquisition and conditioning of these signals can be performed by low cost and open source logic programmable microcontrollers such as Arduino. Structures coupled to non-ideal motors (such that the phenomenon of resonance capture can occur) are used in this study. Controlled structural modifications are performed by the addition of point masses along the length of the beam, and by the application of magnetomotive forces with the use of an electromagnet at a fixed point on the beam. The experimental data is compared to analytical and numerical results, and to an established commercial system, demonstrating the possibility of satisfactory monitoring of structural integrity with such system. © 2017.

abstract={Isaac Newton famously observed that "if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." We propose that this sentiment is a powerful motivation for the "open-source" movement in scientific research, in which creators provide everything needed to replicate a given project online, as well as providing explicit permission for users to use, improve, and share it with others. Here, we write to introduce analytical chemists who are new to the open-source movement to best practices and concepts in this area and to survey the state of open-source research in analytical chemistry. We conclude by considering two examples of open-source projects from our own research group, with the hope that a description of the process, motivations, and results will provide a convincing argument about the benefits that this movement brings to both creators and users. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Depth information has been used in many fields because of its low cost and easy availability, since the Microsoft Kinect was released. However, the Kinect and Kinect-like RGB-D sensors show limited performance in certain applications and place high demands on accuracy and robustness of depth information. In this paper, we propose a depth sensing system that contains a laser projector similar to that used in the Kinect, and two infrared cameras located on both sides of the laser projector, to obtain higher spatial resolution depth information. We apply the block-matching algorithm to estimate the disparity. To improve the spatial resolution, we reduce the size of matching blocks, but smaller matching blocks generate lower matching precision. To address this problem, we combine two matching modes (binocular mode and monocular mode) in the disparity estimation process. Experimental results show that our method can obtain higher spatial resolution depth without loss of the quality of the range image, compared with the Kinect. Furthermore, our algorithm is implemented on a low-cost hardware platform, and the system can support the resolution of 1280 × 960, and up to a speed of 60 frames per second, for depth image sequences. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={A heuristic predictive line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is introduced to intercept a high-speed maneuvering target. A combination of continuous ant colony system and tabu search optimization algorithms is proposed to generate the optimal predictive commands of LOS guidance law. Prediction is driven by the previous positions of the target to estimate the next positions of it. Thus, the guidance system is continually solving a dynamic optimization problem in order to determine the acceleration commands by minimizing a cost function subject to actuators saturation. This innovation distinguishes the proposed guidance law from the classic LOS guidance, described by a simple relation between the deviation from the LOS and the guidance commands and use only the current measurement. The performance of the proposed guidance law is verified by carrying out several simulations of three dimensional scenarios. By still requiring simple and low-cost hardware in the new guidance law, simulation results show that the proposed heuristic predictive line-of-sight guidance law can prepare comparable performance in the whole case studies which show the robustness and adaptability of the proposed scheme. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain.

abstract={Recent moves by many Great Basin and California scholars to connect the ethnographic record with archaeological evidence have fostered new understandings of the interconnected relationship between landscape, human behavior, and cosmology. Oral tradition and ethnographic commentary reinvigorate rock art research, once emblematic of interpretive impasses. Phenomena described as spirit voices connect multisensory religious experiences associated with such sites distributed throughout the region, and possibly result from rituals inherent in producing and interacting with painted and engraved images. The prolific ‘pecking’ production technique exemplifies actions which would result in both auditory experiences and durable visible traces. Recent fieldwork at a rock art site situated at the juncture of the Great Basin and Mojave Desert tested the propagation of sounds comparable to those generated with this technique. Preliminary results of ongoing analysis, reported here, demonstrate how low-cost equipment and zero-trace methods can be mobilized to generate useful and compelling data for addressing complex sensitive matters of non-western ontologies, all while remaining committed to the framework of the scientific method. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={An open-source 3-D printable laboratory sample rotator mixer is developed here in two variants that allow users to opt for the level of functionality, cost saving and associated complexity needed in their laboratories. First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={One oft-cited strategy towards sustainability is improving energy efficiency inside public buildings. In this context, the educational buildings sector presents a very interesting and important case for the monitoring and management of buildings, since it addresses both energy and educational issues. In this work, we present and discuss the hardware IoT infrastructure substrate that provides real-time monitoring in multiple school buildings. We believe that such a system needs to follow an open design approach: rely on hardware-agnostic components that communicate over well-defined open interfaces. We present in detail the design of our hardware components, while also providing insights to the overall system design and a first set of results on their operation. The presented hardware components are utilized as the core hardware devices for GAIA, an EU research project aimed at the educational community. As our system has been deployed and tested in several public school buildings in Greece, we also report on its validation. © 2017},

abstract={Security against hardware Trojan that is capable to change the computational output value is accomplished by employing dual modular redundant (DMR) schedule during high level synthesis (HLS). However, building a DMR for Trojan security is nontrivial and incurs extra delay and hardware. This paper proposes a novel HLS methodology for constraint driven low cost hardware Trojan secured DMR schedule design for loop-based control data flow graphs (CDFGs). Proposed approach simultaneously explores an optimal schedule and optimal loop unrolling factor (U) combination for a low cost Trojan security aware DMR schedule. As a specific example, proposed low cost Trojan secured HLS approach relies on particle swarm optimization algorithm to explore optimized Trojan secured schedule with optimal unrolling that provides security against specific Trojan (causing change in computational output) within user provided area and delay constraints. The novel contributions of this paper are, first an exploration of a low cost Trojan security aware HLS solution for loop-based CDFGs; second, proposed encoding scheme for representing design solution comprising candidate schedule resources, candidate loop unrolling factor and candidate vendor allocation information; third, a process for exploring the a low cost vendor assignment that provides Trojan security; finally, experimental results over the standard benchmark that indicates an average reduction in final cost of 12% compared to recent approach. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

The proposed design is intrinsically unbalanced and features a very good match to a 50 Ω line at resonance, which makes our device essentially plug'n'play for a coaxial cable feed. Another interesting property of the proposed antenna is its simplicity of construction. The antenna has been modelled using the moment method. A prototype resonant at 2.4 GHz has been built and we have measured its impedance in this spectral region. The radiation pattern and the gain at resonance have also been characterized and the device has been shown to provide 6.31 dBi gain.

abstract={For land vehicle navigation in urban area, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers often suffer from the lack of positioning accuracy, availability, and continuity due to insufficient number of visible satellites and multipath errors. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes an efficient hybrid positioning method combining a single frequency GPS receiver and a monocular vision sensor. The proposed method is advantageous in that it requires only low-cost hardware and no external map aiding. Compared with existing vision-based methods, the proposed method directly measures absolute heading angle based on the images of straight road segments. For the reason, the proposed method is resilient to multipath errors. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the experiments with field-collected real measurements; one with good satellite visibility and the others with poor satellite visibility. Comparison with existing positioning methods demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method in urban area. © 2017, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This platform is specifically designed for solar-powered, low bandwidth, high computational performance wireless sensor network applications. A self-recovering unit is designed to increase reliability and allow periodic hard resets, an essential requirement for sensor networks. A radio monitoring circuitry is proposed to monitor incoming and outgoing transmissions, simplifying software debugging. We illustrate the performance of this wireless sensor platform on complex problems arising in smart cities, such as traffic flow monitoring, machine-learning-based flash flood monitoring or Kalman-filter based vehicle trajectory estimation.

abstract={Recently, there has been growing interest in spatial data that combines information and communication technology with smart cities. The high-precision LiDAR (Light Dectection and Ranging) equipment is mainly used to collect three-dimensional spatial data, and the acquired data is also used to model geographic features and to manage plant construction and cultural heritages which require precision. The LiDAR equipment can collect precise data, but also has limitations because they are expensive and take long time to collect data. On the other hand, in the field of computer vision, research is being conducted on the methods of acquiring image data and performing 3D reconstruction based on image data without expensive equipment. Thus, precise 3D spatial data can be constructed efficiently by collecting and processing image data using CCTVs which are installed as infrastructure facilities in smart cities. However, this method can have an accuracy problem compared to the existing equipment. In this study, experiments were conducted and the results were analyzed to increase the number of extracted matching points by applying the feature-based method and the area-based method in order to improve the precision of 3D spatial data built with image data acquired from stereo CCTVs. For techniques to extract matching points, SIFT algorithm and PATCH algorithm were used. If precise 3D reconstruction is possible using the image data from stereo CCTVs, it will be possible to collect 3D spatial data with low-cost equipment and to collect and build data in real time because image data can be easily acquired through the Web from smart-phones and drones.},

abstract={We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet our understanding and attachment to themis rather limited. One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Much like how mobile phones ceased to be only person-to-person communications devices and became technical platforms, in-vehicle electronic devices will too cease to be solely information devices and become technical platforms incorporating all-encompassing features, including but not limited to ADAS, navigation, communication, and entertainment. This fundamental shift however will require a transformation and redesign of the vehicle's technical architecture. Today, a vehicle's ADAS, communications, and entertainment features exist isolated in separate devices and systems and are purpose built, leading to duplicative functions, increased costs, and difficult control, management, maintenance, and upgrade of the system. This presentation will illustrate a central control system architecture built around an IoV Gateway, an open hardware platform that integrates ICT devices for future vehicles. Not only will this gateway orchestrate the common devices and CMS as a collective unit, this open architecture will allow for scalable, flexible and easy development of 3rd party equipment, such as V2X, and new applications. New modules and/or software applications for additional features, repairs, and upgrades can be added later without changing the existing system. This will reduce development efforts tremendously as the developer can focus on his or her subject matter expertise by adding on the features or applications onto the platform without changing the underlying system. © 2017 SAE International.},

abstract={Electrophysiology has recently evolved into an interactive, high-throughput endeavor. Recording from dozens to hundreds of electrodes is today routine; novel means of manipulating the system in real time, through electrical stimulation, optogenetics or sensory manipulation are allowing us to decipher neural circuit function at an unparalleled rate. To contribute to the wide dissemination of such techniques, we present an open hardware project, High-Channel Count Electrophysiology (HiCCE), aiming to produce low-cost, high-channel count (≥128 channels) electrophysiology instrumentation capable of fast data acquisition rates, real-time processing and feedback capabilities. Our design is centered on an open standard, FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC), which permits a varied choice of FPGA carrier architectures suited to different laboratory experimental needs. The HiCCE-128, a low-cost highperformance 128-channel data acquisition board for small voltage signals, is being introduced. It is a FMC module that can be operated from any FPGA carrier conforming to the FMC/VITA57 standard. This specialized board with a low input referred noise of about 3 μV is capable of acquiring 128 channels simultaneously at 31.25 kS/s per channel with 16 effective bits of resolution. We present the global architecture and some preliminary measurement to illustrate its potential for electrophysiological and medical applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The relationship between nurse and patient is vital as well as vulnerable on which a significant portion of well-being of patient depends. The recent growth of Internet of Things provides the opportunity to maintain this relationship in a more secure and efficient way. From this point of view, this paper presents a system of real-time nurse calling with focus centered on nurse feedback based on patient condition. The system also includes a robust archive monitoring system for review and trend analysis. In the proposed system, patients are able to call for assistance in time of emergency by pressing a designated button. After this, the device will send a real-time message containing information about the patients bed, room, and floor number to the appropriate nurse station. Nurse will respond as soon as the message is delivered, and optionally call for help by pressing designated buttons in the device. The proposed system reduces the delay in response of nurse. Additionally, the interactions are stored in Raspberry Pi database for future analysis to improve the quality of services. The proposed system uses low-cost hardware like ATMEGA328P microcontroller and ENC28J60 Ethernet controller, and Arduino Uno. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A prototype of a variable temperature insert has been developed in-house as a cryogenic thermometer calibration facility. It was commissioned in fulfilment of the very stringent requirements of the temperature control of the cryogenic system. The calibration facility is designed for calibrating industrial cryogenic thermometers that include a temperature sensor and the wires heat-intercept in the 2.2 K-325 K temperature range. The isothermal section of the calibration block onto which the thermometers are mounted is weakly linked with the temperature control zone mounted with cooling capillary coil and cryogenic heater. The connecting wires of the thermometer are thermally anchored with the support of the temperature insert. The calibration procedure begins once the temperature of the support is stabilized. Homogeneity of the calibration block's temperature is established both by simulation and by cross-comparison of two calibrated sensors. The absolute uncertainty present in temperature measurement is calculated and found comparable with the measured uncertainty at different temperature points. Measured data is presented in comparison to the standard thermometers at fixed points and it is possible to infer that the absolute accuracy achieved is better than ±0.5% of the reading in comparison to the fixed point temperature. The design and development of simpler, low cost equipment, and approach to analysis of the calibration results are discussed further in this paper, so that it can be easily devised by other researchers. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We investigate the possibility of performing workload forensics and/or malware detection in microprocessors through exclusively hardware-based methodologies. Specifically, we first introduce a general architecture which a hardware-based forensics or malware detection method would need to follow, as well as the various processor-level information which could potentially be harnessed to ensure system security and/or integrity. In contrast to traditional forensics and/or malware detection methods implemented at the operating system (OS) and/or the hypervisor level, whose data logging and monitoring systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks at the same level, moving implementation to hardware ensures immunity to such attacks. This work focuses on two recent incarnations of this general concept, illustrating the effectiveness of hardware-based forensics and/or malware detection. Several other recent methods related to this topic are also discussed. Experimental results corroborate that even a low-cost hardware implementation can facilitate highly successful forensics analysis and/or malware detection, while taking advantage of its innate immunity to software-based attacks. © 2016 IEEE.},

For this purpose, we have developed a method for detecting code clones in Verilog HDL. A key idea of the proposed method is to convert the Verilog HDL code into the pseudo C++ code, which is then processed by an existing code clone detector for C++. We conducted an experiment on 10 open source hardware products described in Verilog HDL, where we succeeded in detecting nearly 1,800 clone sets with approximately 80% precision. We compared code clones in Verilog HDL with those in Java/C based on the metrics to identify the differences among languages. We identified patterns on how code clones are created in Verilog HDL, which include cases for increasing stability and capability of parallel processing of the circuit. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks are composed of small autonomous devices known as motes. Usually these motes are power-limited and most energy is wasted through the communication process, thus the synchronization is critical. In this paper we improve the accuracy of time synchronization with Bayesian inference over the linear regression model used in synchronization protocols. Synchronization is generally accomplished using packet exchanges, so the goal is to reduce the number of packets while maintaining perfect synchronization. The constraints are the low-cost hardware components of the motes, in particular their clocks and the power consumption. Long-term synchronization is achieved using Adaptive Time Window Linear Regression algorithms using Least Squares. The method of Least Squares is distribution free, but we can make some feasible assumptions (experimentally validated) to improve these protocols using Bayesian Inference to achieve an improvement of 12% compared with the related work. In particular, using 80 MHz clock frequency in the motes the mean synchronization error is 147 ns. We propose an algorithm to improve the synchronization under these constraints and we test our method in real deployments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) merges real and virtual objects in order to make a richer environment with additional useful virtual information. Producing AR maintenance training depends on two major points that will be Interactivity and Reusability. Recently Augmented Reality becomes the new technology revolution in software applications such as (entertainment, training, military, E-shops and games), and the new generation of hardware computers, mobiles, and consoles which can support the AR view. Always there is a limitation about user interactivity in using keyboard, mouse, and touch screens as input for virtual reality applications. Hand Gesture Recognition using depth cameras is an innovative solution to easily interact and manipulate virtual scene objects which are needed for computer users widely in entertainment or military applications. This research presents a solution for those areas and helps to design more realistic application with low cost and good efficiency. Using IntelRealSense (RS) Camera, which is a low cost hardware and very helpful as gesture and depth capture camera. Maintenance training was chosen as the case study for a reusable AR framework. This paper present a solution to two major problems: First, the calculation of occlusion between the real and the virtual objects including human hand. Second, problem will be to discuss object collision detection, to add more realism between the gesture recognition and the dynamic virtual scene. The proposed framework is designed to overcome or enhance the problems of developing augmented reality scenes that can be used to integrate between natural human activities and virtual world or real time computer graphics. So, maintenance training framework could make it possible for users to be trained, and helped with real-time instructions which can be followed to achieve the task goal without need to reference guide or separate catalog. The proposed framework succeeded in implementing maintenance training with gesture recognition stability approximately 90 percent with continues picking selection. Each part movements and speed of gesture action transition took less than a second with medium hand speed with approximately 1 second hand pose for gesture recognition. © 2017 IEEE.},

Here we reproduce many of the results from these studies using portable low-cost equipment, focusing on the robustness of using ISC for subjects experiencing naturalistic stimuli. The present data shows that stimulus-evoked neural responses, known to be modulated by attention, can be tracked for groups of students with synchronized EEG acquisition.

abstract={Mobile robots are valuable tools for education because of both the enthusiasm they raise and the multidisciplinary nature of robotics technology. Mobile robots give access to a wide range of fields, such as complex mechanics, sensors, wireless transmission, mathematics, and computer science. However, despite their potential as educational tools, robots are still not as widespread in schools as they could be. In this article, we identify five key reasons: lack of diversity, high cost, noninclusive design, lack of educational material, and lack of stability over time. Then, we describe our answers to these problems, as we implemented them in the Thymio project: a mature mass-produced open-hardware robot, at a low price, with a multiage and gender-neutral feature set, and with a design promoting creativity, facilitating learning, and providing a wide range of interaction possibilities from built-in behaviors to text programming, passing through different visual programming environments. We highlight some neglected key issues that differentiate open-source hardware from open-source software, for instance the legal uncertainty of designing open hardware using professional computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the difficulty to distribute the development. Our solution to these being to increase the awareness of CAD editors to open-source hardware and to provide a two-layer development model for hardware. © 1994-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={To keep the hardware costs of future communications systems manageable, the use of low-cost hardware components is desirable. This is particularly true for the emerging massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems which equip base stations (BSs) with a large number of antenna elements. However, low-cost transceiver designs will further accentuate the hardware impairments, which are present in any practical communication system. In this paper, we investigate the impact of hardware impairments on the secrecy performance of downlink massive MIMO systems in the presence of a passive multiple-antenna eavesdropper. Thereby, for the BS and the legitimate users, the joint effects of multiplicative phase noise, additive distortion noise, and amplified receiver noise are taken into account, whereas the eavesdropper is assumed to employ ideal hardware. We derive a lower bound for the ergodic secrecy rate of a given user when matched filter data precoding and artificial noise (AN) transmission are employed at the BS. Based on the derived analytical expression, we investigate the impact of the various system parameters on the secrecy rate and optimize both the pilot sets used for uplink training and the AN precoding. Our analytical and simulation results reveal that: 1) the additive distortion noise at the BS may be beneficial for the secrecy performance, especially if the power assigned for AN emission is not sufficient; 2) all other hardware impairments have a negative impact on the secrecy performance; 3) despite their susceptibility to pilot interference in the presence of phase noise, so-called spatially orthogonal pilot sequences are preferable unless the phase noise is very strong; and 4) the proposed generalized null-space AN precoding method can efficiently mitigate the negative effects of phase noise. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditionally, multi-mission applications in airborne radar are implemented through very expensive phased array architectures. The emerging applications from civilian surveillance, on the other hand, prefer low-cost and low-SWaP (space, weight and power) systems. This study introduces a software-based solution that intends to use low-cost hardware and advanced algorithms/processing backend to meet the remote sensing goals for multi-mission applications. The low-cost airborne radar platform from Garmin International is used as a representative example of the system platform. The focus of this study is the optimal operating mode, data quality and algorithm development in cases of all-weather sense and avoid (SAA) applications. The main challenges for the solution are the resolution limitation due to the small aperture size, limitations from the field-of-view (FOV) and the scan speed from mechanical scanning. We show that the basic operational needs can be satisfied with software processing through various algorithms. The concept and progress of polarimetric airborne radar for dual-function operations at X-band Generation 1 (PARADOX1) based on the platform are also discussed. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Designing and testing flight control algorithms for quadrotor UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is not an easy task due to the risk of possible danger and damage during the practical flight. In order to improve the safety and efficiency of the flight control implementation, a low-cost real-Time HILS (hardware-in-The-loop simulation) testbed for quadrotor UAVs is developed in this paper. To realize the HILS testbed, a miniature quadrotor is used as the main body, equipped with a micro AHRS (attitude heading reference system) unit and a self-build DSP (digital signal processor) board. The HILS is implemented by using xPC target. A compact PC/104 computer is utilized as the target computer, and a laptop PC is employed as the host computer. A desktop PC is used as flight visualization computer which runs FlightGear and Google Earth to show visual data, such as orientation and flight path of the quadrotor UAV. This testbed can be utilized for simulating various flight control algorithms, without losing safeness and reliableness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed testbed, a new nonlinear adaptive sliding mode based stabilization control algorithm is developed and verified on the HILS testbed. © Cambridge University Press 2015.},

abstract={Direct-conversion radio transceivers can offer reprogrammable and low-cost hardware solutions for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio networks (CRNs). However, they are susceptible to radio-frequency (RF) impairments, such as in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance (IQI), which can significantly limit spectrum sensing capabilities. This paper is devoted to quantifying and evaluating the effects of IQI in single-and multichannel energy detectors operating in FD mode under both cooperative and noncooperative spectrum sensing scenarios. In this context, closed-form expressions are derived for the false alarm and detection probabilities in the general case, where partial self-interference suppression (SIS) and joint transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) IQI are considered. Furthermore, simplified closed-form expressions for the special cases, where either the RF front end is ideal or the SIS technique is perfect, are also presented. The presented analytical results have been verified through extensive simulations and indicate that the IQI and partial SIS can significantly affect spectrum sensing accuracy in FD-based CRNs. Specifically, if ideal RF front end is assumed, spectrum sensing error can significantly increase, leading to a reduction in the CRN performance and a negative effect on the performance of primary (PR) networks. Hence, when designing spectrum sharing algorithms for FD-based CRNs, the hardware impairments should be considered to improve the CRN performance while minimizing the negative effects on PR users. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The articles in this special section focus on the open-source movement taking over the robotics industry. Open source systems have already revolutionized a number of industries by empowering end users to contribute to the products that they need and want and by fueling grass-roots development and continual improvement of projects in completely new areas. While there have been innumerable successes in software and electronics hardware, open mechanical hardware is taking longer to catch on. There are a number of likely reasons for this, including the complexity, expense, and time associated with fabricating mechanical components as well as the challenge and reliability of assembling the wide range of mechanical and electronic components required to produce a fully functional system. In comparison with open-source software efforts, open hardware has numerous additional practical challenges associated with dissemination and evolution of the product driven by end users. However, rapid fabrication technologies have improved to the point of being able to produce parts that are strong, robust, and precise enough for practical robotic systems, and the pricing of the systems and supplies have lowered to the point that many of these machines are available in fabrication facilities at most universities. © 1994-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study, we introduce a modulation strategy for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) by using a simple and consumable-free modulator. This “Do-It-Yourself” interface comprised a 1.0 m×0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GC×GC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GC×GC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GC×GC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A method for directly measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using a mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed and tested. First, a compact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on vehicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1×12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100×100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio measurements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of -12 to 226CO2 ha-1 h-1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 25.9 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (summer) and 28.76 kgCO2 ha-1 h-1 (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R2 = 0:53 in summer and R2 = 0:47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within ±1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerodynamic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance. © Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Light Emitting diode (LED) video displays are future of large-area display market. Their scale, their durability and their ability to produce an attractive video in ambient light conditions, make them the favorable screens in all display systems. To increase the light quality of LED displays, it is necessary to improve the techniques that control the light variations while keeping stable energy consumption. This technique has become a major objective in the design of such displays systems. This paper presents a comparative study between two techniques to control brightness levels of LED displays, the first technique controls by varying direct current amplitude (DC), the second by varying the duty cycle of the current square wave with fixed amplitude (PWM). The paper also proposes an improved PWM solution, which is based on the approximation of the PWM curve to the DC curve in order to have the luminous efficiency as the last one. The demonstration is presented as a serial of mathematical calculations to choose the intermediate point and build low-cost hardware algorithm for this new method. The performance of this method is studied experimentally using the FPGA design and is compared with the PWM method. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

abstract={This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this language provides in the design and construction of hardware and software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However, this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in which the students will be participant of their own educational process. In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations- und Arbeitskooperations- System). It is an open source platform with some features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment. During the development of course, different kinds of resources were created and shared through this platform, these were subject to discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources. © 2016 IEEE.},

Therefore, robotics using inexpensive open source hardware and software is increasingly being used in innovative STEM education. But, developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are well behind the curve in the use of robots in schools and colleges. An innovative and extremely affordable robotic system is developed in this paper, whereby school children anywhere can go online and race multiple indoor mobile robots over the Internet. Virtual reality and force feedback are used to make the racing realistic and interactive. Children will be introduced to building their own inexpensive mobile robots using commercial, off-the-shelf components and materials. Advanced learners, e.g., college and university students, can modify and improve the hardware and software for Internet-based teleoperation. The project can be used to introduce or improve robotics education at a low cost among school children, while providing opportunities in service learning for college/university students. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system, nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The system allows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recorded with a 24-bit EEG system with minimum bandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The measurement of the relative phase of two sinusoidal electrical signals is a frequently encountered task in heterodyne interferometry, but also occurs in many other applications. Especially in interferometry, multi-radian detectors are often required, which track the temporal evolution of the phase difference and are able to register phase changes that exceed 2π. While a large variety of solutions to this problem is already known, we present an alternative approach, which pre-processes the signals with simple analog circuitry and digitizes two resulting voltages with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), whose sampling frequency can be far below the frequency of the sinusoidal signals. Phase reconstruction is finally carried out by software. The main advantage of this approach is its simplicity, using only few low-cost hardware components and a standard 2-channel ADC with low performance requirements. We present an application on the two-color interferometer of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, where the relative phase of 40 MHz sinusoids is measured. © 2017 EURATOM.},

abstract={Graphics processing units (GPUs) are a powerful platform for building the high-speed network traffic processing applications using low-cost hardware. The existing systems tap the massively parallel architecture of GPUs to speed up certain computationally intensive tasks, such as cryptographic operations and pattern matching. However, they still suffer from significant overheads due to critical-path operations that are still being carried out on the CPU, and redundant inter-device data transfers. In this paper, we present GASPP, a programmable network traffic processing framework tailored to modern graphics processors. GASPP integrates optimized GPU-based implementations of a broad range of operations commonly used in the network traffic processing applications, including the first purely GPU-based implementation of network flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly. GASPP also employs novel mechanisms for tackling the control flow irregularities across SIMT threads, and for sharing the memory context between the network interfaces and the GPU. Our evaluation shows that GASPP can achieve multigigabit traffic forwarding rates even for complex and computationally intensive network operations, such as stateful traffic classification, intrusion detection, and packet encryption. Especially when consolidating multiple network applications on the same system, GASPP achieves up to 16.2 × speedup compared with different monolithic GPU-based implementations of the same applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Glial cells, also known as neuroglia or glia, are non-neuronal cells providing support and protection for neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). They also act as supportive cells in the brain. Among a variety of glial cells, the star-shaped glial cells, i.e., astrocytes, are the largest cell population in the brain. The important role of astrocyte such as neuronal synchronization, synaptic information regulation, feedback to neural activity and extracellular regulation make the astrocytes play a vital role in brain disease. This paper presents a modified complete neuron-astrocyte interaction model that is more suitable for efficient and large scale biological neural network realization on digital platforms. Simulation results show that the modified complete interaction model can reproduce biological-like behavior of the original neuron-astrocyte mechanism. The modified interaction model is investigated in terms of digital realization feasibility and cost targeting a low cost hardware implementation. Networking behavior of this interaction is investigated and compared between two cases: i) the neuron spiking mechanism without astrocyte effects, and ii) the effect of astrocyte in regulating the neurons behavior and synaptic transmission via controlling the LTP and LTD processes.

abstract={Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided - Wearing the Web - in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={KdUINO buoy, a moored citizen science system with low-cost sensors is based on the open hardware platform Arduino and quasi digital optical light sensors that measure a parameter related to water transparency, the diffuse attenuation coefficient. The buoy also has a real-time clock and an SD memory card to save data and the time of the measurements. Volunteers tested KdUINOs in Canada and Antarctica. They did some preliminary tests with KdUINOs where they compared light diffuse attenuation coefficient between Ramsey Lake and Lake Laurentian. Ramsey Lake has depths up to 100 m, a diverse population of fish and normal pH for the boreal region of Canada. KdUINO was deployed through fall freeze and left in place until spring melt through winter 2015, with atmospheric temperatures down to -20° C during the winter, and it worked properly under these freezing weather conditions. The preliminary tests concluded that Ramsey Lake was found to have a Kd about six times lower than Lake Laurentian, indicating, as expected, that Ramsey Lake is much more transparent than Lake Laurentian. In Antarctica, taking advantage of the annual research campaigns of the Hesperides vessel, a volunteer, who was a technician of the ship, made measurements using the KdUINO at 60° S and 61° S. The temperature of the water/air of the sampling points was 1.5° C and -2° C. light diffuse attenuation coefficient values obtained are within the expected values in this region.},

abstract={High-throughput ADN sequencing technologies, also known as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), have a huge impact in the development of bioinformatic tools. NGS generate massive amounts of data that support biomedical research, and assessing the quality of these data is a crucial task but also an important computational challenge. In the last ten years Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as one of the major paradigms for solving complex problems using parallel computing techniques on commodity hardware. This paper presents Sodium, a high performance tool that efficiently evaluates the quality of NGS data using GPUs. Our experimental evaluation, performed on low-cost hardware, shows promising results. In particular, we observe acceleration values of up to 2 digits when our proposal is compared with FastQC, one of the most popular tools to evaluate the quality of NGS sequences. © 2016 IEEE.},

However, the intensive mathematical computations involved in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), create performance bottlenecks for a number of applications involving web servers, cloud computing infrastructures, and data centers. Side-by-side, software implementations of ECC are plagued with several implementation specific attacks. Reconfigurable hardware accelerators for ECC can solve both these problems. It can provide the necessary speeds to match the performance requirements of the applications, and can also provide an isolated environment, which can prevent several known attacks.

abstract={There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)—this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS—located on the user’s computer. The proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Two PI controllers are used to track he target velocities. The proposed realtime path generator generates SPP (single polar polynomial) curves for the curved path and can handle the speed and acceleration constraints of the actuators of the mobile robot. The proposed path generator does not need to store the entire path information over time. It computes and saves the minimum information required to generate the path offline and generates all path references in real-time. The proposed method is implemented in Arduino Due, which is an open source hardware, and applied to a lab-built mobile to demonstrate that the proposed tracking control system can be implemented on a small scale system such as a microcontroller. © ICROS 2017.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an implementation method for a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator for an inverted pendulum system using low cost open-source hardware. We adopted the Arch Max (ARM Cortex-M4-based open-source hardware) as an HIL simulator platform. Using the nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) mechanism of the Cortex-M4 core, we assigned three interrupts with different priorities to handle three parts of the HIL simulator. The model equation of the inverted pendulum system was solved in real-time using the Runge-Kutta method in a timer interrupt service routine. An input capture interrupt-based method was used to simulate the motor drive by converting the duty ratio of pulse width modulation (PWM) signals into the voltage level applied to a DC motor. To simulate incremental rotary encoders, which are two sensors for the inverted pendulum system, a timer interrupt-based quadrature pulse generation algorithm was presented and to generate the quadrature pulse more accurately, an error compensation method was also provided. Finally, animation functionality to give a visual indication of how the controller is progressing was implemented through Vpython. Through experiments, we illustrated that the proposed HIL simulator successfully simulates the real inverted pendulum and is useful for teaching students about designing a working controller through programming embedded devices. © ICROS 2017.},

The study has been performed within tested area, using MAV with construction and design based only on open hardware technology. All image data gathered have been post processed using recently developed open source toolkit for aerial drone mapping – Open Drone Map. The presented open source approach for digital surface model delivery has been compared with pure commercial approach. The commercial approach, for the same case and area, has been performed by a state of art commercial MAV technology and software. Results show differences between both approaches in data processing, accuracy and digital surface modeling. The paper concludes both process usability and ability t o perform a geodetic grade surface modeling within presented case, and foreseen its usability of Open Drone Map toolkit for academic education purposes and researches. © SGEM2017.

First, various sensor information can be acquired through Arduino Due's rich peripherals. Second, the acquired information is delivered to a PC through Ethernet communication of Raspberry Pi, which is an IoT device. Third, easy use is supported through a lab-built user interface. In the proposed system, the acquisition of sensor information and processing of control commands are performed on Arduino Due, and the measured information is designed to be transmitted to Raspberry Pi through SPI communication. A lab-built GUI program is introduced to efficiently display the received the sensor information on a PC efficiently. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed system, an HILS (hardware-inthe- loop simulator), which simulates the greenhouse phenomenon, is implemented using Arduino Nano.

abstract={The availability of cheap but powerful sensors and signal processing hardware allows the solution of problems, which previously could only be solved at high costs and efforts. In this paper we describe an approach to locate an acoustic sound source by three low cost microphones and operational amplifiers in combination with a simple microcontroller using its embedded analog/digital converters. There are several applications, e.g. the detection of the direction and distance of a police car by the sound of its siren or the location of a speaking person by an assistance robot in a household. The complete real-time analog/digital signal processing chain using cheap hardware is in the focus of this approach. By deriving an approximate solution for the location equations, the approach becomes suitable for low-cost microcontrollers. © 2017 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent years, many internet of things (IoT) platforms based on cloud computing have been proposed for general purpose applications. Though many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source hardware devices.

abstract={Following the successful adoption of the open source model in the software realm, open source is becoming a new design paradigm in hardware development. Open source models for tangible products are still in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and founders of twentythree companies were interviewed to understand their motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2) Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur whose identity is as a for-profit company leader. © 2017 ASME.},

However, developing an FPGA-based system is challenging because the complexity of the hardware and software co-design. In this paper, we propose a platform named hCODE to simplify the design, share, and deployment of FPGA accelerators. First, we adopt a shell-and-IP design pattern to improve the reusability and the portability of accelerator designs. Second, we implement an open accelerator repository to bridge hardware development and software development on one platform. On the hCODE platform, hardware developers can provide designs that follow hCODE specifications, which allowing software engineers to easily search, download, and integrate accelerators in their applications without caring about the hardware details. © 2017 Information Processing Society of Japan},

abstract={Visual sensing can be difficult to incorporate into undergraduate robotics and AI assignments. Images, after all, do not provide a direct estimate of the geometric conditions within the field of view. Yet vision is increasingly compelling as a part of undergraduate AI and robotics, given the centrality of pixels in our students' interactions with technology and each other. This paper shares a small-footprint framework designed to make visual sensing as easy to incorporate into AI projects and assignments, e.g., as a source of evidence for localization algorithms, as range sensors. The framework leverages (hand-built) circular panoramas and the image-matching capabilities provided by OpenCV's python library. An example localization project highlights its pedagogical accessibility and ease of deployment atop low-cost hardware and alongside other sensors. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={In the following paper, the authors propose an effective and reliable solution to the HD mapping problem. The solution is composed of relatively low-cost hardware components, if compared to the most advanced HD mapping solutions available on the market. The core of the solution is a robust post-processing algorithm that processes the point-cloud generated by a LiDAR, the frames collected by three cameras, the data coming from a GNSS receiver and an IMU, and the odometry data available on the car’s CAN BUS. After the generation of the georeferenced point-cloud, the post processing algorithm extracts road geometries, objects and features to build HD maps. Such solution was developed and tested on our research car, and tested in Garching, near Munich, Germany. The results of the 3D mapping system are presented later, showing how the combination of low-cost technologies with a strong data fusion algorithm can provide exceptional performance. © VDE verlag GMBH ∙ Berlin ∙ Offenbach.},

abstract={Open hardware platforms are gaining wide popularity in various fields of technology for their accessibility and inexpensiveness. Although availability of these platforms is undeniable, the performance of these machines in handling tasks which require execution within critical time constraints is still in question. Moreover, technical documentation and support for open hardware are scarce in comparison to expensive commercially distributed platforms. In this paper, we present a detailed process to implement embedded Linux and the real-time extension of Xenomai to two popular open embedded hardware, BeagleBone Black and i. MX6Q SABRELite. Also, we analyze the response time of real-time mechanisms and its performance for inter-task communication (ITC) between real-time tasks. Response time of real-time mechanisms is an important measure to predict the realtime performance of each platform. The performance evaluation is performed both in kernel space and user space using the metrics of jitter, to estimate the periodicity of the cyclic task, and execution time of three real-time mechanisms including semaphore, message queue, and message pipe. The results of this study would serve as a guideline in developing real-time systems on low cost open embedded hardware platforms using the real-time Linux extension of Xenomai.

abstract={Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 MΩ show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Meat is one of foodstuff that widely consumed in the world. Unfortunately, the quality of meat can easily degrade if not handled properly and become the serious health hazards if consumed. Hence, the food safety system is very important to guarantee the quality of food to be consumed. In this study, we introduced the development of mobile electronic nose for beef quality detection and monitoring. This system is developed using low-cost hardware and possible to integrate with cooling box or refrigerator for real time monitoring and analysis during distribution and storage processes. K-Nearest Neighbor with signal preprocessing is used to classify two, three, and four classes of beef. The experimental results show that the system can perfectly distinguish fresh and spoiled beef. Moreover, it has promising classification accuracy for binary, three classes, and four classes classification with 93.64%, 86.00%, and 85.50%, respectively. Hence, this system has a potential solution to provide low-cost, easy to use, and real-time meat quality monitoring system. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={The bending stiffness of the wind turbine blades has decreased due to the trend of wind turbine upsizing. Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The geolocation of people is a field of research that is in continuous development. Currently, the vast majority of systems that can locate people, are used in open spaces that can directly be viewed from the outside using GPS technology. This technology is based on very weak satellite signals and is not suitable for all types of scenarios. When a child gets lost inside a building, the parents inform the guards responsible for building security; an alarm is announced and different actions are undertaken in order to find the child. The steps taken during the search are based on manual procedures; all rooms in the building are searched and security cameras are reviewed. This is why it is crucial to research new solutions which will allow for the localization of individuals in enclosed spaces such as sports stadiums, museums, shopping malls etc. In the last decade, indoor location systems (IPS) have experienced increased growth due to reduced production costs of hardware and miniaturization of device size. This work focuses on the design of an architecture that allows for the monitoring, localization and identification of individuals (especially children or dependent persons) indoors through the use of low cost hardware. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

This methodology is validated using a commercial indoor PVSC that has been tested for several illuminance levels at a room temperature and warm white LED (light-emitting diode) spectrum. The extracted model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.85% for the illuminance ranging from 177 to 33.3 × 103 lm/m2.

The aim of the present paper is to introduce an open hardware and open software platform dedicated to SHM within the fields of aeronautics and civil engineering.

The main electronic components used, are the Arduino controller and the wireless information transmitter using the free bandwidth in the world: 2.4GHz, which allows programming a more effective communication network (ZigBee Network); the power supply is based on photovoltaic cells (5V). The ZigBee Network Technology achieved its goal of keeping all interconnected points. The limited range of the transmitters (1500m) was overcome by the use of interconnected network points, which can build a grid to cover the entire field. The tested prototype was composite of four points in a transmition station - simulating a control room The system is based on good quality and low cost equipment, that aims to reduce the production deferment and artificial lift equipment failures; by the implementation of a system that generates alerts according to the monitored parameters.

abstract={Presently, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are being used extensively in the defense, private, domestic, etc. fields and each of these emulates a personal area network (PAN). A MANET does not require any infrastructure; moreover, it can behave as a mobile network. These features have boosted the popularity of MANETs in the community. As more and more fields become dependent on MANETs, the system needs to be more energy aware and low cost. To commercialize MANETs, the routing protocols need to be lightweight, secure, and energy efficient, and the hardware on which it is to be implemented should be low cost at the same time. In this paper, we have proposed a lightweight, energy aware, secure routing model for MANETs, which has been implemented on low-cost hardware. Our model uses fidelity to allocate trust to a neighbor, thereby taking the decision whether to send data via that secure neighbor or not. It also uses packets like Report and Recommendation that help the protocol to detect and eliminate the malicious nodes from the network. To make the protocol energy aware we have formulated new battery thresholds, so that the battery can be monitored and losses can be minimized. To observe the results we implement this protocol in hardware, on the Arduino platform, which is a scalable, reliable, cheap, and open source. We observe that our protocol exhibits high packet delivery fraction, low normalize routing load, and low end to end delay, compared to existing secure routing protocols. © 2017 TÜBITAK.},

abstract={Functionality and cost are two key factors for open architecture machine tools. Dynamic reconfiguration technology provides a method to achieve more functions at low cost. Hardware dynamic reconfiguration is special feature of FPGA devices. In this paper, a dynamic reconfigurable interpolator with linear, circular and NURBS interpolations is presented. The functions of interpolator can be reconfigured during machining. The requirement for logic resource on-chip reduces evidently, which makes it feasible to implement complicated interpolations using a limited area. Experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the dynamic reconfigurable interpolator.},

To over-come the shortcomings of flat directory structures, hierarchical directory structures are used. An insignificant fault in the sharer set representation of such a directory may introduce major inconsistency throughout the system. Therefore, the current work targets detection of any faulty recording in the sharer set representation of a hierarchical directory. The solution is developed around a special class of Cellular Automata (CA) with single length cycle attractors. The CA based design ensures low cost hardware implementation as well as high-speed operation. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.},

abstract={Currently, the water crisis is not only visible in Brazil but almost everywhere and it arises where water scarcity becomes a global challenge or environmental concerns about the shortage of drinking water. The need to have water available for consumption is critical, since, in turn, it is the main source for life on Earth. Despite all of Earth’s water found, only 2.5% of it is freshwater. From this smallest part, 70% of it is used in agriculture, 23% by industries and 7% for human consumption. This paper presents an embedded system prototype for air dehumidifying which has the main purpose of obtaining water (by means of condensation). Others benefits include low cost, low size, portability and an Internet of Things application approach. The dehumidifier uses an aluminum plate around 36 cm2 and about 0.5 mm thickness, a thermoelectric Peltier tablet, a breadboard UNO R3 arduino, wires jumper, transistors TIP122 and 1 KΩ (Ohm) resistors. Within the initial results, we verified the condensed water in the aluminum and the formation of water repeatedly and controlled. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is an extended astroparticle observatory with the goal of studying Gamma Ray Bursts (among other extreme universe phenomena), space weather and atmospheric radiation at ground level. It consists of a network of several Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCD) located at different sites and different latitudes along the American Continent (from Mexico up to the Antarctic region). Another interest of LAGO is to encourage and support the development of experimental basic research in Latin America, mainly with low cost equipment. In the case of Chiapas, Mexico, the experimental astroparticle physics activity was limited, up to now, to data analysis from other detectors located far away from the region. Thanks to the collaboration within LAGO, the deployment of one WCD is ongoing at the Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas (UNACH). This will allow, for the first time in the region, to train students and researchers in the deployment processes. Till now the setup of the signal-processing electronics has been performed and the characterization of the photomultiplier tube is currently being done. The main, short-term goal is to install one WCD on top of the Tacaná volcano in Chiapas in a short term. The status of the work is presented.

Here each vehicle is placed with RFID tag. Whenever the RFID reader reads the RFID tag in the stolen vehicle it alert the traffic police and the signal will be automatically changed into red light until the vehicle is recovered from the stolen person. This is achieved by connecting cloud technology with server which is handle by the traffic police. When the traffic controller ensures that the particular vehicle is missed then, whenever that particular vehicle crossed by the any signal red light blinks automatically then cloud displays the message with vehicle number.By using this system, we can alert the signal and can easily find the stolen vehicle by tracking the RFID tag. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

This curriculum, combined with the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after the end of which, students’ achievements are evaluated. The result is that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and use various skills to produce their own works. Therefore, there is little difference between women and men in scores of achievement test. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Dynamic phenomena on nanoscale have continuously attracted attention from various research fields. However, due to the limit of the imaging rate, it is difficult to observe the dynamic processes by conventional atomic force microscope (AFM). In recent years, a considerable variety of important improvements on the AFM system for high-speed imaging have been proposed and demonstrated. In this mini review, we briefly present the latest research works on the development of high-speed AFM (HSAFM) from the view of instrumentation. Besides commercially available instruments, many schemes for the design and construction of HSAFM system for different applications are summarized. Also, the low-cost hardware and software upgrading options from conventional AFM to HSAFM are compared. Furthermore, the requirements for each component in the AFM control loop are analyzed. Finally, challenges and future works of HSAFM are discussed. This review would be beneficial for the development of new HSAFM imaging systems. © 2017 by American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={A steady usage growth of various smart meters/sensors types comes along with the development of Smart Grid. Due to that smart meters/sensors usually produce data continuously, the state-of-The-Art storage architecture will no longer be sustainable under such a dramatic data increase circumstance. It is crucial that these data shall be stored for both short and long term analysis to seek valuable information. This paper proposed a scalable and distributed storage architecture for time series data, and further substantiated the proposed storage framework on a proof-of-concept testbed using a cluster of low-cost and credit-card-sized single-board computers. We evaluated the proposed distributed storage framework and proof-of-concept testbed with a comprehensive set of performance measures. Results showed that low-cost hardware and open source technologies could be utilized for large-scale time series data storage. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.},

abstract={This article investigates a potential application of low cost computer hardware and open source software in machining areas of Learning Factories. Based on the implementation of an optical object detection to discover human errors in the setup process of a milling machine, the paper presents an example of how value stream improvements in Learning Factories can be achieved by student projects. Therefore, the process of identifying possible solutions which are suitable for solving a problem in the value stream of a Learning Factory is described. In the presented case, this is an IT-solution to establish a Poka-Yoke system for depositing a work piece in a milling machine correctly. A solution, which uses a Raspberry Pi, is developed and integrated in the process. Furthermore, the ability of low cost hardware components and simple algorithms resting upon freely available software libraries to fulfil the requirements of modern manufacturing is demonstrated. Finally, this study illustrates that the implementation of in-house low cost digitalization rather rests on a profound understanding of the affected manufacturing process than on previous knowledge of programming or electronics. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Purpose - The additive manufacturing technologies have been facing an extraordinary growth along the past years. This phenomenon might be correlated with rise of low-cost FDM technologies into the non-professional market segment. In contrast with that, among the main disadvantages found in this sort of equipment are the final object finishing and low mechanical strength. For that reason, the purpose of this paper is to present and characterise a surface treatment which is based on solvent vapour attack and that is also known as smoothing process. In addition, a concise overview about the theory beneath this process is presented besides an experimental study that evaluates the main effects on the mechanical properties of object. Design/methodology/approach - To analyse the benefits of this process, the authors preliminarily investigated the working mechanism that supports such surface treatment. It allowed them to identify and select a proper solvent for each material. The authors have also established that the exposure time repetition numbers (passes) were the main variables, whereas temperature, solvent type, drying time, object direction and object shape were constants. The main object dimensions, surface roughness, absorbed solvent mass and mechanical strength were the main study responses. Findings - As a result of this work, the peak-peak roughness was reduced in 71 per cent, indicating the potential benefit of this process. On the other hand, excessive solvent exposure implied on relevant dimensional distortions and internal disruptures. It was also possible to see that the vapourised solvent penetrate into the object surface and fused layers and filaments. As consequence, the mechanical strength was also improved. Originality/value - Despite the growth that additive manufacturing market segment has seen along the past years, the finishing and mechanical strength of low-cost equipment still lack for improvements. For that reason, applications like solvent vapour attack or smoothing process new perspectives for this non-professional segment, whereas roughness and mechanical strength are improved after its treatment. As a consequence, it is possible to consider a final object to be obtained directly from low-cost FDM in combination with smoothing process. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for a vision-based automatic landing of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a moving platform. The landing system must be highly accurate and meet the size, weigh, and power restrictions of a small UAV. Design/methodology/approach: The vision-based landing system consists of a pattern of red markers placed on a moving target, an image processing algorithm for pattern detection, and a servo-control for tracking. The suggested approach uses a color-based object detection and image-based visual servoing. Findings: The developed prototype system has demonstrated the capability of landing within 25 cm of the desired point of touchdown. This auto-landing system is small (100×100 mm), light-weight (100 g), and consumes little power (under 2 W). Originality/value: The novelty and the main contribution of the suggested approach are a creative combination of work in two fields: image processing and controls as applied to the UAV landing. The developed image processing algorithm has low complexity as compared to other known methods, which allows its implementation on general-purpose low-cost hardware. The theoretical design has been verified systematically via simulations and then outdoors field tests. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The number of disposable molecular diagnostics tests in the IVD market has been growing rapidly and is bound to continue to grow in the near future. The internal complexity of these rapid tests increases with the complexity of the diagnostic assay implemented by them. Some assays require precise temperature control (±1°C–5°C) for an extended time (i.e. 15–60 minutes) for the reactions involved to run properly. Microheating components in them must meet strict criteria with respect to power consumption, physical size and cost. The proposed finite element model is intended to provide tools for in silico validation of device designs (geometries, structural materials), as well as to help in the interpretation of heat transfer processes inside the thermal system present in a molecular diagnostics device. The proposed model was developed for and validated with polyimide etched foil heating elements actively controlled via a mini-thermostat. The thermostat was designed for battery-based operation and implemented with open-source hardware (Arduino-compatible). Plastic test structures were created that emulated disposable Lab-on-a-Chip devices with microfluidic channels to hold liquid volumes on the scale of 0.1 mL. The experimental setup was demonstrated to maintain target temperatures over at least 30 minutes with at least ±1°C around the set point operated from batteries. Physical parameters of the resistive heating element used were fed into the finite element model and simulation results compared to the performance of the aforementioned experimental setup. © 2017 WIT Press.},

abstract={Light field cameras are an emerging technology with unique post-processing capabilities. For certain light field applications such as synthetic aperture photography, existing calibration procedures are either metric calibrations that are difficult to execute with low-cost hardware, or non-metric procedures that are inflexible to arbitrary sub-camera pose or require cameras with tightly controlled poses. We present a novel and comparatively simple non-metric procedure for light field acquisition that estimates the geometric transforms between camera images with respect to a calibration plane. The procedure is suitable for mobile camera arrays, and flexible to unknown or varied sub-camera pose. It only requires one image from each camera of a calibration pattern positioned to span the camera array's full field of view. We also provide a quantitative measure of calibration quality, and use it to demonstrate the procedure's efficacy with our Raspberry Pi camera array. The results highlight the procedure's robustness to variable camera orientation in contrast to existing state of the art techniques. Finally, we present qualitative results by rendering light fields at varying levels of focus and occlusion, and demonstrate success in capturing and rendering light field video.},

The adaptively estimated noise PSD in each frame is then employed in a cue-preserving MMSE-based noise-reduction spectral gain function.

abstract={Power quality is a growing concern as the number of electric sensitive loads is increasing day by day in all fields. Poor power quality is badly affecting sensitive loads causing instability, malfunctioning, loss of data and great loss of economy. Thus, there is a need to improve power quality for which it is required to identify power quality problems occurring in the power system. This paper presents a low cost hardware to detect and classify most occurring power quality problems in the power system such as voltage sag, swell, interruption and unbalance using PIC microcontroller 18F452 for a 3-phase system. An algorithm is developed and the program is written into the microcontroller for classification. The program checks the conditions of the power quality problems based on the magnitudes of 3-phase voltages and classifies them. The system mainly consists of voltage sensing unit and microcontroller which senses 3-phase voltages, identifies the problem and gives output through LCD display, buzzer and LEDs showing type of power quality problem and p.u. voltage values. The circuit also trips load during power quality problems and connects it during normal conditions. The outputs of the hardware are given for various cases of the power quality problems. © 2017 The Author(s).

Methods: Nanoprecipitation presents some advantages because it is a straightforward method with low-cost equipment that is easy to scale up. Results: However, there are two technical issues of concern related to this method. First, the two solvents used for this approach must be miscible; concomitantly, the drug has to be soluble enough in a solvent but not in the antisolvent. Second, the particle growth needs to be adjusted by surfactant addition.

abstract={Ambient Intelligence is growing phenomena caused by advances of speed and size of computational hardware. It is possible to collect data from various sensors, devices or services and react to evaluated event and start the predefined process. These systems are closely connected with Cloud based services as they provide publicly available interface for management and visualization, computational and storage capabilities for forecasts and other advanced data processing to create ambient intelligence environment. The true ambient environments react to the presence of people and the sensors and actuators have become part of the environment. This article presents RoboPhery project aimed to provide abstraction layer for interfacing any low cost hardware sensors and actuators with MQTT and Time-series Database bindings, that can serve as sensory network for Ambient Intelligence environments. The service architecture is designed to be so simple at hardware level to support single-board micro-controllers like ESP2866, ESP32 modules as well as single-board computers based on ARM or x86 architectures. The communication among individual devices is handled by the standard MQTT messages. The same devices can be configured to support multiple use-cases on configuration level to lower the operational costs of the solution. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={The current number of patients are increasing day by day in various countries. Present advances in computing technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided economical and low cost equipment’s like cameras, embedded devices, smartphones. Embedded computing empowers the deployment of Smart Health care applications that can improve medical treatment effectively. Most of existing Health Monitoring systems are vulnerable to environmental and operational damages. These existing systems are not guaranteed end to end trust for patient health data. Most of existing methods energy performance are very poor in terms of communication latency and communication overhead. We propose an energy aware end-to-end trust mechanism for IoT healthcare applications. We discuss how to provide end to end trust for IoT health applications and how to improve the efficiency of health care applications. The results of the evaluation determine the effectiveness of proposed method. When compared to existing method our proposed technique reduces 24% communication overhead and 18% latency between end user and gateways and provides end to end trust for medical data transferring from on medical sensor node to another. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

abstract={Open source frameworks have enabled widespread access to desktop-scale additive manufacturing technology and software, but very few highly hackable large-scale or industrial open source equipment platorms exist. As research trajectories contnue to move towards large-scale experimentation and full-scale building construction in robotc and digital fabrication, access to industrial fabrication equipment is critcal. Large-scale digital fabrication equipment usually requires extensive start-up investments which becomes a prohibitive factor for open research. Expanding on the idea of the Fab Lab as well as the RepRap movement, the Open Source Factory takes advantage of disciplinary expertise and trans-disciplinary knowledge in construction machine design accumulated over the past decade. With the goal to democratze access to large-scale industrial fabrication equipment, this paper outlines the creation of two full-scale fabrication systems: a RepRap based large-scale 3-axis open source CNC gantry and a 6-axis industrial robot system based on a decommissioned KUKA KR200/2. Both machines offer radically different economic frameworks for implementng research in advanced full scale robotc fabrication into contexts of pedagogy, the research lab, practce, or small scale local building industry. This research demonstrates that such equipment can be implemented by building on the current knowledge base in the field. If industrial robots and other large-scale fabrication tools become accessible for all, the collective sharing of research and the development of new ideas in full-scale robotc building construction can be substantially accelerated. © 2017 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

abstract={Synthetic transmit aperture beamforming is an increasingly used method to improve resolution in biomedical ultrasound imaging. Synthetic aperture sequential beamforming (SASB) is an implementation of this concept which features a relatively low computation complexity. Moreover, it can be implemented in a dual-stage architecture, where the first stage only applies simple single receive-focused delay-and-sum (srDAS) operations, while the second, more complex stage is performed either locally or remotely using more powerful processing. However, like traditional DAS-based beamforming methods, SASB is susceptible to inaccurate speed-of-sound (SOS) information. In this paper, we show how SOS estimation can be implemented using the srDAS beamformed image, and integrated into the dual-stage implementation of SASB, in an effort to obtain high resolution images with relatively low-cost hardware. Our approach builds on an existing per-channel radio frequency data-based direct estimation method, and applies an iterative refinement of the estimate. We use this estimate for SOS compensation, without the need to repeat the first stage beamforming. The proposed and previous methods are tested on both simulation and experimental studies. The accuracy of our SOS estimation method is on average 0.38% in simulation studies and 0.55% in phantom experiments, when the underlying SOS in the media is within the range 1450-1620 m/s. Using the estimated SOS, the beamforming lateral resolution of SASB is improved on average 52.6% in simulation studies and 50.0% in phantom experiments. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={The working principle of nearly all uncooled microbolometer thermal imaging systems is based on the rolling shutter principle. This results in time delays between rows giving rise to distorted and blurred images which are difficult to correlate with, for example instantaneous numerical simulation results for nondestructive evaluation. Until today high-end and high-cost thermal cameras need to be used for instantaneous measurements. Furthermore, quantitative defect evaluation on average conductive materials is difficult to perform as a result of the rolling shutter blur of the uncooled cameras. In this contribution, a time delay compensation method is designed. The developed algorithm is described and a measurement routine is elaborated to measure the inter- and intra-frame delays between two pixels. Finally, an artificial global shutter image sequence is developed using linear interpolation between the original fluctuating frames. We will show that by applying our proposed method, the intra-frame delay can be predicted and compensated with an accuracy of 16μs. Besides, there is only made use of low-cost equipment to provide a straight-forward methodology which makes it applicable for the further integration of low-cost microbolometers in industry. This means that we have made the application of low-cost microbolometers feasible for instantaneous measurements. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={An odorant system manufactured by LEWA GmbH was installed in 2004 at Suape Terminal facilities in Pernambuco, Brazil and in 2006, it was integrated into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), using a proprietary module that translated LEWA's protocol to to MODBUS RTU protocol. This modulo periodically stopped operation, requiring physical reset. In 2008 after an reset it stopped permanently. There weren't an spare module or a new one to buy - it was not commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item. This work presents the developing of solution using a COTS industrial box PC, with open sources software components to provide serial communication, MODBUS TCP/IP server, system logger, besides the use of a Linux operational system and a free integrated development environment (IDE) for coding over the Java Open JDK - the Java open source development kit. We discuss the software architecture that permits synchronization between commands and data read beside error signaling; the implementation of an Arduino - open source hardware - simulator for the odorant system, that responds to commands and reads like a LEWA's unit; long time tests; and MODBUS TCP/IP server table. This solution for Suape Terminal were also adopted in 2013 for Santos Terminal in São Paulo, Brazil, where there are two others odorant units. The subject matter is extended to describe the solution for an issue observed in 2015, after some years in production - the pump running signaling, that was obtained by the read of odorant flow totalizer, for low flow rate, flaws with successive on and off indications. This problem conducted us to create an virtual flow rate indicator - the odorant's controller doesn't provides this signal -, using a Kalman Filter as estimator. We describe the problem symptoms, model construction and the computer solution through public-domain Java's math library - JAMA -, a kind of open source software package, created at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for numeric linear algebra, to construct and manipulate matrices.

abstract={Objective: To ascertain the validity and reliability of intra and inter evaluators of the use of stopwatches and videos in order to record the runtime of Line Drill Test compared to a photocell system. Method: 22 academic basketball and handball players performed the Line Drill Test in a single attempt. Photocells (gold standard) and evaluators with manual stopwatches recorded the runtime of the Line Drill Test simultaneously. At the same time, the test was videotaped in order to be analyzed by blinded evaluators. The following indexes were calculated: a) intraclass correlation coefficient, b) coefficient of variation, c) maximum absolute difference in the same test and d) typical error. Results: there were no differences among equipment. Evaluators and equipments showed high and positive correlation (r = 0.993 to r = 1.000; p <. 0.001 for all). The indexes between stopwatches and photocells were intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.995 (p <. 0.001), coefficient of variation % = 0.85%, maximum absolute difference = 1.08. s and typical error = 0.13. s; and the indexes between videos and photocells were: intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.999 (p <. 0.001), coefficient of variation % = 0.60%, maximum absolute difference = 0.52. s and typical error = 0.07. s.

abstract={The monitoring of precipitation amounts plays an important role in the estimation of water balance as well as in the understanding of complex hydrological processes taking part in a catchment. High spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall could have a significant impact on the reliability of the performed hydrological analyses, which puts an increasing demand on sampling frequency and density of monitoring network. This is especially important in the case of small catchments, often with a small number or no monitoring stations at all, and local analyses where higher sampling frequency is a must. The relatively high cost of the commercial rain gauges, communication systems and post-processing software is the main reason why the collection of the precipitation amounts and the density of the monitoring network is still a challenge especially in developing countries. Latest advances in the low-cost open-source hardware and software sensor and electronics platforms together with the reduced costs and improved precision of 3D printers enable to design, develop and deploy custom low-cost measurement equipment. In this study a low-cost two-chamber tipping-bucket type rain gauge was designed and constructed. The electronics and the software of the gauge utilized an open-source Arduino platform, with the body of the gauge printed on a 3D printer using a fused filament fabrication technology, and an ABS thermoplastic polymer. The study describes the construction of the gauge and the function of the control software. However, the main goal of the study was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the gauge in laboratory conditions and to calibrate a volume of water needed to tip the bucket from one position into another. In order to reduce the uncertainty the proposed laboratory experiment was conducted several times with various artificial rainfall intensities. The results showed a small variance in the values of the estimated volumes needed to tip the bucket as well as a clear positive relationship between these values and the rainfall intensities. © SGEM2017 All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The Center for Space Research has been operating four neutron monitor (NM) stations since the 1960s and has also developed mini neutron monitors, initially to calibrate the stations. To upgrade the aging electronics in the NMs, a new electronic system has been developed. The aim of the new electronic design is to be modular so that it can be easily adapted to stationary or mobile NMs. The system uses commercial-off-the-shelf components and publicly-available software where possible. The software and hardware designs will be made freely available to the international NM community. The system is also designed for easy maintenance and calibration. It is affordable, shielded against electromagnetic interference and it makes the data available on the internet in real-time. The electronic system also features a fast acquisition system for pulse shape recording and microsecond accurate event timestamps. The pulse profiles are used for calibration and integrity testing to ensure long term stability. The accurate timestamps make multiplicity and time-of-arrival studies possible. Some first measurements with the new electronic system are presented and compared to previous systems. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).},

abstract={This paper describes and assesses a decentralized solution based on a wireless sensor-actuator network to provide primary frequency control from demand response in power systems with high wind energy penetration and, subsequently, with relevant frequency excursions. The proposed system is able to modify the electrical power demand of a variety of thermostatically-controlled loads, maintaining minimum comfort levels and minimizing both infrastructure requirements and primary reserves from the supply side. This low-cost hardware solution avoids any additional wiring, extending the wireless sensor-actuator network technology towards small customers, which account for over a 30% share of the current power demand. Frequency excursions are collected by each individual load controller, considering not only the magnitude of the frequency deviation, but also their evolution over time. Based on these time-frequency excursion characteristics, controllers are capable of modifying the power consumption of thermostatically-controlled loads by switching them off and on, thus contributing to primary frequency control in power systems with higher generation unit oscillations as a consequence of relevant wind power integration. Field tests have been carried out in a laboratory environment to assess the load controller performance, as well as to evaluate the electrical and thermal response of individual loads under frequency deviations. These frequency deviations are estimated from power systems with a high penetration of wind energy, which are more sensitive to frequency oscillations and where demand response can significantly contribute to mitigate these frequency excursions. The results, also included in the paper, evaluate the suitability of the proposed load controllers and their suitability to decrease frequency excursions from the demand side in a decentralized manner. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI.},

abstract={Purpose: Smart eyewear, such as augmented or virtual reality headset, allows the projection of virtual content through a display worn on the user’s head. This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named “CARTON”, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch. Design/methodology/approach: User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON’s hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities. Findings: Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task. Originality/value: The authors describe a novel way to create a smart eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to accelerate research around it. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Two new, simple, and specific green analytical methods are proposed: zero-crossing first-derivative and chemometric-based spectrophotometric artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed methods were used for the simultaneous estimation of two closely related antioxidant nutraceuticals, coenzyme Q10 (Q10) and vitamin E, in their mixtures and pharmaceutical preparations. The first method is based on the handling of spectrophotometric data with the first-derivative technique, in which both nutraceuticals were determined in ethanol, each at the zero crossing of the other. The amplitudes of the first-derivative spectra for Q10 and vitamin E were recorded at 285 and 235 nm respectively, and correlated with their concentrations. The linearity ranges of Q10 and vitamin E were 10-60 and 5.6-70 μg·mL-1, respectively. The second method, ANN, is a multivariate calibration method and it was developed and applied for the simultaneous determination of both analytes. A training set of 90 different synthetic mixtures containing Q10 and vitamin E in the ranges of 0-100 and 0-556 μg·mL-1, respectively, was prepared in ethanol. The absorption spectra of the training set were recorded in the spectral region of 230-300 nm. By relating the concentration sets (x-block) with their corresponding absorption data (y-block), gradient-descent back-propagation ANN calibration could be computed. To validate the proposed network, a set of 45 synthetic mixtures of the two drugs was used. Both proposed methods were successfully applied for the assay of Q10 and vitamin E in their laboratory-prepared mixtures and in their pharmaceutical tablets with excellent recovery. These methods offer advantages over other methods because of low-cost equipment, time-saving measures, and environmentally friendly materials. In addition, no chemical separation prior to analysis was needed. The ANN method was superior to the derivative technique because ANN can determine both drugs under nonlinear experimental conditions. Consequently, ANN would be the method of choice in the routine analysis of Q10 and vitamin E tablets. No interference from common pharmaceutical additives was observed. Student's t-test and the F-test were used to compare the two methods. No significant difference was recorded. © 2017, AOAC International. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Biologically inspired vision systems, such as convolutional networks, have begun to rival humans in some vision tasks. A key difference between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot. The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper is focused in the inclusion of open software tools and standard hardware devices into advanced mobility AIDS. Its urgency is due to the incorporation need of the numerous advances in mobile robotics to the area of the Assistive Technologies, and more specifically in the field of the so called Intelligent Wheelchairs (IW). In this paper we propose a common core for IWs based both on an open robotic platform and an open and a well extended software for robotics (ROS 'Robotic Operating System'). Such an IW core has got a distributed architecture whose processing nodes are linked through a CAN standard bus, which connects the low level control functions based on low cost and highly portable Cortex platforms. This paper describes also the autonomous navigation algorithm developed for the Intelligent Wheelchair by using an Extended Kalman Filter. In the chosen approach the absolute position of the IW (a mobile robot) is estimated using sensor fusion which combines data from two of the sensory systems included in the described open platform: the dead-reckoning system and a visual system based on QR landmarks located on the ceiling. Within this context, the paper demonstrates the potential of the platform proposal in relation to the quick and easy incorporation of recent advances in mobile robotics. © 2016 IEEE.},

The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the proliferation of hand-held devices in recent years, wireless video streaming has become an extremely popular application. Internet video streaming to mobile devices, however, faces several challenges, such as unstable connections, long latency, and high jitter. Bitrate adaptive streaming and video transcoding are widely used to overcome such problems. However, there are still several shortcomings of these approaches. Bitrate adaptive streaming cannot provide fine-grained adaptation. Moreover, video transcoding is expensive and is hard to apply for live streaming. In this work, we propose to use a low-cost video transcoding solution running at the wireless edge, such as home WiFi Access Points (APs). Instead of having expensive server-based transcoding, we designed and implemented a real-time video transcoding solution on a low-cost hardware, Raspberry Pi. By running our transcoding solution at the wireless edge, it can provide more agile adaptation to sudden network dynamics and is able to incorporate clients' feedback quickly. Our transcoding solution is transparent, low-cost, and scalable. Thus it allows broad and quick deployment in home WiFi APs (and also in cellular base stations). The evaluations reveal that our system enhances the performance of video streaming compared with other bitrate adaptive solutions. It provides higher video bitrates (at least 2.1×) without causing video stall or rebuffering. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a low cost hardware decoder design and architecture that supports general string matching (SM) using both a primary reference buffer (PRB) and a secondary reference buffer (SRB). An SM decoding module mainly performs string copy operation. The SM decoding module can also support intra block copy and palette decoding because both are actually two special cases of general string copy. The proposed architecture has four pipeline stages. The theoretical lowest system clock frequency required to guarantee worst case string copy operation using single-port SRAM is lower than the video output pixel rate, which is the product of frame resolution and frame rate. The design uses four pieces of SRAMs with size of 24K bytes, 16.5K bytes, 4K bytes, and 3K bytes, respectively. The first one is specific to SM and the other three are shared by traditional hybrid decoding operations. The SM decoding module has 69.5K logic gate count and can achieve 60 fps real time SM decoding for 4K (4096 × 2160) video at 218 MHz working frequency. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Eye tracking methods are usually focused on obtaining the highest spatial precision as possible, locating the centre of the pupil and the point of gaze for a series of frames. However, for the analysis of eye movements such as saccades or fixations, the temporal precision needs to be optimised as well. The results should not only be precise, but also stable. Eye tracking using low-cost hardware such as webcams brings a new series of challenges that have to be specifically taken into account. Noise, low resolution and low frame rates are some of these challenges, which in the end are the cause of temporal instabilities that negatively affect the results. This paper proposes a measure for temporal stability of pupil detection algorithms, applied on video streams obtained from webcams. The aim of this metric is to compare and evaluate the temporal stability of different algorithms (following a multi-layered approach for pupil detection), in order to identify which one is more adequate to its use for movement detection using low-cost hardware. The obtained results show how the temporal stability of different algorithms is affected by several factors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Although theoretically the patent system is meant to bolster innovation, the current United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is cumbersome and involves a significant time investment to locate inactive patents less than 20 years old. This article reports on the development of an open source database to find these public domain ideas. First, a search strategy is explained. Then the operation and use of free and open source software are detailed to meet the needs of open hardware innovators. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach with 3-D printing. The results showed how the Free Inactive Patent Search enables users to search using plain language text to find public domain concepts and then provides a hyperlinked list of ideas that takes users to the USPTO database for the patent for more information. All of the source code to operate the search and the website are open source themselves and provided in the public domain for free. In the case study on 3-D printing the time to identify public domain patents was cut by a factor of more than 1500.

abstract={An in-house solution for the verification of dose delivered to a moving phantom as required for the clinical implementation of lung stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy was developed. The superior–inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno™, a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS™ anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique. © 2016, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.},

abstract={Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

abstract={Switching common-mode voltage (CMV) generated by the pulse width modulation (PWM) of the inverter causes common-mode currents, which lead to motor bearing failures and electromagnetic interference problems in multiphase drives. Such switching CMV can be reduced by taking advantage of the switching states of multilevel multiphase inverters that produce zero CMV. Specific space-vector PWM (SVPWM) techniques with CMV elimination, which only use zero CMV states, have been proposed for three-level five-phase drives, and for open-end winding five-, six-, and seven-phase drives, but such methods cannot be extended to a higher number of levels or phases. This paper presents a general (for any number of levels and phases) SVPMW with CMV elimination. The proposed technique can be applied to most multilevel topologies, has low computational complexity and is suitable for low-cost hardware implementations. The new algorithm is implemented in a low-cost field-programmable gate array and it is successfully tested in the laboratory using a five-level five-phase motor drive. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes an implementation of a highly scalable parallel computational facility with high speedup efficiency using relatively low-cost hardware, which consists of a cluster of desktop personal computers (PCs) connected via a 10-Gigabit Ethernet. Two-levels of parallelization were implemented. Communication between different PCs was achieved using message passing interface (MPI) protocol. Domain decomposition was automated and based on element numbering. Domain continuity was assured largely by re-numbering the elements using a “front squasher” code prior to decomposition. Within each PC, the shared memory parallelization was implemented using either the open-multiprocessing (OpenMP) or the MPI protocol. Analysis of three different problems with number of degrees-of-freedom ranging from about 129,000 to about 2,260,000 shows a speedup efficiency generally above 70%. Super-linear speedup was achieved in several of the cases examined in this study, with the hybrid MPI-OpenMP approach generally performing better compared to the pure MPI method for parallelization. The results demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring a parallel computing facility with relatively modest outlay that is within the reach of consulting or engineering offices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Noise propagating through open windows raises one major concern of livability in metropolises, where residential buildings and arterial roads are densely constructed. Active noise control (ANC) is a possible technique to improve the current situation. Usually, ANC systems adopt the closed-loop control, where the quietness after control is continuously monitored by error microphones. However, ANC systems that attenuate noise propagating through open windows should ideally avoid the use of error microphones for the ease of implementation and maintenance. Furthermore, as open windows are commonly larger than the wavelength of the incident noise, multichannel ANC systems are necessary. Therefore, they result in computational burdens that cannot be handled by low-cost hardware platforms. This paper formulates the ANC system for open windows as a spatial sampling and reconstruction problem, and demonstrates that controlling noise propagating through open windows leads to global reduction of noise levels in the room. Both centralized and decentralized open-loop control filters are feasible in dealing with broad-band noise frequencies. © 2017 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={In this paper we propose an on-line system that discovers and drives collision-free traversable paths, using a variational approach to dense stereo vision. Our system is light weight, can be run on low cost hardware and is remarkably quick to predict the semantics. In addition to the scene's path affordance it yields a segmentation of the local scene as a composite of distinctive labels - e.g, ground, sky, obstacles and vegetation. To estimate the labels, we combine a very fast and light weight (shallow) image classifier which considers informative feature channels derived from colour images and dense depth maps estimates. Unlike other approaches, we do not use local descriptors around pixel features. Instead, we encompass label-predicted probabilities with a variational approach for image segmentation. Akin to dense depth map estimation, we obtain semantically segmented images by means of convex regularisation. We show how our system can rapidly obtain the required semantics and paths at VGA resolution. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset support the robustness of our system to derive collision-free local routes. An accompanied video supports the robustness of the system at live execution in an outdoor experiment. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The growing availability of robotic platforms and open-source software presents a striking opportunity for the advancement of scientific instrumentation. Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features, photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans. A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing platform. Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch, yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct semi-supervised. Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer. Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a successful landing. In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor. Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate use or customization.

abstract={We present our experiences in implementing hardware-based attacks to subvert the results of an election system. The election system was outlined by the Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) Embedded Security Challenge (ESC) competition in 2015, held at the New York University (NYU). The system had multiple layers of security and primarily used homomorphic encryption. The competition presented a challenge to hack the election system such that a preferred candidate wins the election. We cryptanalyzed the given election system to evaluate the effectiveness of various theoretical and practical attacks, and used a custom designed embedded system to demonstrate our attacks. The embedded system was implemented on a Nexys 4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA board. Our work, which earned the first place in the competition, demonstrates that low-cost hardware-based attacks can indeed lead to catastrophic consequences. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Neurons in the human brain continuously generate the various types of Brainwave frequencies which are known as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Theta waves. The proposed research is intended to find out the implications and effects of various external parameters using a customized framework by using well known methods after studying brainwave responses to various parameters of environment. There are continuously varying changes in human brain waves known as affective and cognitive responses. There are brain wave measuring devices available which measures EEG but they are proprietary and come in a big system widely used by medical professionals. These devices are very much expensive too and don't provide raw data access which can be utilized for later processing. The EEG data can be ported too on mobile phones and there are references found by which it has been ported to open source mobile phones for brain mapping. Many communication technologies have been developed in past years but development of communication systems for physically disabled people is the need of the day. As per the UNESCO's policy for Education for all, every human has right to learn and learning can only be possible for the disabled if a person is able to communicate. m-Sense (mobile Sense) is basically a mobile application with a low cost hardware which measures brainwave parameters and takes necessary actions based on the developed embedded algorithms. There has been continuous effort in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) in the past few years and now this is the time to give a little shift to this technology to integrate brain with mobile devices. m-Sense is basically an Android based mobile application which connects to the EEG Sensor TGAM Chip B3 (cube) Band which is product of Neuro-Bridge, Japan having one dry EEG sensor with quite good form factor and Bluetooth data connectivity powered by small battery. A user with disability can wear the EEG headset and once connected with the mobile device he/she can perform various basic tasks of making a voice call or sending a text message. The mobile application can be configured with auto passkey for the B3 Band Bluetooth address and can be connected easily wherein a user can also see the actions being taken on the mobile device. The user can make a call by just changing the brain wave level for attention or meditation and based on the preloaded encoding algorithm in the mobile application various alphabets or digits can be generated. Details for the same are discussed in first part of this paper. People with disabilities can also control various home appliances or can change TV channels with B3 Band if it is connected with Bluetooth enable Arduino open source platform having controlling relays. This is discussed in the later part of the paper. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Although functionalities of the brain are mostly explained using nerve cells and synapses, but there are a larger number of other types of cells providing support and protection for neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Among a variety of these non-neuronal cells, astrocytes are the most abundant cell types which act as supportive cells in the brain. The important role of astrocyte such as extracellular regulation, synaptic information regulation, neuronal synchronization and feedback to neural activity, make the astrocytes play a vital role for interacting with neurons in the brain. On the other hand, astrocytes provide feedback to neurons for modulating their neuronal activity. This paper presents a set of equation as a model to describe the mechanisms of neural glial interactions which are implementable on digital platforms. The proposed model can be utilized in large scale VLSI implementation of the biological neural networks, i.e. neuromorphic systems. Simulation results show that the model can precisely reproduce different behavior of neural glial interactions. The proposed model is investigated in terms of digital implementation feasibility and costs while targeting low-cost hardware realization. Hardware synthesis and physical realization on FPGA shows that the proposed model can reproduce different pathway behavior in neural glial mechanisms with higher performance and lower implementation cost compared with the original model. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Indeed, the control of flows in real time contributes to the efficient management of energy and enables consumers to identify their energy-intensive appliances and, subsequently, to change their consumption practices. However, the large-scaled deployment of intelligent measurement systems will require huge investments, which will directly affect the final consumer. This paper presents the design, implementation and realization of an intelligent electricity meter. This counter is based on low cost, open hardware and software structures. It is intended to monitor, manage and control a photovoltaic water pumping station.

The R wave is normally the easiest waveform to identify on the ECG. The R wave is also the component with the highest amplitude and its detection allows the estimation of the heart rate. This paper is devoted to present the design of a digital filter implemented on an open hardware platform called Arduino to detect the R wave of the ECG signal. The filter design is based on the integration of a smooth filter and the first order derivative. The implemented digital filter has been tested using different ECG signals generated by a patient simulator.

The advanced control strategies when applied into BLDC motor drive systems may further enhance their performance. However, these methods are relatively complex and computationally intensive, which may hamper the implementation. Fuzzy logic control algorithm has been developed in this investigation and embedded into a commercially available motion control system for the position control of BLDC motors. BLDC motor drives offered by PicoMotion Inc. and Motion Control Framework software platform have been selected for the experiments due to their compactness, flexibility and the open hardware and software concept they have been created upon. The obtained comparative results with respect to the built in PI control law have confirmed that the implementation of more advanced control strategies on inexpensive hardware and software platforms, nowadays available on the market for the control of BLDC motors, can be practically feasible and can enhance their performance. © 2016 IEEE.},

Currently IEEE802.15.4-2015 TSCH provides reliability over low-power wireless technologies and the IETF has defined a protocol stack that is suitable to constrained devices. Open-source initiatives contributing to the development of network stacks for embedded devices, and the availability of open hardware platforms that facilitate prototyping IIoT applications contributes to the adoption of IIoT technologies. To realize the IIoT vision, this demo presents the Open- WSN and OpenMote projects, which provide both an opensource software implementation of the IEEE low-power wireless technologies and the IETF protocol stack, and an open-source hardware platform that meets the requirements to prototype IIoT applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments. © The Author(s) 2016.},

In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the "Arduino" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

Automated regulation of pressure or flux through a membrane is required to minimize membrane fouling, thus maximizing efficiency and lifespan. Myriad automation tools exist, ranging from single purpose-built solutions to numerous linked sensors and hardware controls, all analyzed and controlled though commercially-available proprietary hardware and software. This paper outlines a way to design control systems for membrane-based filtration that utilize open source hardware and software, increasing the flexibility of a system to changing performance requirements while simultaneously minimizing the expense in time and resources to implement the control scheme. The method presented here can reduce the capital requirement for system control by one to two orders of magnitude while enhancing flexibility for system expansion and process sharing. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

To this end, we study the power allocation (PA) problem in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access system, when the served user equipment (UE) suffers from different levels of IQI. Additionally, we present a novel low-complexity solution with directly calculated PA policies, given the Lagrange multiplier, which mitigates the impact of IQI and achieves fairness in terms of capacity for the served UE, by maximizing the minimum achievable capacity of the UE. The effectiveness of the offered solution is validated through simulation results, which reveal that it can drastically increase the minimum achievable UE's capacity. © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Microbial water quality monitoring for the presence of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) is a mandatory activity in many countries and is key in public health protection. Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0 × 102 to 5.0 × 105 CFU ml−1 22–54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between β-glucuronidase and β-galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E. coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9 h compared with 13.5 h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E. coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel. © 2016 The Authors.

However, it has been demonstrated that radio frequency (RF) impairments such as amplifier nonlinearities, phase noise, and in-Phase/quadrature-Phase imbalances (IQI) can lead to severe degradation of the performance of such systems. Motivated by this, the present work is devoted to the quantification and evaluation of the effects of RF IQI on wireless communications in the context of cascaded fading channels for both single-Carrier and multicarrier systems. To this end, closed-form expressions are first derived for the outage probability (OP) over $N^{\ast}$ Nakagami-$m$ channels for the cases of ideal transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), ideal TX and IQI RX, IQI TX and ideal RX, and joint TX/RX IQI. The offered expressions, along with several deduced corresponding special cases, are subsequently employed in vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communications to justify their importance and practical usefulness in the context of emerging communication systems. The offered analytic results are corroborated by extensive comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. It is shown that considering non-Ideal RF front-Ends at the TX and/or RX introduces nonnegligible errors in the OP performance that can exceed 20% under several communication scenarios. It is further demonstrated that the effects by cascaded multipath fading conditions are particularly detrimental as they typically result in considerable performance losses of around or over an order of magnitude. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Open-source technology not only has facilitated the expansion of the greater research community, but by lowering costs it has encouraged innovation and customizable design. The field of automated microscopy has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 μm at the maximum speed and 27 μm at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3–9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world. © 2016 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2016 Royal Microscopical Society},

abstract={Sensory motor training programs are used in the rehabilitation and prevention of injuries among soccer players. Inconsistencies are found in the literature regarding the duration of the protocols and the exercises and equipment used. Objective To evaluate the benefits of a five-week sensory motor training program on the functional performance and postural control of young soccer players. Methods The study sample comprised 22 young male soccer players who were evaluated using: the Figure-of-Eight Test (F8), Side Hop Test (SHT), Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and a force platform. The players were randomly divided into a control group (N = 10), who continued their soccer practice sessions and an intervention group (N = 12), who continued their soccer practice sessions and were also enrolled in a supervised five-week sensory motor training program. Results After the five-week training program, the intervention group obtained significant results in the F8, SHT and SEBT, as well as in the following parameters: area of pressure of sway center (COP), mean velocity and mean frequency of COP. Conclusion The five-week sensory motor training program, carried out with easily available and low cost equipment, was effective at improving functional performance and postural control in young soccer players. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To reduce the wastage of electric power and electrical fires that are caused by the negligence of the elderly, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted relay control system in social networking environments. The proposed system comprises a power strip; three relays for the power strip control; an open hardware platform with light, temperature, and humidity sensors; and a camera module. In particular, it can support IP-based wireless connectivity and social networking through the Telegram Bot communicate with the elderly and their authorized persons such as family, a nurse, or a social worker. The user will receive the information from the proposed system, such as on/off states of the power strip, a type of devices connected to the power strip, and current measurement values from them, through a Telegram application on a smartphone. After checking the on/off states, the type of devices, and current measurement values, the user can decide which relays need to be controlled and send text messages with the indices of the specific relays and corresponding commands to the proposed system. Furthermore, to receive any alert messages for power saving and accident prevention, we can change the reference values for the sensors. Some experimental results verify that the proposed system can control on/off operation of the three relays, provide alert message services, and check the status of the power strip. © 2016 International Information Institute.},

abstract={There are currently no standardized objective measures to assess beer quality based on the most significant parameters related to the first impression from consumers, which are visual characteristics of foamability, beer color and bubble size. This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino® boards, Lego® building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied. © 2016},

abstract={Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters—photosystem II quantum yield (ΦII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others— and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment. © 2016 The Authors.},

We developed a complete hardware/software data acquisition and processing chain that automatically acquires, stores and co-registers images. The system was installed in September 2013 to monitor the evolution of the Planpincieux glacier, within the open-air laboratory of the Grandes Jorasses, Mont Blanc massif (NW Italy), and collected data with an hourly frequency. The acquisition equipment consists of a high-resolution DSLR camera operating in the visible band. The data are processed with a Pixel Offset algorithm based on normalized cross-correlation, to estimate the deformation of the observed glacier. We propose a method for the pixel-to-metric conversion and present the results of the projection on the mean slope of the glacier. The method performances are compared with measurements obtained by GB-SAR, and exhibit good agreement. The system provides good support for the analysis of the glacier evolution and allows the creation of daily displacement maps. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a low cost hardware support for on-chip message passing mechanism in manycore processors. Data sharing is an important problem for manycore processor. As the scale of manycore processors increases, the penalty of multicasts from cache coherence protocol increases dramatically, which restricts the performance of on-chip communications. In order to improve the performance of inter-core communications, message passing is introduced into manycore processors. On-chip message passing buffers are designed to supply high performance message passing in manycore processors, which takes about 5.26% on-chip storage area. However, the utilization of on-chip storage is low due to the usage of lightweight cores in manycore processors, in which computing and data transmission will not work simultaneously. This paper proposes a message passing scheme via reusing the cache memories and logical circuits in state machine from original cache coherence protocols. With reusing of cache memories, only 0.01% overhead in hardware costs are required to gain the similar performance with original message passing design. And our design with the same hardware costs gains 11% improvements in overall performance. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is used in a wide range of biomaterial applications including microfluidics, cell culture substrates, flexible electronics, and medical devices. However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets. These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait analysis. © 2016},

abstract={Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics and imagining. This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a ‘pop-up’ flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or ‘pop-out’) angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems. © 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

abstract={In the era of rapid development of 'green energy' and storage devices, microgrids implemented in line with the concept of distributed generation can be an effective form of power management.

The article presents a flexible, configurable microgrid's resources control system, which executes the task of meeting the electricity demand of local households with regard to economic issues. The system developed by the authors varies from the typical solutions available on the market - each user integrates its resources with the microgrid for personal gain. A decentralized control structure using controllers located in each household, built on open code optimizers and low-cost hardware was developed. In order to minimize the chances of a failure, a solution redundant in the aspects of communication and hot standby control devices was developed. A configurable optimization task, which takes into account settlement system between participants, as well as the possible need for withdrawal of the device, e.g. due to damage was defined. A comprehensive verification was done, using simulations for the sample microgrid with different ways of generating and storing. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Delay optimization is a today's topic. Delay is an important quality of service (QoS) parameter. In this paper, we present a technique that uses IP-addresses to encode the way a packet passes through the network without using a lookup table as well as a hardware accelerator to use this encoded information. Using this method, the time a packet that is delayed in the router is decreased dramatically, and the time to calculate the routing information is predictable. We show in simulation that this lookup is possible in about 5, 6 ns.

abstract={This paper proposes a computationally efficient, novel and superior nonlinear controller to the existing trajectory and orientation (T&O) control problem of an omnidirectional robot (ODR). Here first, the position and orientation (pose) estimation of the robot were obtained utilizing kinematic relationships of the ODR and multi-sensor fusion techniques. Then, dynamic relationships of the robot were used to form its state-space representation. The nonlinear state-space representation (NLSSR) was linearized by identifying and controlling the nonlinearity causing states. Then that linearized NLSSR was utilized to derive a state feedback controller and a proportional derivative integral (PID) controller to carry out a T&O tracking task. Performances of both derived controllers were evaluated in the simulation level comparing with a standard nonlinear controller. From the two proposed controllers, the best-performing, state feedback-based controller was able to be successfully implemented on a low-cost hardware platform due to its computational efficiency.},

abstract={Direct-conversion radio transceivers can offer reprogrammable and low-cost hardware solutions for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio (CR) devices. However, they are susceptible to radio frequency (RF) impairments, such as in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance (IQI), which can significantly constrain the spectrum sensing capabilities. This paper is devoted to quantify and evaluate the effects of IQI in the context of spectrum sensing in FD CR systems, in which self-interference suppression (SIS) techniques are employed. Specifically, closed form expressions are derived for the false alarm and detection probabilities, under three different scenarios: imperfect SIS with joint transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) IQI, imperfect SIS and ideal TX/RX RF front-end, and perfect SIS and ideal TX/RX RF front-end. The derived analytical results are validated through extensive simulations, which reveal that IQI has a detrimental impact on the spectrum sensing performance of the FD CR transceiver, which brings significant losses in the spectrum utilization. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) currently see a strong increase in demand for various industrial applications like smart testing and production systems. Open frequency bands (e.g. 2.4 GHz) allow the use of commercial low-cost hardware, but need to be shared with other devices and systems, leading to interference and therefore transmission errors. Re-Transmitting damaged packages might eventually succeed, but at the costs of increased latency and additional energy consumption of the node. As minimizing energy consumption is paramount for self-owered WSN nodes, interference avoidance is highly desired. In this work a channel management procedure for WSNs is proposed which can react to dynamically changing interference scenarios. A short monitoring period is used to sample received signal strength indication values of a set of candidate frequency bands. An extensive measurement campaign is performed and six analysis methods are compared, and effects of applying the resulting choice of 'best' frequency bands to WSNs in an automotive testing environment are investigated. The best method allows a reduction of energy consumption of a node by about 15%. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We present the results of a feasibility study of an earthquake early warning system (EEWS) for the Campania region (southern Italy) using schools as specific targets. The study considered the seismogenic zones as sources of potential earthquakes for the area, the Italian accelerometric network as the recording network for seismic event occurrence, and the performances of the software platform PRESToPlus for data analysis and processing. We analyze the distribution of lead-times for all possible threatening seismic sources for each municipality in the region under study by extracting the lead-time value corresponding to the 5th, 10th and 25th percentiles of the distributions. We discuss the results for the 5th percentile in order to analyze the worst-case scenario: in the case of a single site, the lead-time is expected to be larger than this value in the 95 % of the cases. Since the population distribution in Campania is uneven and most of the people live nearby the coast, whilst the most destructive earthquakes occur along the Apennine chain, we can conclude that an efficient EEWS can allow most of the schools in the area to undertake some mitigating actions. The testing of the EEWS was carried out in the high school ITIS ‘E. Majorana’, located at Somma Vesuviana, about 80 km from the seismogenic Irpinia region. For this purpose, the Sentinel, an actuator made up of low-cost hardware (i.e., Arduino®), was developed in close cooperation with students and teachers of the school to receive alert messages from the PRESToPlus platform and warn the school users in case of a seismic event. The EEWS and the Sentinel were successfully tested during some blind drills performed during normal school activities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The system is controlled with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems.

abstract={The commercial data acquisition systems used for seismic exploration are usually expensive equipment. In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Cross-sectional analysis is one of the important areas for physical failure analysis. Focus Ion Beam (FIB) and mechanical polish sample preparation are commonly used and necessary techniques in the semiconductor industry and Failure Analysis (FA) Company (Wills and Perungulam, 2007). However, each technique has its own limitation. Mechanical polishing technique easily induces artifact by mechanical force, especially on advance technology node. FIB can eliminate mechanically damaged artifact, but have the limitation on cross-sectional view area. Another potential technique will be plasma FIB, it used very high milling current and fast milling speed (Hrnčíř et al., 2013). However, it comes with a very high cost and having the contamination issue. The contamination issue greatly affects the low kV Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging quality. In recent semiconductor industry FA, low kV SEM imaging is preferable, because high kV imaging will introduce delamination artifacts especially on organic material from packaged sample. In this paper, Fast Laser Deprocessing Techniques (FLDT) application is further enhanced on large area cross-sectional FA with fast cycle time and low-cost equipment. This is to prevent from mechanical damage. In short, the proposed FLDT is a cost-effective and quick way to deprocess a sample for defect identification in cross-sectional FA. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the “big data” acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

abstract={Direct-conversion radio transceivers can offer reprogrammable and low-cost hardware solutions for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio (CR) devices. However, they are susceptible to radio frequency (RF) impairments, such as in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance (IQI), which can significantly constrain the spectrum sensing capabilities. This paper is devoted to quantify and evaluate the effects of IQI in the context of spectrum sensing in FD CR systems, in which self-interference suppression (SIS) techniques are employed. Specifically, closed form expressions are derived for the false alarm and detection probabilities, under three different scenarios: imperfect SIS with joint transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) IQI, imperfect SIS and ideal TX/RX RF front-end, and perfect SIS and ideal TX/RX RF front-end. The derived analytical results are validated through extensive simulations, which reveal that IQI has a detrimental impact on the spectrum sensing performance of the FD CR transceiver, which brings significant losses in the spectrum utilization. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) currently see a strong increase in demand for various industrial applications like smart testing and production systems. Open frequency bands (e.g. 2.4 GHz) allow the use of commercial low-cost hardware, but need to be shared with other devices and systems, leading to interference and therefore transmission errors. Re-Transmitting damaged packages might eventually succeed, but at the costs of increased latency and additional energy consumption of the node. As minimizing energy consumption is paramount for self-powered WSN nodes, interference avoidance is highly desired. In this work a channel management procedure for WSNs is proposed which can react to dynamically changing interference scenarios. A short monitoring period is used to sample received signal strength indication values of a set of candidate frequency bands. An extensive measurement campaign is performed and six analysis methods are compared, and effects of applying the resulting choice of 'best' frequency bands to WSNs in an automotive testing environment are investigated. The best method allows a reduction of energy consumption of a node by about 15%. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor and Actuators Networks (WSANs) constitute one of the most challenging technologies with tremendous socio-economic impact for the next decade. Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.},

This 425-nm wavelength photometer is controlled by an 89C51 microcontroller chip. Glucose concentration detection experiments involving enzyme coupling reactions were carried out to verify the performance of the proposed system. Measurement errors for the system were between 3% and 4%, which can be further improved to less than 2%. The proposed LED photometer can be used by students in electronics classes to conduct biotechnological tests as part of their electrical and electronics vocational high school education. This can help them to explore the basic applications of biosensors and enhance their professional abilities in executing fundamental bioelectronics processes. Pretest and post-test assessments of students' knowledge of bioelectronics were conducted to determine the efficacy of the proposed system in enhancing students' knowledge. The LED photometer can be modified to test various samples in biochemistry and analytical chemistry, and it can also be applied to various fields such as electronics, chemical engineering, and biochemistry. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The maker movement has shown how off-the-shelf devices can be combined to perform operations that, until recently, required expensive specialized equipment. Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the "confinement gradients" approach. This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup. © 2016 Frot et al.

abstract={We introduce a novel biometric based on distinctive eye movement patterns. The biometric consists of 20 features that allow us to reliably distinguish users based on differences in these patterns. We leverage this distinguishing power along with the ability to gauge the users' task familiarity, that is, level of knowledge, to address insider threats. In a controlled experiment, we test how both time and task familiarity influence eye movements and feature stability, and how different subsets of features affect the classifier performance. These feature subsets can be used to tailor the eye movement biometric to different authentication methods and threat models. Our results show that eye movement biometrics support reliable and stable continuous authentication of users. We investigate different approaches in which an attacker could attempt to use inside knowledge to mimic the legitimate user. Our results show that while this advance knowledge is measurable, it does not increase the likelihood of successful impersonation. In order to determine the time stability of our features, we repeat the experiment twice within 2 weeks. The results indicate that we can reliably authenticate users over the entire period. We show that lower sampling rates provided by low-cost hardware pose a challenge, but that reliable authentication is possible even at the rate of 50Hz commonly available with consumer-level devices. In a second set of experiments, we evaluate how our authentication system performs across a variety of real-world tasks, including reading, writing, and web browsing. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our approach in detail and give practical insights on the use of this biometric in a real-world environment. 2016 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={As the company and its volume of stored products grow, errors in the products inventory checkpoint are quite common due to both human failures and the lack of additional resources. Costs also come from the need to control the inventory and the information of stored products, where companies often hire specialized professionals in products inventory and in gathering information to carry out this task. Once they are stored in a disorganized way. The system is a software for inventory control, focusing on Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) integrated into the Open Source Hardware board Radiuino, which offers great advantage because of the implementation cost. All of this resumes in a technology that is increasingly gaining share for being used in many technological areas. Based upon the information gathered, we developed a software using this technology to control the products in stock. In doing so, we monitor the ins and outs of the products flow, as well as addressing them in stock. This process facilitates the control, the maintenance and the dispatch of the internal products of the company. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), the development of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) arises different challenges. Two of the main issues are electromagnetic interference and the lifetime of WSN nodes. In this paper, we show and evaluate experimentally the relation between interference and energy consumption, which impacts the network lifetime. We present a platform based on commercially available low-cost hardware in order to evaluate the impact of electromagnetic interference in 2.4 GHz ISM band on energy consumption of WSN. The energy measurements are obtained separately from each electronic component in the node. Interference and energy measurements are conducted in an anechoic chamber and in an office-type lab environment. X-MAC protocol is chosen to manage the Radio Duty Cycle of the nodes and its energy performance is evaluated. The energy consumption transmitter nodes is analyzed particularly in this work. Moreover, this energy consumption has been quantified and differentiated according to the number of (re-)transmissions carried out by the transmitter as well as the number of ACK packets sent by the receiver for a single packet. Finally, we use a model of real battery to calculate the lifetime of the node for operation within different interference level zones. This study lays the basis for further design rules of communication protocols and development of WSNs. © 2016 IEEE.},

Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this article, a software-defined converged fixed-mobile 5G architecture is introduced using carrier-grade Ethernet as a transport platform. An active remote node (ARN) is used to connect end-users. Powered at a radio base station, the ARN aggregates the traffic of fixed and mobile radio users. Transport capacity is reduced due to statistical multiplexing, and scalability is achieved by a modular design. The ARN enables software-defined networking (SDN) via the open-networks-as-a-service (Open NaaS) control and management plane. Adopting the Open Access model, this architecture offers both, multi-technology and multi-operator features. Next generation fronthaul, resource sharing, synchronization, low latency can all be established as services to build an advanced 5G infrastructure. Key concepts of the new architecture have been realized using low-cost hardware and offer economic high-speed, fixed and mobile Internet. E.g., for wireless connectivity to macro- and small cells, mm-wave links reaching 5 Gb/s and short-range optical wireless links have been used. As data rates can be scaled up, the proposed architecture is considered future-proof for converged 5G fixed-mobile access networks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={After many struggles from disability rights and independent-living advocates, urban accessibility has gradually become a concern for many urban planners across post-industrial countries. In this paper, based on ethnographic fieldwork studies in Barcelona working with urban accessibility professionals and activists, we argue for the importance of the ‘documentation interfaces’ created in their struggles: that is, the relational processes to collaboratively build multi-media accounts in a diversity of formats seeking to enforce different translations of bodily needs into specific urban accessibility arrangements. In discussion with the asymmetries that the ongoing expertization of accessibility might be opening up, we would like to foreground these apparently irrelevant practices as an interesting site to reflect on how urban accessibility struggles might allow us to rethink the project of technical democracy and its applications to urban issues. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the creation of Streets for All, a platform to contest and to sensitize technicians and citizens alike of the problems of ‘shared streets’ for the blind and partially sighted led by the Catalan Association for the Blind; and (2) the organization of the Tinkerthon, a DIY and open-source hardware workshop boosted by En torno a la silla to facilitate the creation of a network of tinkerers seeking to self-manage accessibility infrastructures. These cases not only bring to the fore different takes on the democratization of the relations between technical professionals and disability rights advocates, but also offer different approaches to the politics of universals in the design of urban accessibility arrangements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a very simple beam steering system which can steer the axial beam of any arbitrarily-large circular array in 2 dimensions, using 3 hybrids and 3 or 4 variable phase shifters, depending on the variant of the method. It is particularly suited to mm-wave arrays for 5G backhaul links among small cells, where the nodes would typically be mounted on non-rigid platforms which would require a beam-alignment and tracking capability over some limited range in azimuth and elevation around the beam axis, to compensate for platform motions. By minimizing the number of expensive RF components irrespective of the array size, this technique also facilitates low cost hardware implementation which is particularly important for large-scale deployments in future 5G wireless networks. The method makes use of the axial radiation patterns of phase-modes, which are generated by an additional 4 hybrids and imposed on an arbitrary number of antenna elements by a simple 'pill-box' radial TEM waveguide feed structure. Phase modes have been used in past applications, but almost exclusively in the azimuthal plane of circular ring arrays, whereas the present technique employs their radiation patterns in the axial direction, orthogonal to the plane of the array. Higher-order phase modes differing in order by '1' may be similarly combined to increase the radial steering range, e.g. for mobile satellite antennas. An adaptive beam-tracking algorithm for such beam steerers is also formulated. Mathematical developments and simple system design illustrate the concept and some possible variations. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations at a scaled frequency in the 5 GHz band are presented to show its feasibility, and scalability to mm-wave or other wavelengths, and its applicability to filled circular arrays with circular polarizations. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Direct-conversion radio (DCR) receivers can offer highly integrated low-cost hardware solutions for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) systems. However, the DCR receivers are susceptible to radio frequency (RF) impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance, low-noise amplifier nonlinearities, and phase noise, which limit the spectrum sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the joint effects of RF impairments on energy detection-based spectrum sensing for CR systems in multi-channel environments. In particular, we provide the novel closed-form expressions for the evaluation of the detection and false alarm probabilities, assuming Rayleigh fading. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the case of CR networks with cooperative sensing, where the secondary users suffer from different levels of RF imperfections, considering both scenarios of error free and imperfect reporting channel. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the analysis as well as the detrimental effects of RF imperfections on the spectrum sensing performance, which bring significant losses in the spectrum utilization. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things promises an always-connected future where the objects surrounding us will communicate in order to make our lives easier, more secure, etc. This evolution is a research opportunity as new solutions must be found to problems ranging from network interconnection to data mining. In the networking community, innovative solutions are being developed for the Device Layer of the Internet of Things, which includes the IoT wireless protocols. In order to study their performance, researchers turn more often to real world platforms, commonly designated by the term testbeds, on which they may implement and test the protocols and algorithms. This is even more important in the Industrial IoT field, where environments are perturbed by industrial systems like automated production systems. In this paper, after a brief presentation of the context of testbeds, we introduce WiNo and OpenWiNo, an open hardware and software framework for fast-prototyping in the field of the Internet of Things. Compared to existing platforms, the solution WiNo+OpenWiNo offers a wide array of Physical layers and easy integration of various sensors as it is developed as part of the Arduino ecosystem. It also allows research teams to easily and quickly deploy their own testbed into real environments. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Direct-conversion architectures (DCA) can offer highly integrated low-cost hardware solutions to communication transceivers. However, DCA devices are sensitive to radio frequency (RF) imperfections such as amplifier non-linearities, phase noise and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalances (IQI), which typically lead to a severe degradation of the performance of such systems. Motivated by this, we quantify and evaluate the impact of RF IQI on wireless communications in the context of cascaded fading channels. Novel closed form expressions are derived for the corresponding outage probability for the case of ideal transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), ideal TX and I/Q imbalanced RX, I/Q imbalanced TX and ideal RX, and joint I/Q imbalanced TX/RX. The offered analytic results have a relatively convenient algebraic representation and their validity is extensively justified through simulations. Based on these, it is shown that cascaded fading leads to considerable degradation in the system performance and that assuming ideal RF front-ends at the TX and RX induces non-negligible errors in the outage probability that can exceed 20% in several communication scenarios. We further demonstrate that the effects by cascaded multipath fading conditions are particularly severe, as they typically result to considerable performance losses of around or over an order of magnitude. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) Demand Access System (DAS) sustainment is aimed at modernizing the existing DAS using low-cost hardware components as well as a more robust monitor and control architecture. A key part of the system is the DAS receiver, which supports the Pseudo Noise (PN) modulation waveforms of the TDRSS. The receiver in the current DAS system is a custom design that has been increasingly difficult to maintain, due to hardware obsolescence and a lack of sufficient inventory of spare units. In addition, the receivers suffer from performance issues, which tend to limit the customer base subscribing to the DAS service. The DAS sustainment effort attempts to rectify the performance shortfall of the current receiver and address hardware obsolescence by making software portability a key design goal. As part of the DAS sustainment effort, two low-cost receivers were developed: one of them based on a commercial spread-spectrum receiver implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and the other a Software Defined Radio (SDR) implemented on a server class computer. The two receiver prototypes underwent extensive testing in a laboratory environment as well as on-air testing with orbiting customers. Receiver design details and test results are presented. The potential usages of such TDRSS compatible, low cost and small footprint of receivers in CubeSat are discussed. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Introducing new communication equipment or system to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) ground segment is a complicated process that involves a lengthy development and test cycle. Complexity arises due to the presence of the variety of signaling formats, operation and user constraints, monitor and control parameters, and the requirement to ensure the new piece of ground equipment or system meets the functional and performance requirements for all different combinations of system configuration parameters and operational scenarios. The development cycle starts with extensive software simulations to establish the performance parameters of the new equipment or system followed by a prototyping stage. The prototype system undergoes a battery of tests in a laboratory environment to verify that it is capable of meeting the performance levels derived from the software simulations. Testing must be performed using simulated signals generated either using software or hardware. The current practice is to use a chain of test equipment, each piece in the chain dedicated to a single function. This requires manual setup between different test configurations and test reporting is also handled manually. This is costly both in terms of test hardware investment and the manpower involved. The options available to reduce the cost are to use either a software or hardware simulator that can combine multiple functions in a single unit. Software simulation involves generating signal files that can be played back repeatedly. Depending on the data rate being simulated, each test file can occupy several Terabytes (TBs); in addition, it requires a playback system which tends to be relatively expensive to acquire and maintain. On the other hand, with more advanced signal processing technology the hardware simulation can be achieved with low cost Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). A low cost hardware simulator that can support data rates up to 25 Mbps is selected for the simulation system. The simulator supports baseband digital data formats and different modulation and coding schemes used in the TDRSS. Channel impairments applicable for communicating with orbiting platforms and signal impairments generated by the TDRSS itself are also simulated by the system; these include stressing profiles of delay, Doppler, and multipath. Hardware distortions of customer platforms are simulated by a set of software defined distortion filters designed according to the user constraints specified in the Space Network user's guide. In order to reduce the time spent during the prototype testing phase, an automated test system is being developed. Simulator architecture and the test automation approach will be presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advent of open source hardware and software, students are able to perform advanced microelectronic experiments outside of the laboratory setting using low-cost components and equipment. Offering experiments outside of a traditional lab accommodates distance-learning as well as large class sizes. Many authors have addressed comparisons of in-lab laboratories with ones completed virtually or remotely,1,2 however much less has been studied regarding the use of actual, physical laboratories by students at home or in their dormitory rooms outside of the traditional laboratory.3,4 To respond to and leverage technological advancements in portable test and measurement equipment, several student-accessible electronics hardware platforms were considered including the NI myDAQ, Arduino development board, TI LaunchPad, BitScope, Analog Discovery, and a Creative Soundblaster USB Audio System. Ultimately, an initial pilot study with 14 students was conducted in a summer microelectronics course using the NI myDAQ. This, along with high-quality instructional videos, allowed students to complete experiments on their own outside of the laboratory setting. In this study, two of the later course hardware exercises - multi-stage amplifier and op-amp amplifier - were offered to half of the class as labs to be completed outside of the traditional laboratory. Independent validation of the experiment using randomized, multi-stage testing was performed and its effectiveness queried using in-person laboratory observations, instructor discussions, a post-laboratory survey, and student laboratory report assessment. Recommendations for implementing out-of-lab student experiments include anticipating hardware failure, encouraging student collaboration, and providing live TA assistance. As a result of the pilot work, additional laboratory offerings using these recommendations as well as explored alternative hardware solutions are being pursued. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.},

abstract={From the early days, images are being generally accepted as a proof of occurrence of the past events. The availability of low cost hardware and software tools, makes easy to create and manipulate digital images with no obvious traces. This has led to the situation where one can no longer take the integrity and authenticity of the digital images for granted. In many cases, the images are copied from one image to another image to form the composite image called splicing. This is done by various image editing softwares like photoshop, GIMP etc. So, the spliced images are under scan and need to be tested for its authenticity. In this regard, image feature extraction based classifiers like K Nearest Neigbor(KNN), Fuzzy Logic and Support Vector Machine(SVM) are used for identification of spliced images. In the first step, features are extracted from the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The extracted features are fed to the KNN, Fuzzy and SVM classifiers. Based on the Accuracy parameter obtained from each of the classifier, the comparative analysis of the classifiers is performed. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Companies producing consumer products have begun working on ways to control their products over the IP (Internet Protocol). The main feature provided by the already-existing home automation systems is that, every piece of equipment integrated is to be controlled by a central control system unit. Centralized solution based on this idea are very expensive, difficult to configure and more prone to problems because if the central control unit fails then every device becomes out of control. IP based systems are supposed to be simpler and easier to manipulate, with the only necessity being, connected to the network, Ethernet or Wi-Fi. With this in mind, we designed a low cost hardware and its requisite software framework based on distributed control system for home/commercial automation, in which every device would be connected with an electronic chip capable of communicating over the IP network and also being able to control the state of device, which includes switching and change in the device intensity. Furthermore additional circuitry has been added to turn on or off the device after certain period of user defined time. The beauty of this technique is that each device is its own control system and gets commands from the user via smart phone or even a web browser, if one device goes down then it doesn't affect the functioning of the rest of the devices. This paper seeks to pave the way for IP-enabling home appliances, making such devices part of well-known field the Internet of Things. Enabling each of these devices with capability of communicating over the network eliminates the need for special internet connected control units, and thus simplifying home automation. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cervical spinal cord injury can disrupt connections between the brain respiratory network and the respiratory muscles which can lead to partial or complete loss of ventilatory control and require ventilatory assistance. Unlike current open-loop technology, a closed-loop diaphragmatic pacing system could overcome the drawbacks of manual titration as well as respond to changing ventilation requirements. We present an original bio-inspired assistive technology for real-time ventilation assistance, implemented in a digital configurable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The bio-inspired controller, which is a spiking neural network (SNN) inspired by the medullary respiratory network, is as robust as a classic controller while having a flexible, low-power and low-cost hardware design. The system was simulated in MATLAB with FPGA-specific constraints and tested with a computational model of rat breathing; the model reproduced experimentally collected respiratory data in eupneic animals. The open-loop version of the bio-inspired controller was implemented on the FPGA. Electrical test bench characterizations confirmed the system functionality. Open and closed-loop paradigm simulations were simulated to test the FPGA system real-time behavior using the rat computational model. The closed-loop system monitors breathing and changes in respiratory demands to drive diaphragmatic stimulation. The simulated results inform future acute animal experiments and constitute the first step toward the development of a neuromorphic, adaptive, compact, low-power, implantable device. The bio-inspired hardware design optimizes the FPGA resource and time costs while harnessing the computational power of spike-based neuromorphic hardware. Its real-time feature makes it suitable for in vivo applications. © 2016 Zbrzeski, Bornat, Hillen, Siu, Abbas, Jung and Renaud.},

abstract={This paper presents prototype implementation of low-cost, open hardware, static-gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU)-consisting of a pair of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors, a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed, the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to enhance the system efficiency from 83.1% to 94.5% without any additional hardware. The cost of the system is USD 30, which the authors believe on commercialization, could be brought under USD 9. © 2016 IEEE.},

The single PN scheme uses the correlation of a local PN sequence and the received PN signal to estimate the ToA. The DPN scheme utilizes the cross correlation of the two received PN segments in one signal frame to calculate the ToA. Both simulation and field test results show that the DPN design outperforms the single PN scheme, as the DPN scheme is robust to the severe underwater acoustic channel dispersion and the high carrier frequency offset (CFO) in low-cost hardware systems where the atomic clock is unavailable. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Real-time high-resolution (including super-resolution) imaging with low-cost hardware is a long sought-after goal in various imaging applications. Here, we propose broadband single-shot and single-sensor high-/super-resolution imaging by using a spatio-temporal dispersive metasurface and an imaging reconstruction algorithm. The metasurface with spatio-temporal dispersive property ensures the feasibility of the single-shot and single-sensor imager for super- and high-resolution imaging, since it can convert efficiently the detailed spatial information of the probed object into one-dimensional time- or frequency-dependent signal acquired by a single sensor fixed in the far-field region. The imaging quality can be improved by applying a feature-enhanced reconstruction algorithm in post-processing, and the desired imaging resolution is related to the distance between the object and metasurface. When the object is placed in the vicinity of the metasurface, the super-resolution imaging can be realized. The proposed imaging methodology provides a unique means to perform real-time data acquisition, high-/super-resolution images without employing expensive hardware (e.g. mechanical scanner, antenna array, etc.). We expect that this methodology could make potential breakthroughs in the areas of microwave, terahertz, optical, and even ultrasound imaging.},

The SEcube™ platform provides several functional entry levels, ranging from the hardware to software APIs amenable to become service-ready in a near future. This way, developers who do not feel comfortable on security aspects can use the easy-to-use API abstraction layer and experience the Cube as a high-security black box.

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study is to present the development of a new technique to obtain 3D models using photogrammetry by a mobile device and free software, as a method for making digital facial impressions of patients with maxillofacial defects for the final purpose of 3D printing of facial prostheses. Methods: With the use of a mobile device, free software and a photo capture protocol, 2D captures of the anatomy of a patient with a facial defect were transformed into a 3D model. The resultant digital models were evaluated for visual and technical integrity. The technical process and resultant models were described and analyzed for technical and clinical usability. Results: Generating 3D models to make digital face impressions was possible by the use of photogrammetry with photos taken by a mobile device. The facial anatomy of the patient was reproduced by a∗.3dp and a∗.stl file with no major irregularities. 3D printing was possible. Conclusions: An alternative method for capturing facial anatomy is possible using a mobile device for the purpose of obtaining and designing 3D models for facial rehabilitation. Further studies must be realized to compare 3D modeling among different techniques and systems. Clinical implication: Free software and low cost equipment could be a feasible solution to obtain 3D models for making digital face impressions for maxillofacial prostheses, improving access for clinical centers that do not have high cost technology considered as a prior acquisition. © 2016 Salazar-Gamarra et al.},

abstract={As integrated circuits become increasingly complex, the fabrication process renders them more marginal to specification parameters. Consequently, these circuits have to be tuned post fabrication to compensate for process marginality and thereby optimize their performance as well as to improve yields. This process of tuning is commonly termed as trimming, wherein the right set of digital trim codes is identified and used as a calibration setting by writing these codes into the hardware configuration registers. This paper addresses the problem of carrying out multi-variable trims involving two or more parameters, codes for which must be simultaneously searched and set, in order to attain the desired performance of the circuit. A novel low-cost hardware implementation of the Simplex minimization algorithm with speed-up improvements is described. This implementation is amenable for on-chip BIST (built-in self-test) and can also be directly implemented as part of the ATE (automatic test equipment) program. Experimental results are presented on two industrial circuits. Improvements in terms of trim code search time and attaining better performance are shown. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational activities is an open research issue. It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (JJ Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, a new open hardware interface based on Arduino to read electromotive force (emf) from potentiometric detectors is presented. The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)-based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA+-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA+ content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The efficient modeling, simulation, and implementation of biological neural networks are key objectives of the neuromorphic research field, leading to potential applications, such as assisting the search for new solutions to cure brain diseases, improved performance of robots, and the fundamental study of neural network behavior. This brief proposes a modified biological Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron model that is more suited for efficient implementation on digital platforms. Simulation results show that the model can reproduce the desired behaviors of the neuron. The proposed model is investigated, in terms of digital implementation feasibility and cost, targeting a low-cost hardware implementation. Hardware implementation on a field-programmable gate array shows that the modified model mimics the biological behavior of different types of neurons, with higher performance and considerably lower hardware overhead cost compared with the original HR model. © 2015 IEEE.},

With this initiative, lab resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Araranguá/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi.

abstract={In this paper, we show that cache partitioning does not necessarily ensure predictable cache performance in modern COTS multicore platforms that use non-blocking caches to exploit memory- level-parallelism (MLP). Through carefully designed experiments using three real COTS multicore platforms (four distinct CPU architectures) and a cycle- accurate full system simulator, we show that special hardware registers in non-blocking caches, known as Miss Status Holding Registers (MSHRs), which track the status of outstanding cache-misses, can be a significant source of contention; we observe up to 21X WCET increase in a real COTS multicore platform due to MSHR contention. We propose a hardware and system software (OS) collaborative approach to efficiently eliminate MSHR contention for multicore real-time systems. Our approach includes a low-cost hardware extension that enables dynamic control of per-core MLP by the OS. Using the hardware extension, the OS scheduler then globally controls each core's MLP in such a way that eliminates MSHR contention and maximizes overall throughput of the system. We implement the hardware extension in a cycle- accurate fullsystem simulator and the scheduler modification in Linux 3.14 kernel. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using a set of synthetic and macro benchmarks. In a case study, we achieve up to 19% WCET reduction (average: 13%) for a set of EEMBC benchmarks compared to a baseline cache partitioning setup. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The availability of free and open source hardware designs that can be replicated with low-cost 3D printers provides large values to scientists who need highly-customized low-volume production scientific equipment. Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science. © The Author 2015.},

abstract={The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

abstract={OpenPET is an open source, modular, extendible, and high-performance platform suitable for multi-channel data acquisition and analysis. Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Open reduction internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures is often accomplished with proximal humerus locking plates. While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by previous screw holes. © 2016 Arthroscopy Association of North America.},

abstract={Due to the low cost of easy-to-use components of open-source hardware and software, the Internet of Things may be pervading through everything everywhere. The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Introduction: Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) has been shown to be efficacious for chronic tic disorders (CTDs), but utilization is limited by a lack of treatment providers and perceived financial and time burden of commuting to treatment. A promising alternative to in-person delivery is voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), allowing for remote, real-time treatment delivery to patients’ homes. However, little is known about the effectiveness of VoIP for CTDs. Therefore, the present study examined the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of VoIP-delivered CBIT (CBIT-VoIP). Methods: Twenty youth (8–16 years) with CTDs participated in a randomized, waitlist-controlled pilot trial of CBIT-VoIP. The main outcome was pre- to post-treatment change in clinician-rated tic severity (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale). The secondary outcome was clinical responder rate (Clinical Global Impressions – Improvement Scale), assessed using ratings of ‘very much improved’ or ‘much improved’ indicating positive treatment response. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses with the last observation carried forward were performed. At post-treatment (10-weeks), significantly greater reductions in clinician-rated, (F(1,18) = 3.05, p &lt; 0.05, partial η2= 0.15), and parent-reported tic severity, (F(1,18) = 6.37, p &lt; 0.05, partial η2= 0.26) were found in CBIT-VoIP relative to waitlist. One-third (n = 4) of those in CBIT-VoIP were considered treatment responders. Treatment satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were high. Discussion: CBIT can be delivered via VoIP with high patient satisfaction, using accessible, low-cost equipment. CBIT-VoIP was generally feasible to implement, with some audio and visual challenges. Modifications to enhance treatment delivery are suggested. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by different water quality related components (such as the presence of phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation Kd coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Tail-biting convolutional codes (TBCC) have been applied in many recent modern communication standards such as LTE and WIMAX. TBCC is a method applied in conventional convolutional code by replacing a fixed zero-tail with tail-biting data constrains to achieve a better coding efficiency. This modification makes the decoding process becomes much more complex. Due to impracticality of the optimum decoding algorithm such as brute force, recently some suboptimum algorithms have been developed but it still leaves a large amount of computation due to the iterative nature wherein the number of iterations depends on the received codeword causes inefficient system for implementation, especially for real time applications. In this paper we offer a new algorithm that is specific to low cost hardware implementation. Low cost criteria are addressed to minimum amount of computation for each decoding process. In addition to causing smaller area consumption, the lack of computing process will also make decoding processing time becomes faster. This algorithm that we call reverse trellis algorithm also offers a fixed amount of computation regardless to the received codeword, thus will not require extra memory consumption as it being on an implementation. Taking a case study on TBCC configuration for LTE, proposed algorithm requires 5712 adding operations and 3008 inverting operations. A significant decrease compared to 286736, adding 143360 inverting for Brute Force and 45079976738816 adding 1099511627776 inverting for all possible fixed tail ML decoder. In the performance of BER, reverse trellis algorithm is able to deliver improved by more than 1 dB compared to direct terminating ML decoder. © 2015 IEEE.},

The combination of the open source hardware and software system created a flexible and expandable platform for further developments in the future, both in the software and hardware areas, in particular in combination with graph database for artificial intelligence, as well as more sophisticated hardware, such as legged or humanoid robots. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Environmental data are critical to understanding environmental phenomena, yet their consistent collection and curation can be cost-prohibitive. This paper describes a recipe for the design, development, and deployment of a low-cost environmental data logging and transmission system for environmental sensors and its connection to an open source data-sharing network. The hardware is built using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system automatically ingests data into HydroServer, a standards-based server in the open source hydrologic information system (HIS) created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI). By publishing data in this way, they are discoverable through the geographic information system (GIS)-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. In addition, because they follow WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalog such as the global earth observation system of system catalog. A recipe for building the system is provided. Multiple deployments used to test proof-of-concept of the system are described and their results are given. Ease of deployment and reliability of the logging and transmission system is also addressed. © IWA Publishing 2016.},

abstract={The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={In this article, I explore the responses of the Open Source community to the Fukushima disaster by describing the development of collaborative technologies to measure radioactive contamination across Japan. Based on participant observation at Tokyo Hacker Space, this article addresses an emergent form of technoscientific expertise which is not confined to or legitimized by established institutions, but, rather, is distributed and organized around transnational networks of field specialists, companies, educational institutions, and volunteers. Both Tokyo Hacker Space, as an independent laboratory, and Safecast, as a spin-off project, advanced practices of hardware engineering and Open data management, which are examined in this article as manifestations of bricolage. As a concluding argument, I suggest that expertise and responsibility are interpretive keys for understanding the possibilities and impossibilities of collaboration and coordination in the context of Open Source-based responses to the Fukushima crisis. Responsibility has become an open question for Safecast and Tokyo Hacker Space, as both have championed "openness" as an ethical point of departure, a projected outcome, and a technical orientation in the context of the Fukushima disaster. © 2016 by the Institute for Ethnographic Research (IFER) a part of The George Washington University.

Several commercial hardware and software solutions for the realization of such monitoring measurements are available on the market.

The task of managing an open source project is well-known in computer science, but it is fairly new in a geodetic context. This paper contributes to that issue by detailing applications, frameworks, and interfaces for the design and implementation of open hardware and software solutions for sensor control, sensor networks, and data management in automatic deformation monitoring.

abstract={Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 × 8 × 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 μm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. © 2016 Author(s).},

abstract={The PCCR (Pupil Center Corneal Reflection) method became dominant for finding human's diverse eye gaze directions through the research on the eye tracking technology that has been done for a very long period of time. The initial studies on the eye tracking technology were related to the general human interface for operating equipment and devices, then it has been promoted to the field of various purposes such as a market research in a recent study analyzing customer's behaviors. In particular, a real time eye gaze tracking system is most important for many HCI applications including stereoscopic synthesis, intend extraction, behavior analysis and etc. In order to make an eye gaze tracking system to be real time, the system must have an efficient pupil detection algorithm and ambience-independent image processing as well as reduced complexity, small size and number of circuit components. This paper proposes a method for getting clean images compared to the previous systems to reduce image processing overhead. Because it also helps reducing the number of image frames to be dropped during the image processing, the proposed method can provide a sufficient performance even on a low cost hardware system by reducing the transmission traffic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Regenerative braking is an important technology in improving fuel economy of an electric vehicle (EV). However, additional motor braking will change the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle, leading to braking instability, especially when the anti-lock braking system (ABS) is triggered. In this paper, a novel semi-brake-by-wire system, without the use of a pedal simulator and fail-safe device, is proposed. In order to compensate for the hysteretic characteristics of the designed brake system while ensure braking reliability and fuel economy when the ABS is triggered, a novel switching compensation control strategy using sliding mode control is brought forward. The proposed strategy converts the complex coupling braking process into independent control of hydraulic braking and regenerative braking, through which a balance between braking performance, braking reliability, braking safety and fuel economy is achieved. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is effective and adaptable in different road conditions while the large wheel slip rate is triggered during a regenerative braking course. The research provides a new possibility of low-cost equipment and better control performance for the regenerative braking in the EV and the hybrid EV. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={Coral reefs hosts nearly 25% of all marine species and provide food sources for half a billion people worldwide while only a very small percentage have been surveyed. Advances in technology and processing along with affordable underwater cameras and Internet availability gives us the possibility to provide tools and softwares to survey entire coral reefs. Holistic ecological analyses of corals require not only the community view (10s to 100s of meters), but also the single colony analysis as well as corallite identification. As corals are three-dimensional, classical approaches to determine percent cover and structural complexity across spatial scales are inefficient, time-consuming and limited to experts. Here we propose an end-to-end approach to estimate these parameters using low-cost equipment (GoPro, Canon) and freeware (123D Catch, Meshmixer and Netfabb), allowing every community to participate in surveys and monitoring of their coral ecosystem.We demonstrate our approach on 9 species of underwater colonies in ranging size and morphology. 3D models of underwater colonies, fresh samples and bleached skeletons with high quality texture mapping and detailed topographic morphology were produced, and Surface Area and Volume measurements (parameters widely used for ecological and coral health studies) were calculated and analysed. Moreover, we integrated collected sample models with micro-photogrammetry models of individual corallites to aid identification and colony and polyp scale analysis. © 2016 Gutierrez-Heredia et al.

abstract={Over the last few years, there has been a decline in the students' interest towards Science and Optics. Use of technology in the form of various types of sensors and data acquisition systems has come as a saviour. Till date, manual routine tools and techniques are used to perform various experimental procedures in most of the science/optics laboratories in our country. The manual tools are cumbersome whereas the automated ones are costly. It does not enthuse young researchers towards the science laboratories. There is a need to develop applications which can be easily integrated, tailored at school and undergraduate level laboratories and are economical at the same time. Equipments with advanced technologies are available but they are uneconomical and have complicated working principle with a black box approach. The present work describes development of portable tools and applications which are user-friendly. This is being implemented using open-source physical computing platform based on a simple low cost microcontroller board and a development environment for writing software. The present paper reports the development of an automated spectrometer, an instrument used in almost all optics experiments at undergraduate level, and students' response to this innovation. These tools will inspire young researchers towards science and facilitate development of advance low cost equipments making life easier for Indian as well as developing nations.},

abstract={The Large Scale Antenna System is expected to bring significant improvements to overall Communication System Performance. However the use of so many antennas in Massive Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (Massive MIMO) architectures highlights the cost implication of the technology. It is therefore possible that Massive MIMO may be deployed using low cost equipment to avoid HUGE implementation costs. The use of Low Cost Equipment will results into significant Radio Frequency Impairments (RF-Impairments) such as Phase Noise, IQ Imbalance and Nonlinearities, which will affect the overall system performance. Among other aspects channel estimations will also be affected since the signal used for these estimations will be affected by the RF-Impairments. This paper analyzes a way to exploit correlation during Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Channel Estimation of a Massive MIMO System in presence of aggregated RF-Impairments (i.e. combined effects of the impairments). Specifically it derived the statistical distribution of the equivalent aggregated error/noise term using statistical identities and uses the derived term to obtain temporal channel estimation error and consequently the correlation matrix necessary to minimizes the channel Mean Square Error (MSE) of the channel estimate. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Electronic controller unit (ECU) used for controlling sub-systems of complex real life applications like automotive vehicles can pose several challenges. Many times one needs to plan development and testing of controller, when the end vehicle is also under development and hence not available. In such case, hardware in the loop (HIL) approach for testing such controllers emulates the external application environment and allows concurrent development of the electronic controllers. Even when the end vehicle is available, if design iterations are to be carried out using "in-vehicle" testing approach, then the same can be time-consuming. Such an approach may also possess safety hazards if malfunction of the ECU impacts occupants/vehicle safety. Many cases require simulation of a range of use-case scenarios as well as system operation under diverse set of environments. For example, for a power-train related application various road conditions/road-grades/frictional coefficients will have to be simulated . HIL set-up allows us to do this on-the-fly. This paper describes a case-study of how HIL testing approach was gainfully employed for an electronic road-speed limiting application. The control system uses an electronic throttle controller as its heart. The HIL system can simulate vehicle dynamics for the end vehicle as well as road-grade, vehicle load etc. This allowed us rapid development of the core control algorithm, which minimized vehicle testing time. Another novel feature of this particular testing was, that the HIL system was implemented on a low cost hardware based on the target controller to be tested. The paper describes the basic scheme in detail and also records our experiences/lessons learnt etc. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18-X 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots. Originality/value: The methodology of the intelligent robot design for highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

But, students or beginners who have no experience and knowledge of electronic engineering or programming languages still feel a considerable barrier to use Arduino. This study analyzes the barrier of beginners in using the open source hardware. In order to resolve the difficulty in firmware programming, we adopt a functional concise script composed of simplified service commands and minimum options to use the open hardware and proposes a new script-based open source hardware programming environment. From the comparison result with previous development toolkit, we confirm that the programming by the proposed script-based simple programming toolkit is substantially simple by adopting simple script and automatic generations of irrelevant instructions, type declarations and semicolons in programming the open source hardware of Arduino. © 2016 SERSC.},

abstract={Robot development could benefit from reuse of hardware and software components. One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework; yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware, component-based robotics is still in its early stages. Moreover, basic functionalities, such as robust odometry and pose tracking, seem to be solved on an ad-hoc basis, while no generic solution can be plugged in a system as an off-the-shelf component. This paper presents two modular tools for the development of robotics applications and how these can be deployed on different robot platforms as off-the-shelf, open hardware and open software, components at the hardware, firmware, and core software levels. A case study based on two mobile platforms is described showing how it is possible to reuse physical components in the building of a mobile robot and provide an off-the-shelf architecture which sports multi-sensor fusion for robust odometry and pose tracking, requiring a fraction of the effort with respect to ad hoc techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new cost-effective data acquisition system using open-source hardware and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed data acquisition (DAQ) system has features that it uses the framed data protocol based on hex encoding, it can acquire multiple data which are not of the same type at different sample rates, and the system receives data through USB communication or serial communication. The software of the proposed system consists of the firmware of a microcontroller and user-defined Simulink function block. The firmware of a microcontroller is in the form of a header file, and the data acquisition can be easily achieved by calling a few functions defined in the header file. The developed user-defined Simulink block can get multiple data at different sample rates by configuring the GUI parameters appropriately. For implementation of the system, we use the Arch Max, which is the open-source hardware with an ARM Cortex-M4 core, and also use a user-defined c-code S-function of Matlab/Simulink. For the demonstration of the superiority of the implemented system, we compare the proposed system's performance with that of the data acquisition system provided in Matlab/Simulink Instrument Control Toolbox. Finally we illustrate how presented system can be actually used by applying the proposed system to DC motor control. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In the former, the input analog signal is modulated with a pseudo-random sequence, and sampled with sub-Nyquist rate to obtain low-dimensional measurements. In the latter, the measurements are transmitted with user datagram protocol to the computer. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hardware implementation. © IEICE 2016.},

It is equally important to enhance the visual appeal of such 3D models with textures. Most of the existing approaches use per-vertex colors, such that the color resolution is limited to mesh resolution. In this paper, we propose a feasible solution for texturing 3D models of people (3D busts) using a low-cost RGB-D sensor setup that automatically constructs the 3D geometry and textures the model in just a few minutes. Experimental evaluations evaluate the performance of the approach on synthetic and real world data against the computational time and visual appeal. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

Sufficient observability and nonobservability criteria are derived, which can be used to identify observable trajectories. Moreover, the paper proposes a filter able to determine the absolute scale of the camera motion without any need for estimating three-dimensional feature positions or a priori knowledge of the absolute attitude. The effectiveness of the filter on low-cost hardware is demonstrated in flight tests with a small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle.

abstract={Soldercubes are a self-reconfiguring modular robot (MR) system whose modules are light weight, low cost, and designed with manufacturability for large batch production in mind. The frequently cited promises of modular robotics—versatility, robustness, and low cost—assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open source hardware. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

To investigate haptic e-learning without user programming, we developed HandsOn, a conceptual model for exploratory, embodied STEM education software; and implemented it with the SpringSim interface and a task battery for high school students. In two studies, we confirm that low-cost devices can render haptics adequately for this purpose, find qualitative impact of SpringSim on student strategies and curiosity, and identify directions for tool improvement and extension. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

In this paper, we describe a follow-up project in which we use TalkBox as a prototyping platform to facilitate co-design and co-fabrication of DIY-AT. We present results from (1) a workshop in which users with disabilities and their parents/caregivers fabricated their own TalkBoxes, and (2) a collaborative co-design session with a nonverbal child and his mother wherein the potential for TalkBox variants led to novel design decisions. We illustrate the outcome of our process by describing the multi-vocabulary variant called Hot Swappable Talk- Box, in which RFID technology is used to afford easy switching among different vocabulary sets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The science education budget of many secondary schools has decreased, while shortages and environmental concerns linked to conventional Science Education Equipment and Materials (SEEMs) have emerged. Thus, in some schools, resourceful educators produce low-cost equipment from basic materials and use these so-called improvised SEEMs in practical work. However, scattered in the literature are diverse challenges linked to the production and/or use of improvised SEEMs. Thus, the purpose of the literature review presented here was to design a framework useful in the reduction of these challenges. In this regard, we systematically gathered, characterised and clarified the challenges, in addition to collecting and reflecting on ways of reducing them. This enabled us to design the framework which focuses on educator learning and practice in the improvisation of SEEMs under specified conditions. Regarding the implementation of the framework, we have discussed the role that stakeholders including professional development providers and researchers may play. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={Machines in general and robots in particular, appeal greatly to children and youth. With the widespread availability of low-cost open source hardware and free open source software, robotics has become central to the promotion of STEM education in schools, and active learning at college/university level. With robots, children in developed countries gain from technological immersion, or exposure to the latest technologies and gadgets. Yet, developing countries like India still lag in the use of robots at school and even college level In this paper, an innovative and low-cost educational outdoor mobile robot is developed for deployment by school children during volunteer trash pickup. The wheeled mobile robot is constructed with inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components, including single board computer and miscellaneous sensors. It is remote controlled by children using smart phone app or video game controller. The robot is also equipped with air quality sensors to display air pollution levels to the children and public. The project can improve STEM education, environmental literacy and civic engagement among school children, while providing interdisciplinary service learning opportunities for college and university students. Results of a prototype mobile robot design, development, and deployment are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. © 2016 IEEE.},

The System-In-the-Loop (SIL) simulation provides a platform to develop a full FPGA-based BMS, using high-level tools to generate Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for the FPGA. The work has been developed into a reference design that is freely available and can be run on low-cost hardware. Results have been obtained for SOC calculation times for several alternative hardware implementations in the FPGA. The execution time to update one battery cell ranges from 44.9μs down to 16.5μs.

Content owners and publishers need video transcoders to adapt their videos to different formats, bitrates, and qualities before streaming them to end users with the best quality of service. In this paper, we report our experience to develop and deploy VideoCoreCluster, a low-cost, highly efficient video transcoder cluster for live video streaming services. We implemented the video transcoder cluster with low-cost single board computers, specifically the Raspberry Pi Model B. The quality of the transcoded video delivered by our cluster is comparable with the best open source softwarebased video transcoder, and our video transcoders consume much less energy. We designed a scheduling algorithm based on priority and capacity so that the cluster manager can leverage the characteristics of adaptive bitrate video streaming technologies to provide a reliable and scalable service for the video streaming infrastructure. We have replaced the software-based transcoders for some TV channels in a live TV streaming service deployment on our university campus with this cluster. © 2016 by The USENIX Association.

abstract={In resource-constrained applications, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is preferable for the property of shorter key size with comparable security. Binary extension fields are usually used for area-optimized implementations, since the complex carry-propagation logics are avoided over these fields. However, efficient ECC implementations over (general) prime fields are still challenging for low-area constraint. As a popular implementation platform for cryptographic algorithms, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) attracts more and more attentions for these applications due to its nice properties of flexibility and short development cycle. In this paper, we propose a compact and efficient arithmetic logical unit (ALU) by highly integrating the functions of Montgomery modular multiplications, additions and subtractions over general prime fields. Then we design a low-cost hardware architecture for generic elliptic curve point multiplications for FPGA platforms. Experimental results indicate that the implementation only occupies 105 Slices, 2 DSP blocks and 2 BRAMs in Spartan-6 FPGA. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation is the smallest for general prime fields in FPGAs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={Developing telepresence robots is one of the most important trends in the robotics research area, where the user acts as he/she is located in a remote location. In 2010, telepresence robots became a noticeable trend after the robot “QB” that introduced by Silicon Valley start-up Anybots (Robotics trends for 2012. IEEE Robot. Autom. Mag. 19(1):119–123, 2012). Although, the availability of “QB” as a commercial telepresence robot, its cost made it unavailable for most users. In this work, a low-cost telepresence robot is presented using iRobot-Create, Microsoft Kinect sensor, and video glasses. The proposed system makes the user feels like he/she is located in a different location and acting as in the normal life (walking, stop, rotating his/her head). The user takes feedback via a streaming video from the remote location to a pair of video glasses worn by him. The remote unit consists of three components: a single iRobot-Create, a laptop, and two web-cams. In the user side, the user’s movements are recognized using Microsoft Kinect sensor. We use the RGB camera in Microsoft Kinect sensor for streaming the video of the user to the remote side. So, People in the remote side see the user, as he/she is located with them. The results of the proposed system show that the user is integrated in another environment using low-cost hardware components. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={In order to develop improved diagnosis and therapies for the highly prevalent chronic fibroproliferative diseases, it is of utmost importance to construct efficient assays to detect collagen biomarkers. We have successfully created a paper-based FRET assay for the fast, inexpensive and direct detection of collagen triple helix. We have demonstrated that the adsorption of the dye-labeled probe peptide onto the GO-immobilized paper quenches the fluorescence of the dye, while the hybridization of the probe peptide with the target collagen peptide results in the desorption of the probe peptide from GO, thus restoring the fluorescence. We have also shown that this novel assay is highly specific to the target collagen peptide sequence with little interference from other proteins, and it can be applied for quantitative detection in complex biological fluids. Our integration of the GO-based FRET assay with a patterned paper provides a powerful new tool for the detection of collagen molecules with many superior features: tiny volumes of samples, multichannel detection mode, easy operation and low-cost equipment. This assay may have promising applications to fast screen multiple target collagen sequences for the discovery of new collagen biomarkers. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) refers to various interconnected devices, typically supplied with limited computational and communication resources. Most of the devices are designed to operate with limited memory and processing capability, low bandwidth, short range and other characteristics of low cost hardware. The resulting networks are exposed to traffic loss and prone to other vulnerabilities. One of the major concerns is to ensure that the network communication among these deployed devices remains at required level of Quality of Service (QoS) of different IoT applications. The purpose of this paper is to highlight delay contributing factors in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) since providing low end- To-end delay is a crucial issue in IoT environment especially for mission critical applications. Various research efforts in relevance to this aspect are then presented.},

abstract={Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements. © 2015.},

Transfering the large multimedia content while guaranteeing QoS requirements is a very challenge to solve, given that multimedia applications convey a large mass of data that requires high transmission rate and intensive treatment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Geographic Multipath Routing Protocol (GMRP) that satisfies the realistic characteristics of multimedia transmission in wireless sensor networks. Simulations results show a significant contribution and indicate that GMRP achieves lower average delay, higher packet delivery ratio and ensures load balancing in the network. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to noninvasive biometric maternity verification and baby-switching prevention in maternity wards based on dual biometric fingerprint scanner. The proposed system is expected to solve issues that have occurred in many countries regarding stealing or mixing the identities of newborn babies. The solution is based on a device that acquires biometric samples from the mother and her newborn baby right after birth and generates the unique reference of the pair. The same device is used to verify the bound of biometric samples before the mother and the baby are allowed to leave the maternity ward. The privacy of stored templates is provided by cancelable biometrics while the auxiliary data are secured with strong cryptographic protection. The main contribution of the proposed approach is a very high level of proof of maternity for each newborn baby, as well as, the prevention of replacing identities of newborn babies in maternity wards, with a system that can be realized via low cost hardware. © 2016, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

A robot manipulator in conjunction with visual servo control is applied to autonomously grasp the object. To increase the accuracy of the object compression values associated with the used low-cost hardware, an extended Kalman filter is adopted to fuse the sensing data obtained from webcam and gripper encoder. The grasping forces are measured by a piezoresistive pressure sensor installed on the jaw of the manipulator. The force and position data are used to represent the stiffness property of the grasped objects. An on-line least square algorithm is applied to fit a stiffness equation with time-varying parameters.

abstract={In December 2013 the management of the International Airports of Rome (ADR) decided to assign me to project a fire safety system similar to EN 81-73: 2005[1], for the lifts installed in Leonardo da Vinci Airport of Rome Fiumicino. The specific requirement of the Direction of the airport was to implement a fully automatic system, with no human supervision, to prevent passengers in a lift to be stranded on a floor, or trapped in a lift, where a fire has broken out. The Direction of ADR added some further specific project requirements: - The hardware and software of the system was to have "open" architecture - The system had to be reliable and with a high level of safety; - Reduce to a minimum the probability of false alarms and safeguard the capability of the system to start with a real fire alarm. The Satellite terminal G gates were chosen to start the project. Escalators and moving walks (EMWs) have also been included in the system. To reduce the probability of false alarms a 3D simulation model of a map of fire sensors, based on about 1400 sensors in the Terminal and statistical data coming from about 18,000 fire sensors, has been prepared and verified. The requirements of open hardware (PLCs (Programmable Logic Computers) and electronic equipment) and open software (PLC and SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) software) have been fully accomplished and the system is now operative in the Terminal G gates. ADR management has recently decided to extend the system to the rest of Leonardo da Vinci Airport. The FEMS project has been recently approved for lifts, escalators and moving walks in public transport by the Italian Ministero delle Infrastrutture e Trasporti (Italian Infrastructures and Transports Authority). © 2016 The University of Northampton, The CIBSE Lifts Group, LEIA and the authors.},

Using low-cost electronic components, we built a working prototype, driven by a simple software that is open source and user-friendly. In order to test our system, we used it to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and counter electrodes of platinum and cobalt sulfide using both rigid glass-FTO and flexible ITO-PEN substrates. The electrodes as well as the complete devices have been characterized through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The solar cell devices have been characterized through current versus voltage curves (I-V) under simulated solar illumination. © Springer-Verlag London 2016.},

abstract={The paper describes the strategy adopted to assess the structural condition of the tallest historic tower in Mantua (Italy) after the Italian seismic sequence of May-June 2012 and exemplifies the application of health monitoring using (automated) operational modal analysis. The post-earthquake survey (including extensive visual inspection, historic and documentary research, non-destructive (ND) material testing, and ambient vibration tests) highlighted the poor state of preservation of the upper part of the tower; subsequently, a dynamic monitoring system (consisting of a few accelerometers and one temperature sensor) was installed in the building to address the preservation of the historic structure, and automated modal identification was continuously performed. Despite the low levels of vibration that existed in operational conditions, the analysis of data collected over a period of about 15 months allowed to assess and model the effects of changing temperature on modal frequencies and to detect the occurrence of abnormal behavior and damage under the changing environment. The monitoring results demonstrate the potential key role of vibration-based structural health monitoring, implemented through low-cost hardware solutions and appropriate software tools, in the preventive conservation and the condition-based maintenance of historic towers. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper proposes a low-cost hardware architecture based on concurrent dual-band digital pre-distorter (DPD). The architecture is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) to compensate for the nonlinearity of the concurrent dual-band power amplifier (PA). This implementation introduces a novel model complexity reduction technique into system, namely, time-division multiplexing for out-of-band lookup tables (LUTs) sharing. Performances are evaluated with an experimental test setup using a wideband class-F PA. The dual-band signal center frequency separated by 80 MHz. Lower and upper center frequency are located at 2.61 GHz and 2.69 GHz, respectively. This novel DPD implementation maintains excellent performance, but uses hardware resources reduced by 29.17% compared with conventional approaches. The results show that the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is less than - 59 dBc and normalized mean square error (NMSE) is around - 62dB for lower sideband (LSB) and - 63dB for upper sideband (USB).},

abstract={Precision Agriculture in conjunction with Variable Rate Technology aims at increasing productivity while reducing resource usage (water, fertilizers, pesticides and others). Within this context, the farm's management decisions include information from data collected about the crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis. There are several means of obtaining information about the plants health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the soil and/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery, to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access, low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely Raspberry Pi boards, that are used to collect, process and store information. © 2016},

abstract={The ever-growing need for energy efficient computation requires adequate support for energy-aware thread scheduling that offers insight into a systems behavior for improved application energy/performance optimizations. Runtime accurate monitoring of energy consumed by every component of a multicore embedded system is an important feature to be considered for future designs. Although, important steps have been made in this direction, the problem of distributing energy consumption among threads executed on different cores for shared components remains an ongoing struggle. We aim at designing a generic low-cost and energy efficient hardware infrastructure which supports thread level energy accounting of hardware components in a multi-core system. The proposed infrastructure provides upper software layers with per thread and per component energy accounting API, similar with performance profiling functions. Implementation results indicate that the proposed solution adds around 10% resource overhead to the monitored system. Regarding the power estimates, the one derived by our solution achieves a correlation degree of more than 95% with the ones obtained from physical power measurements. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The expectations of point-of-care technologies (POCT) are being increasingly shaped by the patient-centric narrative of P5 (predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory, and populationbased) medicine. Shifting the focus of our healthcare system to a personalized and preemptive approach will depend partly on the availability of field-deployable measurement technologies that provide rapid biometric information to providers and patients. In order to respond to the changing healthcare paradigm and hasten the integration of emerging sensor materials into clinically useful point-of-care (POC) approaches, it is essential that the sensor materials community understand and appreciate the clinical context, expectations, and aspirations of the healthcare consumers. After reviewing the drivers of the P5 medicine initiative, we review the context within which the POCT will be used, and some of the challenges associated with delivering portable, fast response, and highly reliable measurement technologies that can be used with complex biofluids in a range of settings by a variety of users. We conclude by emphasizing the potential synergies of linking POCT's to the "connected health" model which integrates mobile technologies, low-cost hardware, healthcare IT systems, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to connect all stakeholders for a timely sharing of pertinent health information necessary for timely and personalized healthcare. © MYU K.K.},

abstract={Model predictive control is a promising approach for vibration attenuation, as it allows the direct consideration of constraints and the use of system models for predicting future behavior. However, the straight application of model predictive control is in general challenging, as the efficient implementation requires expert insight, especially for fast systems on low-end embedded platforms. This paper investigates the practical feasibility and deployment of model predictive control for the active vibration attenuation of a cantilever beam using a low-end, low-cost 8-bit microcontroller. The control aim is to suppress vibrations while respecting the input constraints due to the depolarization limits of the piezoceramic actuators. The embedded model predictive control code is automatically generated using the μAO-MPC code generation tool. The resulting implementation is real-time feasible even on the utilized low-cost, low-end Arduino UNO electronics prototyping platform, which is based on the widely used Atmel ATmega328, a 8-bit AVR architecture reduced instruction set processor. The memory demand, computation time and performance are examined under various settings. As shown, real-time execution of the μAO-MPC generated code for horizon lengths of up to 7 steps for a second order model and a 20 ms sample time are computationally feasible even on the low cost hardware used here.},

abstract={There are some data centers that are located far from the main data center for ensuring continuity of company's Information Technology operations in case the main data center encounters a serious downtime especially for companies engaged to work in distributed manner to increase quality-of -service to their customers. Environmental downtime is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity, power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50oC., the supervisor at remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of servers in auxiliary data centers. The data center environmental monitoring represents a step forward towards addressing awareness monitoring of energy efficiency and data centers located far with ability to receive a notification by email.},

abstract={We developed an algorithm for automatically detecting small and poorly contrasted (dim) moving objects in real-time, within video sequences acquired through a steady infrared camera. The algorithm is suitable for different situations since it is independent of the background characteristics and of changes in illumination. Unlike other solutions, small objects of any size (up to single-pixel), either hotter or colder than the background, can be successfully detected. The algorithm is based on accurately estimating the background at the pixel level and then rejecting it. A novel approach permits background estimation to be robust to changes in the scene illumination and to noise, and not to be biased by the transit of moving objects. Care was taken in avoiding computationally costly procedures, in order to ensure the real-time performance even using low-cost hardware. The algorithm was tested on a dataset of 12 video sequences acquired in different conditions, providing promising results in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate, independently of background and objects characteristics. In addition, the detection map was produced frame by frame in real-time, using cheap commercial hardware. The algorithm is particularly suitable for applications in the fields of video-surveillance and computer vision. Its reliability and speed permit it to be used also in critical situations, like in search and rescue, defence and disaster monitoring. © 2016 SPIE.},

abstract={Three dimensional (3-D) vision techniques in the field of Computer Vision aims mainly at reconstructing a scene to find its three dimensional geometrical information. Active methods of sensing in a generic sense have better sensing abilities than passive methods since they release some form of energy into the environment for sensing. Structured Light technique in 3-D computer vision is one such active method which throws a light pattern on to the scene whose image is then captured by an intensity camera. The structured light technique is by far the most rugged of all 3-D reconstruction methods in the current scenario. The technique is so rugged that even passive methods such as stereo vision makes use of the pattern projection advantage thus resulting in many hybrid approaches. The paper presents an extremely low cost structured light method for scene reconstruction using off-the-shelf hardware. The objects considered are deliberately made texture-less and no contrast between the object and background is ensured so as to demonstrate the abilities of the structured light technique. The reconstructed information of the object is utilized for identifying its identity. The need comes in the form that such identification processes cannot otherwise be done using 2-D visual features. The concept is validated for a set of three different cylindrical objects which basically vary in their slope of the top surfaces. The paper intends to demonstrate the ease of developing a complicated approach for 3-D vision using simple low-cost hardware and finally appreciates the wide range of application possible. © 2016, International Science Press.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are recognized key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm since its inception. WSNs are a resilient and effective distributed data collection technology, but issues related to reliability, autonomy, cost, and accessibility to application domain experts still limit their wide scale use. Commercial solutions can effectively address vertical application domains, but they often lead to technology lock-ins that limit horizontal composability and reuse. We review some important barriers that hinder WSN use in IoT applications and highlight the main effort and cost components. With these elements in mind, we propose an open hardware-software development platform that can optimize the value flow between technologies and actors with stakes in WSN applications. To reach its objectives, the platform fosters reuse, low-effort low-risk fast prototyping accessible to application domain experts, easy integration of new technology and IP blocks, and simplifies the permeation of research results in commercial applications. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={Health monitoring is nowadays one of the hottest markets due to the increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario. © 2016 L.

abstract={Early hazard recognition in the construction environment plays a pivotal role in accident prevention. Modern technological advances in the field of visualization and display hardware enable unrivaled situational experiences when using headmounted displays. Low-cost hardware, high refresh rates and increasing resolutions of devices enable immersion into a virtual world with useful safety applications for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Realistic particle effects and audio simulation support the perception of human test subjects experiencing a construction site from a first person view. Such test infrastructure and environment generate more accurate reactions to dangers emerging from hazardous site conditions. The scope of the presented work is developing the framework for gathering scientific data that, once analyzed, defines new approaches towards situational awareness and learning. The particular application we investigate is the understanding of the safety behavior of pedestrian workers performing tasks near heavy equipment. To create a realistic virtual reality environment, we are importing building information modeling (BIM) data into the Unreal Engine 4 for visualization with modern, lowcost HMD hardware. The developed first person virtual reality infrastructure allows us to test human behavior in several unsafe work scenarios that are common in practice. While the test subjects experience the hazards in a safe test environment, their learning is made analyzable through the use of computational logging operating on a multitude set of data records collected in the virtual environment. Results are presented that show the potential impact of the developed method on existing construction safety applications, including but not limited to rapid hazard evaluation and learning.},

abstract={The 21st century global competition has emphasized design of innovative products and solutions as the core competency requested today in the job market for engineers. To produce good design thinkers, design activities must be implemented in engineering curriculums, and have to start at early years. In this prospect, many leading universities have launched many interesting initiatives. These initiatives are, however, arduous for implementation in the context of universities in the developing countries due to deep-rooted local constraints, like shortage of financial and skilled human resources. Therefore, some tailored design learning initiatives, taking into account these constraints, have to be developed. In this context, a cost-effective project has been designed and implemented, in our faculty, to early introduce mechanical engineering students, in their first years, to engineering design. The proposed project was designed with respect to a proposed framework of desired engineering design competencies in conjunction with concerns for overcoming constraints and barriers of implementation context. The project encompasses two successive activities for the first and second years. The first activity plunges the students in a design thinking approach to create robotic applications using only cost-effective robotic kits. The second activity is dedicated to the design, analysis, and building of mechanical systems using only commonly used materials and cheap open hardware devices. Through this project, the students significantly improved some targeted skills as creative problem solving, communication, and teamwork. Finally, the project is thought to be valuable for all universities with similar context of limited resources. © SAGE Publications.},

The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a "how-To" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning.

abstract={Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices between humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications, however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g. USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding "ideal" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested - the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board - or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip - could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI uses.

abstract={Background: Despite plenty of applications and improvements related to traditional networking schema based on Internet Protocol (IP), there is a lack of a generic networking schema for low-cost Internet of Things, based on non-TCP/UDP protocols, standards and devices. One may also point out limited possibilities for address-free networking at a small scale (within a room, a workplace, at home) based on broadcast and multicast, as well as multi-hop relaying. Method: We took into attention several communication modes and hardware modules for AVR and Raspberry microcontrollers, both wired and wireless, spiked with symmetric cryptography and textual (human-readable) format of the messages. Results: In this paper we propose a new way of networking called Home Computer Network (HCN), devoted to home and DIY applications. HCN protocol stands for a flexible standard of generic, stateless information exchange among two or more nodes, regardless the communication links on the way from a sender node to all the receivers. The proposal covers both address-free and addressable transmission. In the address-free mode, the incoming message is to be accepted by the receiving node based on message contents, i.e., its semantics and parameters. Once a message is accepted, the node performs certain actions related to the message. In parallel, the message is re-transmitted to other communication channels (except the channel the message arrived by) to be inspected by other nodes – this is so called multi-hop communication. To eliminate possible loops in information flow, the repeated messages are identified and eliminated, based on unique descriptors of the messages. In the addressable mode, the message is linked with an identifier of the receiving node – such a message is accepted only by a certain node, and is not propagated in multi-hop mode by any other node. Each message may be encrypted. Due to limited node resources, simple, however powerful encryption standard has been applied, namely xxTEA algorithm, with pre-shared encryption key common for all the nodes. Conclusion: HCN makes it possible to automate the process of linking several micro-controllers at home into a single consistent network, with limited amount of programmers’ work and with very low-cost hardware such as AVR-based computers, Raspberry boards, 2,4GHz and 433/868MHz networking modules, Bluetooth, classical cable connections such as RS-232 and RS-485, 1-wire, SPI, and many other DIY solutions. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},
