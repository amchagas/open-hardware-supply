TI SOTPM: Software One-Time Programmable Memory to Protect Shared Memory on
   ARM Trustzone
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English

DE ARM TrustZone; secure communication; shared memory
ID SECURE
AB In ARM TrustZone-based architecture, shared memory is one of the most useful schemes to enable isolated execution environments supported by TrustZone to communicate between environments. However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products.

DE Self-propelled wheelchair; toilet accessibility; transferability;
   multipurpose indoor wheelchair; commode wheelchair; open Source hardware
AB Purpose
   Existing wheelchair (WC) designs lack independent toilet accessibility, transferability and indoor manoeuvrability combined in a WC. In this regard, a new WC model is proposed to simultaneously accommodate these distinct and essential features. In this open-source hardware project, the design, analysis and fabrication of a new active commode WC for indoor applications are performed.
   Materials and method
   A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design.
   Results
   The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access.
   Conclusion
   The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge in development of Open Source Hardware, especially open source ventilators. Many of these open source ventilator projects have adopted an open-when-finished model due to legitimate legal and liability concerns. This, however, has led to a proliferation of projects with teams across the world independently designing over a hundred mutually incompatible ventilators, representing a huge amount of duplicated effort. A functioning design is necessary but not sufficient for a project to help patients. The device must be taken through regulatory approval by a manufacturer that understands why design decisions were taken. In this article we argue that the open design process developed for Open Source Software can be used for Open Source Hardware. This process not only allows remote teams to work together improving a single design, it also provides the rich history of design decisions that manufacturers need to take the device through regulatory approval.

AB In recent years, some official reports, to produce best products regarding quality, quantity and economic conditions, recommend that the farming sector should benefit with new tools and techniques coming from Information and Communications Technology (ICT) realm. In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization.
   Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production.
   In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafames (Castello, Spain). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The FloripaSat-I project consists of an initiative from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in Brazil, to train students to design, test and integrate innovative space systems. The group just developed its first open-source CubeSat, the FloripaSat-I, which aims to empower students to develop space systems through a practical approach, where they have full control of the design and test of a real spacecraft. The project has already gone through all the stages of a CubeSat mission prior to the launching and operation stages. A prototype of the satellite, as well the engineering models 1 and 2 (EM-I and EM-II) were built. The expertise provided by the engineering models allows the development of a functional flight model (FM). This paper presents the validation and qualification tests that pass various FloripaSat-I models, from the engineering model to the flight model. All stages of the project are described, the tests performed in each phase, as well as the lessons learned. Thus, this paper serves as a guidance for other university teams that want to test their own CubeSats, as well as teams that want to use the open-source hardware and software left as heritage by this project.

AB Inadequate weather conditions are one of the main threats to the correct development of sensitive crops, where a bad situation can lead to greater stress on plants and their weakness against various diseases. This statement is especially decisive in the cultivation of the vineyard. Meteorological monitoring of vineyard parcels is vital to detect and prevent possible fungal diseases. The development of new Information and Communication Technologies, linked to the Smart Farming movement, together with the reduced cost of electronic components, have favoured a greater availability of meteorological monitoring stations to get to know first-class hand the state of the vineyard smallholdings. This work provides a set of over 750,000 environmental raw data records collected by low-cost Internet of Things nodes, primarily located within vineyard smallholdings. The published observations were collected between 2018-04-01 and 2018-10-31 and were validated in previous research to determine the data's reliability. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Although the cure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) will come in the form of pharmaceutical solutions and/or a vaccine, one of the only ways to face it at present is to guarantee the best quality of health for patients, so that they can overcome the disease on their own. Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge. The device meets all medical requirements and is developed with open-source hardware and software.

ID OPTICAL RECONSTRUCTION MICROSCOPY; MEMBRANE; PROTEINS; STORM
AB New innovations in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) have revolutionized optical imaging, enabling the characterization of biological structures and interactions with unprecedented detail and resolution. However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within similar to 15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70.

AB This paper presents a fuzzy inference system and microcontroller-based protection scheme for a combined underground (UG) cable and overhead (OH) transmission line system. The scheme detects, classifies, and locates the fault occurring either in an UG cable or OH transmission line network. Furthermore, the scheme identifies the faulty section. An existing Indian power network i.e., real power system network of C.G. state, consisting of 132 kV, 50 Hz power transmission network connecting Doma substation 220/132 kV to the 132/33 kV Gas Insulated Substation Rawanbhata through combined transmission network is considered. This real power transmission network is simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink software. In this paper, the hardware implementation is also carried out using an open-source hardware, Arduino, which consists of an Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller. Both the simulation and hardware results validate that the proposed scheme is accurately detecting, classifying, and locating the fault in less than a half cycle time. Moreover, the percentage error in determining the location of a fault is less than 0.7%.

AB Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is a powerful technique capable of resolving both relative and absolute distances within and between structurally dynamic biomolecules. High instrument costs, and a lack of open-source hardware and acquisition software have limited smFRET's broad application by non-specialists. Here, we present the smfBox, a cost-effective confocal smFRET platform, providing detailed build instructions, open-source acquisition software, and full validation, thereby democratising smFRET for the wider scientific community. Broad uptake of smFRET has been hindered by high instrument costs and a lack of open-source hardware and acquisition software. Here, the authors present the smfBox, a cost-effective open-source platform capable of measuring precise FRET efficiencies between dyes on freely diffusing single molecules.

TI Easy to build low-power GPS drifters with local storage and a cellular
   modem made from off-the-shelf components
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Drifters that track their position are important tools in studying the hydrodynamic behavior of rivers. Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to "tinkering scientists", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the "tinkering engineer". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise.

AB The importance of monitoring the pressures in the water supply system combined with the high costal implementation and maintenance of devices capable of this, corroborated the objective of this study. Therefore, we seek to develop low-cost equipment to measure water pressure. For this, 15 MPR dataloggers were produced, costing R$ 20815 each, calibrated with a commercial equipment. The equipment were installed in residences with different consumptions profiles and altitudes in the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso, for 43 days. The results obtained were satisfied, promising, and showed that the equipment is robust and precise with a R-2 of 0.9986 when compared with the commercial equipment, in addition to being possible to evaluate the city's supply system and the necessary interventions.

AB Microencapsulation is a widely studied cell therapy and tissue bioengineering technique, since it is capable of creating an immune-privileged site, protecting encapsulated cells from the host immune system. Several polymers have been tested, but sodium alginate is in widespread use for cell encapsulation applications, due to its low toxicity and easy manipulation. Different cell encapsulation methods have been described in the literature using pressure differences or electrostatic changes with high cost commercial devices (about 30,000 US dollars). Herein, a low-cost device (about 100 US dollars) that can be created by commercial syringes or 3D printer devices has been developed. The capsules, whose diameter is around 500 mu m and can decrease or increase according to the pressure applied to the system, is able to maintain cells viable and functional. The hydrogel porosity of the capsule indicates that the immune system is not capable of destroying host cells, demonstrating that new studies can be developed for cell therapy at low cost with microencapsulation production. This device may aid pre-clinical and clinical projects in low- and middle-income countries and is lined up with open source equipment devices.

AB Multispectral imaging (MI) techniques are being used very often to identify different properties of nature in several domains, going from precision agriculture to environmental studies, not to mention quality inspection of pharmaceutical production, art restoration, biochemistry, forensic sciences or geology, just to name some. Different implementations are commercially available from the industry and yet there is quite an interest from the scientific community to spread its use to the majority of society by means of cost effectiveness and ease of use for solutions. These devices make the most sense when combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), going a step further and alleviating repetitive routines which could be strenuous if traditional methods were adopted. In this work, a low cost and modular solution for a multispectral camera is presented, based on the use of a single panchromatic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor combined with a rotating wheel of interchangeable band pass optic filters. The system is compatible with open source hardware permitting one to capture, process, store and/or transmit data if needed. In addition, a calibration and characterization methodology has been developed for the camera, allowing not only for quantifying its performance, but also able to characterize other CMOS sensors in the market in order to select the one that best suits the budget and application. The process was experimentally validated by mounting the camera in a Dji Matrice 600 UAV to uncover vegetation indices in a reduced area of palm trees plantation. Results are presented for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showing a generated colored map with the captured information.

AB Precision aquaculture is a new field that allows farmers to have better control over aquaculture processes, facilitating decision-making and improving efficiency. The implementation and evaluation of a low-cost water-quality monitoring system based on open-source hardware, which is easy to rebuild for scientific applications, is reported in this paper. The proposed system measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, taking records and sending information through a wireless protocol (ZigBee) to a graphical user interface which can display information numerically and graphically, as well as simultaneously storing the information in a database. These variables are very important for aquaculture, as they have a direct influence on critical culture parameters such as growth and survival. Although it is a low-cost system, it offers good quality data and demonstrates efficiency for its use in precision aquaculture.

AB Servo systems are feedback control systems characterized by position, speed, and/or acceleration outputs. Nowadays, industrial advances make the electronic stages in these systems obsolete compared to the mechanical elements, which generates a recurring problem in technological, commercial and industrial applications. This article presents a methodology for the development of an open-architecture controller that is based on reconfigurable hardware under the open source concept for servo applications. The most outstanding contribution of this paper is the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for online self tuning with a focus on both high-quality servo control and reduction of vibrations during the positioning of a linear motion system. The proposed techniques have been validated on a real platform and form a novel, effective approach as compared to the conventional tuning methods that employ empirical or analytical solutions and cannot improve their parameter set. The controller was elaborated from the Graphical User Interface to the logical implementation while using free tools. This approach also allows for modification and updates to be made easily, thereby reducing the susceptibility to obsolescence. A comparison of the logical implementation with the manufacturer software was also conducted in order to test the performance of free tools in FPGAs. The Graphical User Interface developed in Python presents features, such as speed profiling, controller auto-tuning, measurement of main parameters, and monitoring of servo system vibrations.

ID METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; SEPARATION; CHEMISTRY
AB Affordable and readily available microelectronics are becoming prevalent in teaching laboratories however these useful and economic tools are not used widely in either academia or industry. Herein we report how a metal organic framework (MOF) synthetic route can be optimized using an in situ monitoring apparatus designed in-house on open source hardware for under $100. We demonstrate that the MOF can be produced at atmospheric pressure, an improvement over previous reports, but also with a reduction in reaction time of 93%. This improvement in reaction time was predicted after a single experiment using the monitoring kit showing how efficiencies in the lab can be gained with very little experimental and monetary overhead while minimising the resources used.

AB The development of lab-on-a-chip technology and its applications in biochemical and biomedical analyses has, during the last two decades, led to the potential realisation of portable and on-site detection devices, the so-called point-of-care (PoC) detection systems. These are essentially cheap, easy-to-handle systems, offering rapid sample-to-answer results to non-technical operators. In this perspective, we do not review all the current advances of Lab-on-a-chip techniques for the realisation of PoC. Instead, we aim to provide insight into what we foresee as the three most important factors to play the essential roles for succeeding in making commercially viable PoC pathogen-detection devices. The three insights are namely: the utilizations of (i) disposable polymer (microfluidic) chips, (ii) the implementation of surface-bound (or solid-phase) nucleic-acid amplification techniques and (iii) relying (more) on open-source hardware and software.

AB Relevant to mobile health, the design of a portable electrocardiograph (ECG) device using AD823X microchips as the analog front-end is presented. Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device's several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized.

ID HYDROCARBON CONTAMINATION; ELECTRON; MICROSCOPY; FILMS
AB Hydrocarbon contamination plagues high-resolution and analytical electron microscopy by depositing carbonaceous layers onto surfaces during electron irradiation, which can render carefully prepared specimens useless. Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10(-10 )hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.

AB Despite advances in measuring fluid viscosity, we still lack portable viscometers to analyze shear ratevarying fluid characteristics in the form of open-source hardware that non-expert users can easily make and use. We present a hand-held, automatic capillary viscometer, termed Viscopette which can be fabricated simply by assembling globally available mechanical (a stepper motor and an inline pressure sensor), fluidic (a positive-displacement pipette and a cut tubing piece), electronic (an Arduino board) parts in a 3D-printed housing. The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm x 7.3 cm x 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition. With the advantages of easeof-use, portability, and shear-rate controllability, we demonstrate the Viscopette's ability to accurately analyze Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Our method addresses the unmet need in portable, highperformance viscometers suitable for use as an open-source equipment, which can facilitate on-site, accurate viscosity analysis even by non-expert users.

AB Repeat observations underpin our understanding of environmental processes, but financial constraints often limit scientists' ability to deploy dense networks of conventional commercial instrumentation. Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King's College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors -0.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales.

AB A CE instrument that can be assembled from commercially available components with minimal construction effort is described. Except for the electronic control circuitry no specially made parts are required. It is based on a flexible design of microfluidic, electropneumatic, and electronic sections and different configurations can easily be implemented. Automated injection into the capillary is performed hydrodynamically by the application of a pressure for a controlled length of time. The performance of the device was tested with a contactless conductivity detector by separating different metal ions. In addition, nine metal cations related to the quality of honey were separated in 2.3 min and four honey samples were analysed quantitatively to demonstrate the applicability of the method.

AB The commercial data acquisition instruments designed for three-component microtremor measurements are usually very expensive devices. In this paper, a low-cost, computer-aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H/V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analog-to-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis.

AB This work presents an experimental activity developed in a teacher training course in natural sciences. In the activity, a physical phenomenon present in the homeothermic animals was modeled, consisting of the greater exposure to heat transfer in young animals compared to adult specimens of the same species. This thermal situation has important consequences for animal behavior. The explanation is based on the fact that the relationship between the body area of the small animal and that of the adult, gives a greater value than the relationship between the respective volumes. Representative aluminum pieces are used to model the phenomenon, and open hardware is used to perform the temperature measurements in a calorimetry experiment. The construction of the necessary elements to develop it is detailed.

AB Zooplankton play vital ecological roles that maintain aquatic ecosystems. Imaging instruments have enabled in situ observations of these organisms that can be automated and are less invasive than traditional sampling methods. However, these instruments are often costly and require sophisticated engineering expertise to operate. The In situ Plankton Assemblage eXplorer (IPAX) is an open-source low-cost imaging platform for zooplankton studies. The IPAX is a programmable instrument that has powerful LED illumination and a high-resolution camera that can image zooplankton in situ, while material costs are less than USD $450. The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 mu m features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm x 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs. The IPAX enables economical and autonomous surveys of zooplankton in various aquatic habitats. Its low cost facilitates construction and deployment of multiple units that can cover large spatial areas, while its versatility also allows adaptations to many experimental needs for aquatic ecology.

AB Recent developments in information and communication technology have caused a major impact on training and production techniques.The concept of virtual instrument has led to the application of new techniques in the area of measurement and production systems design.Virtual instruments have begun to replace the expensive and complex instruments that are the main part of real laboratories.Thus, the process of designing, realizing and modernizing laboratories has been facilitated. Today, developments in NdFeb magnets have caused these magnets to become essential elements in many technology fields. NdFeB magnets are widely used in the engines of hybrid electric vehicles due to the maximum energy product (BHmax). In addition, usage of NdFeB in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, electric motors, various generators and in large-scale or small-scale wind energy generators have increased significantly. In this study, before the production of NdFeB magnets, a virtual laboratory platform which can be used in research and development studies and production is realized.The developed virtual platform is designed and run as a desktop application. In future studies, web based applications will be developed by using open source hardware.In the study, mathematical functions were obtained from data related to B-r(permanent magnetism), H-c(magnetic coercivity), BHmax, and Curie temperature obtained in researches on different NdFeB alloys in real laboratory.The virtual laboratory platform was prepared with the obtained functions. The laboratory system can be used in industry for multi-purpose. In addition, it also allows for use for educational purposes. It is aimed to save cost and time during the the research and development studies in magnet design and to perform different magnet works.

AB The separation of suspensions and immiscible liquids by the laboratory centrifuge is widely used in such fields as chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and clinical medicine. In this paper, an Arduino-based microcentrifuge was fabricated using a computer DVD (digital versatile disc) drive. The hardware part consisted of inexpensive mechanical and electronic parts such as the recycled parts of a computer DVD drive, an Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver, a magnetic sensor (for speed measurement), and a display. The microcentrifuge provided a wide speed range of 1,000-10,000 rpm. The fabrication process is easy, and the total fabrication cost of the fabricated microcentrifuge is less than $25. Since the fabricated microcentrifuge has open-source hardware and software parts, it is appropriate for educational purposes and laboratory settings.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is an important, rapidly emerging, manufacturing technology that takes the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) and builds parts in a layer-by-layer style. Thus, since the development of 3D printing, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most promising and inexpensive techniques for shaping free-form parts. It used a thermoplastic filament as a starting material to extrude, layer by layer, the suitable 3D object. It is assisted by a large community of developers, searchers, and users and with multiple free hardware and software open sources expanding the scope of its applications. However, in this process, printing objects with multi-materials and multicolors becomes a major challenge for most extrusion system of printing platforms. For example, in case it is required to print multi-material and multicolored parts, a high-quality head extruder should be used. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of proposing a new extruder system of printing parts with multicolors and materials. For this purpose, in the present paper, the different extrusion systems capable of printing parts with multicolors and materials were presented. The operating principle of each extrusion system is well explained through functional diagrams. Then, its advantages and disadvantages are cited. Finally, some prospects for improving these systems are presented and that will be the work of the next paper.

ID ATTENUATION; DEFORMATION; SEDIMENTS
AB OpenSWAP is a class of innovative open architecture, low cost autonomous vehicles for geological/geophysical studies of shallow water environments. Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems.

Light-sheet microscopy uses orthogonal illumination and detection to create a thin sheet of light which does not illuminate the sample outside of the depth of field of the detection axis.

AB Purpose: To implement a modular, flexible, open-source hardware configuration for parallel transmission (pTx) experiments on medical implant safety and to demonstrate real-time mitigation strategies for radio frequency (RF) induced implant heating based on sensor measurements.
   Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficientB1+for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domainE-field probes.
   Results: Repeatability and precision are similar to 3% forE-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, similar to 3% for temperature slopes and an similar to 6% root-mean-square deviation betweenB1+measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces theE-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with similar to 100 mu K resolution and similar to 14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode.
   Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing.

AB Overview In this article we frame the concept of a hardware-rich open source ecosystem (H-ROSE) that generates software and hardware components. In an H-ROSE, the designs of some components are accessible under open source licenses, while other component designs remain proprietary. We describe seven adoption factors used by the multinational French firm Thales to assess the efficacy of RISC-V to design processors. Other companies can use these adoption factors to explore whether an open hardware initiative supported by an H-ROSE is worthwhile.

AB Recently, Internet-based devices have evolved into platforms for new networks, with Internet of Things technology being applied in various areas. The expansion of scope of this technology and exchange of real-time information enables users to check their content whenever. The real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform has been developed to detect and monitor users in installed spaces. In this article, the real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform utilizes a non-contact sensor module and motion recovery printed circuit board module to quickly respond to emergency situations through real-time monitoring. This is visualized on the display by sending data extracted from the motion recovery printed circuit board module combined with open source hardware by the non-contact sensor module receiving information from smartphone users. The administrator's display continuously analyzes real-time moving objects by detecting them with respect to location coordinates and providing automatically recognized data to the cloud server. In addition, real-time Internet of Things motion detection monitoring system was configured to quickly respond to real-time alerts and effectively manage problems. Therefore, installing real-time Internet of Things motion detection platform at an actual site will enable quick resolving of emergency situations through information provision and user awareness monitoring.

AB Heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) monitoring is critical during surgeries and in intensive care units. Over the last decades, several studies have addressed noncontact monitoring of vital signs, but few reports have focused on SpO(2). This article presents an Heart rate and SpO(2) monitoring method without physical contact with the patient using imaging photoplethysmography. Eulerian video magnification (EVM) was employed in the proposed solution to amplify the changes in skin color due to the heart cycle. The developed software operates on a widely available, low-cost open hardware platform. Experiments were performed with nine healthy individuals. When comparing the experimental results to those obtained with a reference pulse oximeter, the proposed solution showed good accuracy in SpO(2) measurements, with a difference of less than 2%, meeting the requirements of the standard that regulates pulse oximetry equipment.

In addition to compelling benefits from using the Python language, PyMTL3 is designed to provide flexible, modular, and extensible workflows for both hardware designers and computer architects. PyMTL3 supports a seamless multilevel modeling environment and carefully designed modular software architecture using a sophisticated in-memory intermediate representation and a collection of passes that analyze, instrument, and transform PyMTL3 hardware models. We believe PyMTL3 can play an important role in jump-starting the open-source hardware ecosystem.

   Generators; Acceleration
AB RTL simulation is a critical tool for hardware design but its current slow speed often bottlenecks the whole design process. Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers.

AB The integration of large amounts of renewable energy will require multiterminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) grids to reliably transport the energy over long distances. However, before building an MTDC grid, a functional protection system design is needed. Realistic and industrial studies are required to validate the functionality of such a system. In addition, further academic research as well as education in the field are needed. This paper presents an open-source, low-cost protection intelligent electronic device (IED) prototype for use in a laboratory environment. In particular, the IED design, its fastest measured performance, example results for different fault scenarios, and an assessment of its use in education are shown. The open-source IED is useful to accelerate industrial and academic research, as well as to enable education in protection for MTDC grids.

AB In this work, we develop open source hardware and software for eye state classification and integrate it with a protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). We design and build the hardware using a reduced number of components and with a very low-cost. Moreover, we propose a method for the detection of open eyes (oE) and closed eyes (cE) states based on computing a power ratio between different frequency bands of the acquired signal. We compare several real- and complex-valued transformations combined with two decision strategies: a threshold-based method and a linear discriminant analysis. Simulation results show both classifier accuracies and their corresponding system delays.

AB Rational energy consumption in large buildings depends on both the users' consumption culture and the management systems implemented. In Colombia, few buildings have an energy management system characterized by its adaptability to the user and with a certain degree of intelligence. Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are "Things" with improved functionality, becoming "Smart Things" within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment.

AB Distributed digital manufacturing offers a solution to medical supply and technology shortages during pandemics. To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses.

AB This report describes a direction-dependent optical microscope operated with Raspberry Pi, with LED array illumination patterns controlled by Raspberry Pi. Images are obtained with a Raspberry Pi camera module. We demonstrate the use of Raspberry-Pi-based microscopes for multimodal imaging including bright-field microscopy, dark-field microscopy, differential phase-contrast microscopy, and polarization microscopy. We also demonstrate acquisition of direction-dependent dark-field and differential phase-contrast images. From a pair of opposite line or rectangular illumination, structures along the illumination axis were enhanced in dark-field images and differential phase-contrast images. Raspberry-Pi is open-source hardware. Raspberry-Pi-based compact, cost-effective, and multi-contrast microscopes are expected to be useful for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.

TI Low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive pressure support ventilator for
   under-resourced regions: open source hardware description, performance

SO EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL

ID BREATHING PATTERN; MECHANICAL VENTILATORS; ASSIST; HEALTH; BENCH
AB Aim: Current pricing of commercial mechanical ventilators in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) markedly restricts their availability, and consequently a considerable number of patients with acute/chronic respiratory failure cannot be adequately treated. Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs.
   Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients.
   Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cm H2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45 +/- 1.68 without support to 2.83 +/- 1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80 +/- 1.48; p=1.000).
   Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.

DE Open design; Collaborative design; Empirical study
AB Open source hardware has developed rapidly since the last 2 decades, thanks to access to Internet and availability of novel interactive manufacturing technologies (for example 3D printing or collaborative platforms). Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388-393, 2018) defined the "open-o-meter", i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project's process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects' process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project's process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project's process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations.

AB Free and open-source hardware (FOSH) is rapidly gaining momentum because it provides customized research hardware with over 90% savings compared to the costs of proprietary tools. However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84-27.7m(sic)/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed.

SO INDUSTRIAL ROBOT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH AND
   APPLICATION

DE Medical robots; Rehabilitation robots; Healthcare robots

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to design and develop a new robotic device for the rehabilitation of the upper limbs. The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report.
   Findings
   The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time.
   Research limitations/implications
   There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction.
   Practical implications
   Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices.
   Originality/value
   The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments.
   Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation.

AB The development of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has been a revolution for developmental biology as it allows long-term imaging during embryonic development. An important reason behind the quick adoption has been the availability of open hardware alternatives. In this work, we present a robust and compact version of a light-sheet fluorescence microscope that is easy to assemble and requires little to no maintenance. An important aspect of the design is that the illumination unit consists of reflective elements, thereby reducing chromatic aberrations an order of magnitude as compared to refractive counterparts.

AB In this work, the generation and posterior chemometric resolution of third-order data, obtained from samples processed by liquid chromatography (LC) with online registering of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEM) is reported. Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyze (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics.

ID EMERGENCE; NETWORK; DESIGN
AB Synthetic biology emerged in the USA and Europe twenty years ago and quickly developed innovative research and technology as a result of continued funding. Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early "MIT school" of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may be relevant to other developing countries.

AB In our modern world, many Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are being researched and developed. IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km(2)) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments.

AB With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.

TI A high-resolution polarimeter formed from inexpensive optical parts
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID ROTATORY DISPERSION; DFT
AB We describe a high resolution laser polarimeter built from commodity optical components. The optical rotation angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between two harmonically modulated polarised laser beams - an 'object beam' that passes through the sample under test and a 'reference beam' that bypasses the sample. The complete polarimeter may be assembled from low cost off-the-shelf parts for less than 300 pound (UK Sterling). Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of +/- 0.0013 degrees and a precision of +/- 0.0028 degrees - comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter's ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring. The polarimeter is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, and source code for its firmware included as Supplementary Information.

AB Accurate building energy assessments are often limited by inaccurate assumptions about the buildings' properties and occupant behavior. Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building.

AB This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF educational robot manipulator with a gripper. The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments presented in the paper.

AB Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.

AB With the global electricity demand witnessing a 3.1 percent jump in 2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Stretch is applied to cells by a specially designed elastomeric membrane with a central seeding region. The main interest of our approach is the fine control of the characteristics of stimulations in regard to timing and amplitude in a simple design based on affordable, easy to find components and 3D printable parts. Our approach opens the way to more complex protocols for electrical and/or mechanical stimulations, which are known important regulators of cardiac phenotypes. (C) 2020 Author(s).

AB An open-source syringe pump has been developed for use in the analytical laboratory. Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1%, and the random one was less than 3 mu L. Project files are available at: http://www.mass-spec.ru/projects/diy/syringe_pump/eng/..

AB The founding of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) vision was originally presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1188 (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 1999), after many years of discussions and workshops, described in detail by Filson and Arabasz (2016). Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to "... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies." In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning.

ID SYSTEM
AB In this study, applications of the Arduino platform in the mining industry were reviewed. Arduino, a representative and popular open-source hardware, can acquire information from various sensors, transmit data using communication technology, and control devices through actuators. The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future.

AB The control of refrigeration in the food chain is fundamental at all stages, with special emphasis on the retail stage. The implementation of information and communication technologies (IoT, open-source hardware and software, cloud computing, etc.) is representing a revolution in the operational paradigm of food control. This paper presents a low-cost IoT solution, based on free hardware and software, for monitoring the temperature in refrigerated retail cabinets. Specifically, the use of the ESP-8266-Wi-Fi microcontroller with DS18B20 temperature sensors is proposed. The ThingSpeak IoT platform is used to store and process data in the cloud. The solution presented is robust, affordable, and flexible, allowing to extend the scope of supervising other relevant parameters in the operating process (light control, energy efficiency, consumer presence, etc.).

AB Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL. Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences are suggested.

AB The sowing-fertilizing machines used in the mexican field use mechanical systems to drive the feeders. In developed countries, these systems are being replaced by mechatronic systems applied in variable dosing machines. Mechatronic systems have the advantage that their performance is not affected by the conditions of the soil and vegetation cover, in addition to the ease of making changes in the dose of input supplies, by allowing them to be carried out continuously and in real time. However, they have the disadvantage of their high acquisition cost. This study presents the laboratory test results of a mechatronic system developed with low-cost free hardware and software, and adapted to the Model LC-U-N seeder-fertilizer from the manufacturer Sembradoras del Bajio S. A de C. V. The seed dispenser was tested to the standard of the corn seed greased belt described in ISO 7256-1:1984. The results show good seed distribution quality at rotation frequencies of the seed disk of 0.524 to 2,199 rad s(-1), obtaining feeding quality indexes a 90%, seed loss and multiplicity less than 6 % and precision <18 %. The fertilizer and pesticide dispensers were tested based on the mexican standard NMX-0-222-SCFI-2004, with commercial UREA fertilizer, using five rotation frequencies in the range of 0.524 to 3.77 rad s(-1) and 1047 to 14,661 rad s(-1), respectively, with different openings of the outlet gate. In the case of the fertilizer dispenser, an application dose of 3 to 562 kg ha(-1) was obtained with the best performance when using gate openings 50 %, while the pesticide dispenser presented excellent performance, with which it was obtained an application rate of 0.004 to 16.4 kg ha(-1).

AB In his book Tools for Conviviality (1975), Ivan Illich calls for human self-limitation in technology development. His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called "self-learning", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by "artificial intelligence" can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation.

Data acquired at high-altitude stations reveal dangerous events of incident UV radiation reaching the Earth surface. Continuous multi-UV spectral measurements by open-source equipment could further deepen the knowledge of solar light propagation and the events of radiation transfer and atmospheric absorption processes. This report describes recent results on high-resolution UVA, UVB, UVC measurements of solar UV radiation at the mountain stations in Bulgaria.

AB Although telephony over IP protocol has more than a decade among us, the ubiquity of the Internet, new open hardware technologies, free software and cloud platforms invite us to rethink a solution in this new context. As such a solution is proposed in this project to Rill, made up of a small team to be installed in customer premises and an automatic provisioning system and telephone switching in the cloud. The main challenge for obtaining such a product was the large number of hardware and software components to be integrated, passing points as diverse as a Raspberry with its Grandstream interface adapter, Asterisk with its trunk and protocol contexts, platforms such as AWS and Docker. It is important to highlight that the stated objectives were achieved, obtaining a functional, resilient and scalable solution where complexity is centralized in the components hosted in the cloud. In this way, the benefits of virtualization and consolidation in the cloud have been extended to telephony in recent years. Finally, all the software components of the system are either free open source projects, or original developments by the authors of the same.

AB This research studied the feasibility in applying the flight controller of the unmanned aerial vehicle on a pontoon boat in fish farming industry. A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer.
   A 2(3) factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peak-to-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed.
   The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly.
   With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle.

AB Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization . In this paper, we investigate KM practices and needs in Open Source Hardware (OSH) communities. The aim is to provide insights into the KM issues and challenges facing these communities. Our analysis is based on interviews carried out with the participants of 22 projects. Interview transcriptions were coded and tagged with concepts extracted from the literature. Text mining was used to uncover the main concepts embedded in the corpus. From this analysis, knowledge sharing emerged as one of the top-rated concepts. Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations. High contributor turnover, little or no standardization and weak project structuring are still key challenges for OSH communities when it comes to ensuring awareness, making decisions and sharing knowledge.

AB Obstacle avoidance is an essential feature for autonomous robots. It is usually addressed with specialized sensors and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms (SLAM, Cadena et al. (2016)). Muller et al. (2006) have demonstrated that it can also be addressed using end-to-end deep learning. They proposed a convolutional neural network that maps raw stereo pair input images to steering outputs and is trained by a human driver in an outdoor setting. Using the ToyCollect open source hardware and software platform, we replicate their main findings, compare several variants of their network that differ in the way steering angles are represented, and extend their system to indoor obstacle avoidance. We discuss several issues for further work concerning the automated generation of training data and the quantitative evaluation of such systems.

AB This article presents the design and characterisation of a new low-power hardware platform to integrate unmanned aerial vehicle and wireless sensor technologies. In combination, these technologies can overcome data collection and maintenance problems of in situ monitoring in remote and extreme environments. Precision localisation in support of maximum efficiency mid-range inductive power transfer when recharging devices and increased throughput between drone and device are needed for data intensive monitoring applications, and to balance proximity time for devices powered by supercapacitors that recharge in seconds. The platform described in this article incorporates ultra-wideband technology to achieve high-performance ranging and high data throughput. It enables the development of a new localisation system that is experimentally shown to improve accuracy by around two orders of magnitude to 10 cm with respect to GNSS and achieves almost 6 Mbps throughput in both lab and field conditions. These results are supported by extensive modelling and analysis. The platform is designed for application flexibility, and therefore includes a wide range of sensors and expansion possibilities, with source code for two applications made immediately available as part of a open source project to support research and development in this new area.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Multi-/Many-core architectures are emerging as scalable, high-performance and energy-efficient computing platforms suitable for a variety of application domains from edge to cloud computing. Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability.

AB Soil is the base of agriculture. Soil provides nutrients that increase the growth of a crop. Some chemical and physical properties of soil, such as its moisture, temperature and its pH, heavily affect the yield of a crop. These properties can be sensed by the open-source hardware, and they can be used in the field. In this chapter, a soil health monitoring system is proposed in which farmer will be able to monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and soil pH in his android smart-phone. The farmer will also get the recommendations of lime and sulphur on the basis of pH of the soil. The area of study is Jaipur, Rajasthan (26.9124 degrees N, 75.7873 degrees E). The proposed system is tested with the results taken from authorized laboratories. The proposed system is validated with t-test having no significance difference between calibrated values and laboratory-recorded values. The proposed system is implemented on android smartphone so it is useful for farmers, agriculture scientists, agriculture professionals and IoT experts.

AB Background: Digital radiography devices are still the gold standard for diagnosis or therapy guidance in medicine. Despite the similarities between all direct digital x-ray systems, researchers and new companies face significant challenges during the development phase of innovative x-ray devices; each component is manufactured independently, guidance towards device integration from manufacturers is limited, global standards for device integration is lacking. Method: In scope of this study a plug-integrate-play (PIP) conceptual model for x-ray imaging system is introduced and implemented as an open hardware platform, SyncBox. The researchers are free to select each individual device component from different vendors based on their intended application and target performance are utilized in criteria. Result: As its first implementation, SyncBox and its platform a full body high resolution radiographic scanner that employs a novel TDI digital detector. Conclusion: We believe that SyncBox has a potential for introducing an open source hardware platform to x-ray equipment design.

AB The increased popularity of investigations and exploits in the fields of neurological rehabilitation, human emotion recognition, and other relevant brain-computer interfaces demand the need for fiexible electrophysiology data acquisition systems. Such systems often require to be multi-modal and multi-channel capable of acquiring and processing several different types of physiological signals simultaneously in realtime. Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the entire chain of the HiCCE-128 electrophysiological data acquisition system. The system comprises of 128 independent channels capable of acquiring signal at 31.25 kHz, with 16 effective bits per channel with a measured noise level of about 3 fiV. The reliability and feasibility of the implemented system have been confirmed through a series of tests and real-world applications. The modular design methodology based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) standard allows the connection of the HiCCE-128 board to programmable system-on-chip carrier devices through the high-speed FMC link. The implemented architecture enables end users to add various high-response electrophysiological signal processing techniques in the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) part of the system on chip (SoC) device on each channel in parallel according to application specification.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to argue in favor of the open hardware philosophy (open-source hardware - OSH) as a technological innovation and academic entrepreneurshipmodel in Brazil.
   Design/methodology/approach - This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process.
   Findings - As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education.
   Research limitations/implications - There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models.
   Originality/value - The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature.

AB Heterogeneous architectures and heterogeneous-ISA designs are growing areas of computer architecture and system software research. Unfortunately, this line of research is significantly hindered by the lack of experimental systems and modifiable hardware frameworks. This work proposes BYOC, a "Bring Your Own Core" framework that is specifically designed to enable heterogeneous-ISA and heterogeneous system research. BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system. BYOC is well suited to be the premiere platform for heterogeneous-ISA architecture, system software, and compiler research.

ID SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MICROPHONE ARRAY; NETWORKS
AB We propose an open source hardware platform called Blinky, a sound-to-light conversion sensor that harvests sound power at low-rate and conveniently. Blinkies are made up of a central processing unit connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure. Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment. Finally, we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual Blinkies in highly reverberent environment.

AB The internet of things is rapidly becoming a fact of life. There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company.

ID FIELD-ORIENTED CONTROL
AB Open-source designs are being increasingly used to develop robot hardware. When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems.

AB The success of many open source software projects revealed the power of voluntary collaborative production of large/complex software systems. The research community is therefore curious about the viability of open source projects in other areas. In around 2000, open source practices started to take place in the commercial hardware realm, and so far, the phenomenon has not been fully explored. Using grounded theory, the authors studied 31 firms for an average of 2.3 years, discovering a 4-phase growth pattern of open source hardware firms, including starting the firm, identifying core competencies, business model improvement and business maturation. The firms' behaviors in each stage are reported, as well as the evolution of community demography, behaviors and impact in different growth phases.

AB Recent advancements in whole slide imaging (WSI) have moved pathology closer to digital practice. Existing systems require precise mechanical control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists. Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI. The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of similar to 0.7 mu m. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm(2) region in similar to 2 mins with throughput comparable to existing high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly available and utilizable without loss of capacity.

AB Open source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) are two expressions of one broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.

AB Building novel analytical systems requires various elements: Sensors, a sampling system and data evaluation software. For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: "LABI-Imaging" for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and "RmsiGUI", a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers' community.

TI Parametric CAD modeling for open source scientific hardware: Comparing
   OpenSCAD and FreeCAD Python scripts
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INNOVATION
AB Open source hardware for scientific equipment needs to provide source files and enough documentation to allow the study, replication and modification of the design. In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment.

AB In order to accelerate deployment of distributed recycling by providing low-cost feed stocks of granulated post-consumer waste plastic, this study analyzes an open source waste plastic granulator system. It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business-based distributed recycling.

AB As conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy generally produce images with blurring at the upper and lower planes along the z-axis due to non-focal plane image information, the observation of biological images requires "deconvolution." Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software. Although this system does not utilize expensive equipment, such as confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes, decent images can be obtained even without previous experience in electronics and optics.

AB In this article we present a new low-cost physiological signal acquisition platform in compliance with Open-Source Hardware philosophy. The device contains an electrocardiography circuit; two electrodermal activity channels that implement a time-multiplexing technique to remove inter-channel coupling interference; and a skin temperature module. These features make the platform suitable for experiments involving Affective Computing. We have assessed the performance of this device in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Background Noise Level (BNL), an adapted MPEG7 feature for electrocardiography signals. This platform outperforms other commercial devices and most similar state-of-art studies on SNR. Results show values of 11.96, 30.01, 68.40 dB for ECG, EDA and ST, respectively, for SNR, and -28.31 dB for BNL in ECG. Both features were obtained by sampling physiological signals at a frequency of 256 Hz.

TI OpenPiton: An Open Source Hardware Platform For Your Research
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
LA English
DT Article
ID PROCESSOR
AB Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings.

AB Large scale deployment of Smart Grids (SGs) and Smart Micro-Grids (SMGs) requires overcoming problems related to interoperability and high costs. To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are reported.

The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the "Arduino" open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners.

AB Tissue decellularization for generating extracellular matrices has become a staple of regenerative medicine in the recent decades, extending from the research setting to clinical usage. Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Impact Statement Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering.

AB Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the low-cost of high performance optoelectronic and robotics components has supported a resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. We describe a low cost (below $700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed 'lab-on-a-comb' to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of similar to 420 x 300mm, which allows 29 'lab-on-a-comb' devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1 mu l samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes.

AB This paper presents an intelligent electronic device (IED) utilized for automatic meter readings (AMR) scheme using "Open-Source" software. This IED is utilized to measure a low-voltage intelligent electronic device) system with a boundless number of sensors, and it is accessible on the Internet of Things (IoT). The utilized equipment for this task is Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and fringe sensors, which are used for measurement of the referenced information. The Arduino motherboard is used not only for sole tranquility of equipment but also for serving as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) switch for the sensors. The personal computer is utilized to gather information and perform client-side calculations. The server works based on an open-source program written in Java programming language. The underlying objective of the proposed scheme is to make the meter based on the "Do It Yourself" methodology which requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of measured information and convenience for the conclusive client. The information is measured in just about 1 ms which is superb for custom-designed IED. Furthermore, the measured qualities are calculated based on their RMS values to be used for analyzing and further presentation of data.

AB A wide range of medical devices have significant electronic components. Compared to open-source medical software, open (and open-source) electronic hardware has been less published in peer-reviewed literature. In this review, we explore the developments, significance, and advantages of using open platform electronic hardware for medical devices. Open hardware electronics platforms offer not just shorter development times, reduced costs, and customization; they also offer a key potential advantage which current commercial medical devices lack-seamless data sharing for machine learning and artificial intelligence. We explore how various electronic platforms such as microcontrollers, single board computers, field programmable gate arrays, development boards, and integrated circuits have been used by researchers to design medical devices. Researchers interested in designing low cost, customizable, and innovative medical devices can find references to various easily available electronic components as well as design methodologies to integrate those components for a successful design.

AB Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states.

AB Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data.
   In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ARCHITECTURES
AB In order to provide dynamic adaptation of the performance/energy tradeoff, systems today rely on heterogeneous multicore architectures (different micro-architectures on a chip). These systems are limited to single-ISA approaches to enable transparent migration between the different cores. To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software equivalent. The impact on the total execution time of applications and the quality of generated binaries are also measured.

AB Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person households, it is absolutely necessary to observe the indoor activities of marginalized people, such as the elderly or the disabled, to detect abnormal conditions. At this time, contact sensors are have limited applicability due to their continuous wear, so there is a need to develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing management prescription guidelines through risk detection.

AB Quality assurance detectors comprising cameras and a scintillator volume are of interest for use in spot scanning proton therapy due to its dynamic delivery. In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% +/- 0.4% for low SNR (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future.

AB This work demonstrates an open-source hardware and software platform for monitoring the performance of buildings, called Elemental, that is designed to provide data on indoor environmental quality, energy usage, HVAC operation, and other factors to its users. It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building.

AB This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on 'open design' in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including 'open hardware'): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself 'making,' manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.

TI Makerspaces on Social Media: Shaping Access to Open Design
SO HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
ID FACEBOOK
AB Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software, and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces' social media presence serve as the 'front door' for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different 'front doors' of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces' social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces' social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces' social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and differences between makerspaces' social media presences in the same geographical region have the strength of producing different identities across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential participation in Open Design.

AB Measuring ingestive behavior of liquids in rodents is commonly used in studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications.

AB The housing crisis has received growing interest from academia, industry, and policymakers. Open construction systems have emerged as a promising solution to achieve long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In this paper, extensive fieldwork was conducted to investigate a case of an open construction system, namely, the WikiHouse Den Bosch. The research framework builds on a combined view of two main concepts: conviviality and openness. The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two aspects and the literature regarding Design Global Manufacture Local. The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and context-specific factors. The paper concludes by outlining the need for an institutionalized conviviality to open up new pathways for future practice to address sustainability issues.

AB Data collection by conservation biologists is undergoing radical change, with researchers collaborating across disciplines to create bespoke, low-cost monitoring equipment from open-source hardware (OSH). Compared to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs. Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3) lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action.

AB The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics.

AB The use of animal-borne devices in wildlife studies is increasing due to the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs. Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present 'OpenDropOff', an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices.

AB We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid/liquid separator constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The separator - whose performance is competitive with far costlier commercial systems - is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for its firmware.

ID CUP ANEMOMETER; SPEED; PERFORMANCE
AB In all studies involving wind speed, such as meteorology, wind turbines and agriculture accurate speed information for decision making is required. There are several types of anemometers, with medium and high costs, such as cup, hot wire and pitot tubes, the hot wire being more sensitive and expensive than others. The device developed in this work is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US$ 50.00, using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer. The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments. As the reference anemometer (IPMet) has high embedded technology and the prototype is low cost, we conclude that the project has an attractive cost benefit for possible development and production, reaching the objective of this work.

AB Azimuthal beam scanning eliminates the uneven excitation field arising from laser interference in through-objective total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF.

AB In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of an open hardware-software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also support the suitability of the proposed platform.

AB The majority of bird and bat species are incapable of carrying tags that transmit their position to satellites. Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines.

AB Open-source technology for supporting the Industry 4.0 has become the target of academic research in many sectors. This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors.

AB In the era of technological advances and innovations in transportation technologies, application of driving simulators for the investigation and assessment of the driving process provides a safe and suitable testing environment. Although driving simulators are crucial for further improvements in transportation, it is important to resolve one of their main disadvantages-simulator sickness. Therefore, suitable methods for the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity-electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals.

AB Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are growing simultaneously. These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via 'HTTP requests' for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001% which proves its applicability in healthcare.

TI A low-cost autonomous rover for polar science
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOTOGRAMMETRY; ROBOT
AB We present the developmental considerations, design, and deployment of an autonomous modular terrestrial rover for ice-sheet exploration that is inexpensive, easy to construct, and allows for instrumentation customization. The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions.

AB Mobile robots are playing a significant role in Higher Education science and engineering teaching, as they offer a flexible platform to explore and teach a wide-range of topics such as mechanics, electronics and software. Unfortunately the widespread adoption is limited by their high cost and the complexity of user interfaces and programming tools. To overcome these issues, a new affordable, adaptable and easy-to-use robotic platform is proposed. Mona is a low-cost, open-source and open-hardware mobile robot, which has been developed to be compatible with a number of standard programming environments. The robot has been successfully used for both education and research at The University of Manchester, UK.

AB An automated method based on open-source hardware was created for the separation of porphyrins fractions from crude oil, an essential step for the quantification of V and Ni as metalloporphyrins. Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V). The overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds.

DE open-source; in situ-sensing; arduino; lora; google-sheet; data-logging;

AB In Earth science, we must often collect data from sensors installed in remote locations. Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries' open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer.

ID SYSTEM
AB Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs) have shown promising potential in mobile 3-dimensional grasping applications, but they still suffer from some difficulties impeding their board applications, such as target detection and indoor positioning. For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation tasks.

DE emergency response; terrestrial robotics; wheeled robots
AB European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots is an outdoor robotics contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater, and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks (similar to 83% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored with the Creativity Award "for building a land robot from scratch in less than 2 days when their ground platform broke."

AB Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization is one of the most promising approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption.

AB Recent advances in smartphones and affordable open-source hardware platforms have enabled the development of low-cost architectures for Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled home automation and security systems. These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices.

AB This paper presents an open source framework called Creamino. It consists of an Arduino-based cost-effective quick-setup EEG platform built with off-the-shelf components and a set of software modules that easily allow users to connect this system to Simulink or BCI-oriented tools (such as BCI2000 or OpenViBE) and set up a wide number of neuroscientific experiments. Creamino is capable of processing multiple EEG channels in real-time and operates under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X in real-time on a standard PC. Its objective is to provide a system that can be readily fabricated and used for neurophysiological experiments and, at the same time, can serve as the basis for development of novel BCI platforms by accessing and modifying its open source hardware and software libraries. Schematics, gerber files, bill of materials, source code, software modules, demonstration videos, and instructions on how to use these modules are available free of charge for research and educational purposes online at https://github.com/ArcesUnibo/creamino. Application cases show how the system can be used for neuroscientific or BCI experiments. Thanks to its low production cost and its compatibility with open-source BCI tools, the system presented is particularly suitable for use in BCI research and educational applications.

Due to the current system limitations regarding costs and operational problems, a new approach based on low cost, computer vision open hardware and deep learning has been developed. The preliminary tests carried out successfully in Plataforma solar de Almeria (PSA), reveal the great potential and show the new approach as a good alternative to traditional systems. The proposed approach can provide key variables for the Sun tracking system control like cloud movements prediction, block and shadow detection, atmospheric attenuation or measures of concentrated solar radiation, which can improve the control strategies of the system and therefore the system performance.

AB Fiber photometry is the process of recording bulk neural activity by measuring fluorescence changes in activity sensitive indicators such as GCaMP through an optical fiber. We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users.

AB This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development. Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce. Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for specific monitoring applications and working environments.

AB This paper characterizes and explores a corporate strategy in which downstream firms collaborate to develop open substitute designs for proprietary hardware they would otherwise purchase from upstream suppliers. This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This "scale-stealing" mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.

AB This article presents an innovative and low-cost solution for optimizing the acquisition of performance data of small-laboratory-scale photovoltaic devices. A novel measuring setup is proposed, designed based on an Arduino microcontroller and low-cost components, coupled with open source hardware and software. The manuscript describes in detail the instrument design, components and assembly enabling the reproduction and customization of the instrument for any reader. The setup is combined with an optional web-platform, which enables fast analysis and comparison of the collected data.
   For the demonstration of the instrument in operation, comparison of measurements of solar cell with the developed setup and commercial products has been conducted. It is shown that the presented prototype provides values of accuracy and precision during I-V curve recording, comparable with the values measured using a commercial source-meter (Keithley 2400). The study also discusses the unique advantages of easy transport and data collection by the setup and the drawbacks in the hardware, which have been observed during a round robin study.

AB Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.

AB IoT is much more than a large number of objects or customer devices connected to the Internet. IoT offers organizations many more opportunities than they can imagine. According to this, sooner or later they will probably choose to build their own IoT network. In this article, we review the technologies of IoT LPWAN Sigfox and LoRa. It can be considered the most important at present due to its ability to make the smart city possible. We also propose the development, deployment and implementation of a mixed IoT architecture LoRa-Sigfox composed of components based on open hardware and software. The architecture is evaluated in a real environment focused on remote monitoring of water meter devices.

AB An important challenge for our society is the transformation of traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) provides the ability to digitize physical objects into virtual data, thanks to the integration of hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators) and network communications for collecting and exchanging data. In this digitization process, however, security challenges need to be taken into account in order to prevent information availability, integrity, and confidentiality from being compromised. In this paper, security challenges of two broadly used technologies, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and Bluetooth, are analyzed. First, a review of the main vulnerabilities, security risk, and threats affecting both technologies are carried out. Then, open hardware and open source tools like: Proxmark3 and Ubertooth as well as BtleJuice and Bleah are used as part of the practical analysis. Lastly, risk mitigation and counter measures are proposed.

AB Combining fluorescence and transmitted light sources for microscopy is an invaluable method in cellular neuroscience to probe the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cells. This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day.

AB Background: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil.
   New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil.
   Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination.
   Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.

AB The purpose of this document is to evaluate the implementation of technology to the hydroponics technique. Knowing that classical cultivation requires the permanent care of the human being for the irrigation of water and tender of the nutritive solution, it is proposed to use technology to replace the basic functions of crop irrigation through the use of programmable and reprogrammable microcontrollers, thus following the free hardware culture, this paper evaluates a scalable system with sensors, an open source hardware and software platform to interact between analog and digital signals. Within the steps that comprehend the realization of the project, the methodology based on components, provides the appropriate guidance for the analysis and choice of hardware, thus allowing the integration of the electronic components to work along with the appropriate coding; as a result the project will collect the pH value present in the nutrient solution, if the value is not adequate, it will automatically activate the insertion of the solution to the container reservoir, to subsequently operate the automated water irrigation for hydroponic farming. Another relevant aspect is that the project can be improved with other devices that will allow an even greater control of variables and data of hydroponics crops.

AB The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the advantages of computer network have attracted the attention of technological experts. However, network security issues remain a challenge. Controlling Web traffic and preventing attack to Web server, especially DoS/DDoS, are tremendous in the current computing ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a solution for controlling connections of the inside as well as the outside of network systems by using an integrated hardware, which would be deployed at gateway of the networks. It is not only used to implement rules but also monitor the network traffic, especially for web traffic which is considered as the common type in the Internet. In our solution, we prefer to use the IP SLA to control the web traffic, rather proxy to set up rules as well as a data stream algorithm for fast detecting Hot-IPs to prevent attacks from outside networks to the inside servers. The proposed solution is trouble-free to use and enhance security in small & medium networks as well.

AB In this paper, the authors design a wearable gesture recognition system that identifies the alphabetic gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) efficiently, requiring minimal user calibration. The system uses a heterogeneous collection of sensors, viz., contact, flex and inertial, placed strategically on the hand to record movements and points of contact involved during gesture signing. In order to minimize user calibration, the authors propose a novel approach called as State-based gesture modelling, which requires only 7 gestures to be signed by a user to create a State-based model for all 26 alphabetic gestures in ASL for that user. A multi-stage gesture recognition algorithm, which uses the user-calibrated State-based model, is employed for gesture identification. The system was extensively tested for 2 trained and 1 amateur ASL signers for up to 150 times per gesture giving maximum efficiencies of 92% and 81% respectively, thus indicating the robustness of the system. The use of an elegant algorithm along with simple off-the-shelf sensors enabled the implementation of the entire system on an ATmega 328P microcontroller, resulting in a cost of 25 USD for a laboratory stage prototype.

AB During the last decade, many climatic parameters are more and more deviating from the mean values calculated over historical climatic time-series. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest since 1850. According to the preliminary data analysis of the last year, this trend is going to continue in 2018 as well. These climatic changes have accelerated the occurrence of droughts in many parts of the world including Europe and Asia. The North Western region is one such region in Sri Lanka which always affected by droughts due to its inherent dry weather condition. Although drought is considered as a normal part of the climate, its increasing negative impacts on human activities and the environment urges the application of novel technologies in drought monitoring. The 4onse project (analysis of Open, Non-conventional, Sustainable and Effective monitoring systems), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), is a project began in this context to address the aforementioned mentioned issues by deploying 27 open technologies based Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) in Deduru Oya basin of Sri Lanka. These systems measure weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. Thanks to the collected data, it was possible to calculate some drought indexes to evaluate the intensity of the dry periods. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) has been selected as the principal indicator to evaluate droughts by integrating the 4onse data together with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset.

AB With regard to the growing number of older adults, it needs smart solutions for fall prevention. Especially at geriatric institutions, the risk of falling is very high and frequently leads to injuries, resulting in serious consequences. We present the Inexpensive Node for Bed Exit Detection (INBED), a comprehensive signaling system for fall prevention. The INBED system is based on a wireless sensor network infrastructure via IEEE802.15.4 and highly-specialized open hardware in-house developed wearable. The device, which will be attached to the patients, can detect several types of movement. Occurring events are forwarded to the nursing staff immediately by using the self-organizing and scalable network including wide area network integration. The system can help to relieve the staff while the personal freedom of movement and privacy of patients is increased. With this development, the energy-efficient, simple and intuitive mechanisms of proximity communication can be combined with broadband benefits.

AB Control and monitoring of experimental facilities as well as laboratory equipment requires handling a blend of different tasks. Often in industrial or scientific fields there are standards or form factor to comply with and electronic interfaces or custom busses to adopt. With such tight boundary conditions, the integration of an off-the-shelf Single Board Computer (SBC) is not always a possible or viable alternative. The availability of electronic schematics and PCBs with open-source Hardware license for various SBCs overcomes such integration problems, making feasible the implementation of a custom architecture composed by a central core inherited from a vendor reference design (most likely the microprocessor, static RAM and flash memory) augmented with application-specific integrated circuits and hardware resources, in order to handle the requirements of the specific environment. The user is then able to exploit most of the supported tools and software provided by open-source community, fulfilling all the constraints enforced by his environment. We have used such an approach for the design and development of the monitoring system of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II experiment, presently running at KEK Laboratory (Tsukuba, Japan). Here we present and discuss the main aspects of the hardware architectures and noise performances tailored on the needs of a detector designed around CsI crystal scintillators.

AB Modern innovative concepts around Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICTs), like Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things or Smart Grids, are impacting the scientific and technological worlds and, hence, in control and automation arenas. These trends involve networked interconnection and continuous data flow between a number of hardware and software actors. In parallel, open source technology has gained increasing attention from last years, especially due to the widespread presence of the open source hardware Arduino microcontroller. Focusing on industrial advanced frameworks, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are required to exchange data with new smart devices, sensors and/or actuators. Arduino boards are commonly used as development platforms for such smart devices. Therefore, communication solutions must be designed towards the convergence of open source hardware and widely used traditional SCADA-devoted software. This paper presents a system that seamlessly integrates Arduino boards into a LabVIEW-based SCADA system through Ethernet connection. The open connectivity provided by the Open Platform Communications (OPC) protocol enables such integration. The proposed framework is a novelty in scientific literature. The development of the system is reported and initial results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.

ID EMERGENCY
AB Humanitarian response often addresses the basic human needs which include safe, sanitary, hazard free environment. From the war torn countries to remote communities, untreated household waste water creates living conditions directly affecting human welfare. We present an IoT enabled, semi industrial, mobile waste water treatment solution targeted for communities in remote sub-Arctic regions without a centralized sewer system or a waste water treatment facility. The open source hardware and software platforms were implemented on an Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi to operate a household water reuse system. The water reuse system was developed as part of the Alaska Water and Sewer Challenge to address a cost effective alternative to piped water and sewer service in unserved remote Alaskan Communities. The semi-industrial water treatment system was controlled using the internet enabled Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi components-off-the-shelf (COTS) that allowed for both on-site and remote control. While implemented as a proof-of-concept of a treatment system to evaluate existing waste water technology, the production model can take full advantage of the internet of things concepts that would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, optimized treatment time to meet available community electrical loads, and remote troubleshooting and operation to name a few.

AB Recently, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have gained an important research relevance as a mean of transport efficient and sustainable. In this full research to practice paper, we expose the educational experience to develop the different nodes such as lighting system, driver-focused Human Machine Interface (HMI), battery balancing and air conditioning with solar panels for EOLO, the first Colombian (EV) with an additional system of charge through wind for the auxiliary batteries which guarantees the autonomy of the vehicle. Twelve students (n=12) have been enrolled into the methodology of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to design and implement the mentioned nodes as part of a set of capstone projects. To technical level, each node has been designed using Digital Signal Controllers (dsPICs), the open hardware platform Arduino or FTDI 32-bit microcontrollers as the FT900Q according to the design requirements. Also, it has designed several educational materials in the e-learning tool Xerte and an Algorithm Visualization (AV) tool called DSCBlocks that supported the educational process of the students. The outcomes show that the methodology is suitable to fulfill with the technical and educational requirements of the projects because they enclosed different stages such as problem definition, design strategy, usage of previous knowledge, implementation, debugging and team working. In addition, an assessment of the educational methodology is provided in the manuscript with the discussion of its implications for learning in the students.

AB With the Internet-of-Things revolution, the security assessment against implementation attacks has become a critical concern not only for hardware accelerators but also for embedded CPUs executing cryptographic primitives. Starting from an FPGA implementation of the open-hardware ORPSoC system-on-chip running a software version of the AES, this paper explores two implications of the side-channel information leakage that impact the hardware design of general purpose computing platforms. First, we explore the mapping between the side-channel information leakage and the microarchitectural components that are contributing to it. Second, we discuss the variations in the observability of the side-channel information leakage at post-synthesis and post-implementation levels of the FPGA hardware design flow.

AB The power efficiency of photovoltaic modules is highly correlated with their health status. Under dynamically changing environments, photovoltaic defects could spontaneously form and develop into fatal faults during the daily operation of photovoltaic plants. To facilitate defect detection with less human intervention, a non-destructive and contactless visual inspection system with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and edge computing is proposed in this work. Limited by the resources of edge devices and the availability of images of photovoltaic defects for training, we developed an online solution combined with deep learning, data argumentation and transfer learning to properly address the issues of running resource hungry applications on edge devices and lack of training samples faced by the deep learning approaches used in the field. With the reduction of the network depth of the deep convolutional neural network model and the transfer of features from the learned defects, the resource consumption of our proposed approach is significantly reduced, and thus can be used on a wide range of edge devices to complete defect detection in a timely manner with high accuracy. To study the performance of our design, a testbed was built from open source hardware and software, and field trials were carried out in three photovoltaic plants. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our design for detecting visible defects on photovoltaic modules.

ID DESIGN; PLATFORM
AB This paper provides the design of a novel open-hardware mini-bipedal robot, named Rapid-Prototyped Remote-Brain BiPed (RPRP), that is developed to provide a low-cost and reliable platform for locomotion and perception research. The robot is made of customized 3D-printed material (ABS plastic) and electronics, and commercial Robotics Dynamixel MX-28 actuators, as well as visual RGB-D and MU sensing systems. We show that the robot is able to perform some locomotion/visual-odometry tasks and it is easy to switch between different feet designs, providing also a novel Center-of-Pressure (CoP) sensing system, so that it can deal with various types of terrain. Moreover, we provide a description of its control and perception system architecture, as well as our open source software packages that provide sensing and navigation tools for locomotion and visual odometry on the robot. Finally, we briefly discuss the transferability of some prototype research that has been done on the developed mini-biped, to half or full-size humanoid robots, such as COMAN or WALK-MAN.

AB In recent years, quadcopters have become popular research platforms in the fields of robotics and control engineering. As a response to the academic community's needs, several open-source hardware and software platforms have emerged with the aim to impose as de-facto development tools. One of these platforms is represented by Crazyflie 2.0, a nano class quadcopter that was used in research projects that span from control architecture designs to high-level swarm synchronization.
   This paper presents a study of the control architecture employed in the stock firmware. Based on the mathematical model, the dynamic behaviour is thoroughly evaluated to understand the deviation between ideal and real evolution. A comprehensive phase of parameters tuning is conducted and multiple scenarios for real-time testing are employed. These scenarios comply in tracking predefined patterns, the quadcopter's evolution being tracked via a RGB-D sensor.
   The proposed evaluation procedure can be easily replicated and represents a very important step in obtaining accurate real-time results.

AB Swarm robotics is a relatively new research field that employs multiple robots (tens, hundreds or even thousands) that collaborate on complex tasks. There are several issues which limit the realworld application of swarm robotic scenarios, e.g. autonomy time, communication methods, and cost of commercialised robots. We present a platform, which aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations while using off-the-shelf components and freely-available software. The platform combines (i) a versatile open-hardware micro-robot capable of local and global communication, (ii) commercially-available wireless charging modules which provide virtually unlimited robot operation time, (iii) open-source marker-based robot tracking system for automated experiment evaluation, (iv) and a LCD display or a light projector to simulate environmental cues and pheromone communication. To demonstrate the versatility of the system, we present several scenarios, where our system was used.

AB This paper describes the design, manufacture, and performance of a highly dexterous, low-profile, 7 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robotic arm for CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy. Direct CT guidance allows physicians to localize tumours quickly; however, needle insertion is still performed by hand. This system is mounted to a fully active motion stage superior to the patient's head and teleoperated by a radiologist. Unlike other similar robots, this robot's fully serial-link approach uses a unique combination of belt and cable drives for high-transparency and minimal-backlash, allowing for an expansive working area and numerous approach angles to targets, all while maintaining a small in-bore cross-section of less than 16cm(2). Simulations verified the system's expansive collision free work-space and ability to hit targets across the entire chest, as required for lung cancer biopsy. Targeting error was on average < 1mm on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. While this system was developed for lung biopsies, it can be easily modified for other CT-guided needle based procedures. Additionally, this system is open-hardware.(1)

AB We present RoFICoM, a new retractable connection device that allows for mechanical, electric, and data communication connection between separable robotic modules. The device is intentionally designed to be used in lattice-type metamorphic robots, however, its applicability is much wider. The main novelty of our solution lies primarily in a new unique flat design and spatial compactness of the connector. With a flat connector, much more space is left for the body of a robotic module in the structure. Moreover, the connector is also fully self-contained device with well defined mechanical, electrical and data interfaces, hence it can be easily embedded in various robotic solutions. Our RoFICoM connector is easy to produce, it is open-hardware and free for non-commercial use. In the paper, we give construction details and report on a couple of experiments we performed to demonstrate key features of the connection achieved with two RoFICoM devices.

AB Keeping an algal culture at a constant turbidity requires expensive and complex devices. We designed a low-cost, user friendly but also highly configurable phototurbidostat using 3D-printing, open-source software and electronics. The device is able to monitor in real time a culture in photobioreactor, and dynamically adjust the conditions to maintain the turbidity at a desired value. It can accommodate to a large set of volumes or laboratory equipments with little effort thanks to its modular and scalable design. Each module (such as light, pumps or sensors) are autonomous and controllable via Wi-Fi. Furthermore, our phototurbidostat is fully open-source and can be remotely controlled by a smartphone or a computer via a web-based graphical user interface. Finally, the device can be reproduced easily for a cost ranging between 1/20th and 1/50th of the price of a classical commercial device.

AB Two main approaches are currently prevalent in the digital emulation of musical instruments: manipulation of pre-recorded samples and techniques of real-time synthesis, generally based on physical models with varying degrees of accuracy. Concerning the first, while the processing power of present-day computers enables their use in real-time, many restrictions arising from this sample-based design persist; the huge on disk space requirements and the stiffness of musical articulations being the most prominent. On the other side of the spectrum, pure synthesis approaches, while offering greater flexibility, fail to capture and reproduce certain nuances central to the verisimilitude of the generated sound, offering a dry, synthetic output, at a high computational cost. We propose a method where ensembles of lightweight neural networks working in parallel are learned, from crafted frequency-domain features of an instrument sound spectra, an arbitrary instrument's voice and articulations realistically and efficiently. We find that our method, while retaining perceptual sound quality on par with sampled approaches, exhibits 1/10 of latency times of industry standard real-time synthesis algorithms, and 1/100 of the disk space requirements of industry standard sample-based digital musical instruments. This method can, therefore, serve as a basis for more efficient implementations in dedicated devices, such as keyboards and electronic drumkits and in general purpose platforms, like desktops and tablets or open-source hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From a conceptual point of view, this work highlights the advantages of a closer integration of machine learning with other subjects, especially in the endeavor of new product development. Exploiting the synergy between neural networks, digital signal processing techniques and physical modelling, we illustrate the proposed method via the implementation of two virtual instruments: a conventional grand piano and a hibrid stringed instrument.

AB This work studied different digital embedded platforms which can be programmed using Arduino IDE software and which can be used for digital control and data acquisition applications. Specifically three kind of Arduino Board (Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega y Arduino Due) and two ESP based board (ESP8622 and ESP32) are evaluated and compared. The comparison is based on the execution time of mathematical operations and a function required for data acquisition or digital control and includes (z) digital ports writing, (ii) analog signal acquisition, (iii) execution of mathematic operation in integer and float format, and (iv) the execution of the data processing code. The execution time is measured by using a methodology which is simple to implement for any other digital device. Because of each platform uses its own Arduino DUE library to generate the assembly code for its own microcontroller, the instructions adopted for both generating the actions to measure and generating the testing signals are written using Arduino IDE commands and using instructions that any entry-level user may adopt. In conclusion, from the experimental results it is observed the high difference in the execution time of the different platforms, especially between ESPx boards and Arduino boards.

AB Arduino is an open-source hardware and software single-board microcontroller for building digital devices and interactive objects. Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form or as do-it-yourself kits. The price of the board is relatively low, which is a key advantage for educational purposes.
   The current paper describes the experiences about the use of an Arduino-based device in the chemical lab for temperature and pH monitoring and remote data logging. Furthermore, the capability of the Arduino was used to implement an automatic microcontroller for the experiment's temperature and pH. The assembled device was designed for monitoring and control chemical processes that require pH and temperature control, such as e.g. a chemical reaction carried out in a continuous stirred-tank reactor.
   The pH is controlled by the addition of acid or base to the reaction mixture. When the device detects that the pH is beyond or below certain pre-defined threshold limits, it activates electro-valves that inject the controlling substance to the system. Temperature control was designed for both exothermic and endothermic processes, using heaters and fans as well as controlling the flow of a refrigeration jacket.
   The practical exercise of assembling the microcontroller had good acceptance from the students, who had to practice multidisciplinary skills, such as programming, electronics, chemistry, chemical engineering and design of experiments. A calibration procedure was included to increase the reliability of the results, which also helped to consolidate the theoretical aspects of analytical chemistry and experiments control.

AB There is a growing interest in the open-source hardware movement to amortize non-recurring engineering costs by using plug-and-play system-on-chip (SoC) designs, where the communication among different components is provided by an on-chip interconnection network. Unfortunately, building an on-chip network (OCN) that is suitable for a specific SoC design requires the exploration of a large number of design options and involves diverse research methodologies to evaluate performance, area, energy, and timing. In this paper, we propose PyOCN, a unified framework that vertically integrates multiple research methodologies to enable productively exploring the OCN design space. PyOCN is the first comprehensive framework for modeling (e.g., functional-level, cycle-level, and register-transfer-level), testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, and property-based random testing), and evaluating (e.g., simulating, generating, and characterizing) on-chip interconnection networks. We use a case study based on a 64-terminal butterfly network to illustrate the key features of PyOCN and to demonstrate the framework's potential in productively modeling, testing, and evaluating OCNs.

AB The work presented in this paper takes place in the design initiatives that have emerged to thwart BadUSB threats [59]. Though many attempts were focusing on the host side, by enhancing the operating system's USB sub-module robustness [78, 80] or by adding a proxy between the host and the device [6, 53], we have chosen to focus our efforts on the device side. More specifically, our work presents the WooKey platform, a custom highly secure USB thumb drive with mass storage capabilities, designed for user data encryption and protection, and embedding a full-fledged set of in-depth defenses. The device encloses a firmware with a secure DFU (Device Firmware Update) implementation using up-to-date cryptography as well as an external and extractable authentication token based on a secure element. The runtime software security is built upon EwoK, an innovative open source microkernel designed for microcontrollers with advanced security and performance in mind. Finally, another strength of the project is its core guiding principle: provide an open source and open hardware platform [3] using off-the-shelf components.

AB This paper presents a new multi-agent framework using open-source software (MAFOSS). The proposed framework is a modular and cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is intended to help develop multi-agent systems for research and education. Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to date that are used in various robotic applications, such as surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others. However, most of them are either tailored towards particular applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called "eduMOD" mobile robots). The software architecture of the current framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS). Regardless of internal hardware and/or software architecture, appropriate actions can be applied to actuators of an individual or a team of mobile agents for controlling their motions. A few case studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of MAFOSS.

AB The Abbe School of Photonics (ASP) provides photonics education of graduate and doctoral students at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. The main instrument for training students in optical sciences is a Master's degree program, which is open to international students, research-oriented and supported by German photonics industry. In this context, a conceptually new open lab Makerspace for photonics was established to support both the internal students in the realization of innovative and creative processes, as well as to build a strong and curious community of like-minded people from outside of the university. The photonics Makerspace provides all tools and materials needed to setup state-of-the-art optical instruments. Furthermore, it provides technical mentoring, open workshops and lectures. Partners from the photonics industry corroborate the process of making by well-established open innovation schemes and are integrated into the Makerspace with hackathon and innovation camp formats where the Makerspace users work on industry challenges. Finished and ongoing projects are transformed into freely accessible, open source hardware while a commercial exploitation of the projects is supported. Out of the broad topical spectrum of ongoing projects, two quite advanced examples are a low-cost smartphone-based 3D-scanner with a cloud-based, free software and a high-resolution microscope built of 3D-printed modules. For these projects, apart from hardware and software, also workshops and lectures are available. Other examples include a drone for medical applications in search and rescue, a smartphone-based lithography setup, a Raman-spectrometer, a camera array for meteorite detection, and many more. All activities of the Makerspace are scientifically investigated with special attention on the interaction between open innovation approaches and the Maker scene. Here, we will share our insights into potentials and opportunities offered by this novel educative approach.

AB This paper presents a new framework for the development of an ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) as a final tangible objective, but also important is the creation of a team to get it.
   In recent years, the investment on the ROVs has increased significantly. Moreover, the number of underwater investigations has advanced constantly, in the fields of submarine environments, marine geology, chemical, naval engineering, among many others. The ROV was born because of the needed for a resource in these investigations. This equipment must be capable and efficient into this environment, the underwater one.
   At present, there is a large list of ROVs, provided with more efficiency and features, but the cost is relatively expensive. The primary objective of this project is to create a low-cost ROV for investigations with a low budget. For these reasons, the design of this ROV uses Open Hardware and Open Software. Furthermore, the structure and the electronic components of the ROV are designed with cheap materials which are also easy to be found, as far as possible.
   The addition of different specific projects, set the methodology to create a big project incorporated these specific projects, compose part of the vehicle submarine. Every part is revised by the teacher of this knowledge area involved in the project.
   At present, the project continues developing and growing. For the students, the possibility of forming part of this project is a great opportunity to apply the knowledge achieved along their studies to a common project, and create a multidisciplinary working team with a common goal to attain from different areas of knowledge. It has also provided the students with the opportunity of extending the project into their final degree project, Master thesis and PhD thesis, respectively.
   Finally, collaboration among different areas of knowledge is essential. As a result, the creation of a multidisciplinary group of teachers and students, have been collaborating towards obtaining an operative ROV. The areas involved in this project are: science and navigation techniques, shipbuilding, robotics, mechanics, electronics, Computer Science, hydrodynamics, automatics, ... Therefore, the project team has been composed of teachers and students from the Computer Science, Radioelectronic Engineering and Shipbuilding Engineering fields of the University of Cadiz.

AB We present a vertical integration of a real-time Industrial Internet of Things environment with Cloud computing functionalities. We designed our testbed to implement self-adaptive wings for motorbikes using pressure values sensed in specific locations of the motorbike as input data collected exploiting open-hardware devices called OpenMotes which communicate through a low-power, delay-constrained wireless network based on the 6LoWPAN protocol stack. Our real-time on-board unit elaborates the data, and it computes the new angle of attack of two wings. The total response time of the system is in the order of 100 ms and meets the real-time requirements that constrains our scenario. Finally, we integrate our system with Cloud functionalities that we use for storing the acquired data on a time-series database.

AB The advent of Internet of Things - IoT - technology has elevated the embedded solutions employment to level never seen before, both in the problem-solving possibilities as in the complexity of the new systems. SoC-based computers such as those used in embedded systems have been under growing attention due to their low-cost, low-power, reduced footprint and high performance characteristics. These features allow small users as well as industries to design, develop and build wide range of applications with efficiency as the common aspect. A number of platforms that integrate this kind of technology were also proposed by different manufacturers, some employing the open hardware concept. Embedded applications spread over a wide range of fields, which make them hard to characterize in a general sense. For this reason, benchmark suites are often used as a tool for system's performance evaluation. However, such suites consist on a large number of different algorithms, which can spend time and energy to run on SoC computers. In order to contribute to the performance assessment of such systems, this paper presents a simple method for comparing different platforms, based on execution time of simple but representative algorithms: sorting, cross-correlation and discrete-cosine transform calculation for vectors. The power consumption was also considered. Six distinct architectures were used as a case study. Several computer experiments were conducted in order to make possible a statistic characterization of different load conditions in distinct platforms, so their comparison can be done in a meaningful way. Results show that the proposed method provides a good estimation of relative system performance, which can be useful as a criterion choice for selecting different embedded platforms.

AB Testbeds are a key tool for evaluating and benchmarking IoT solutions. Several public testbeds are being run by institutions around the world. These are built with a variety of tools, and are typically "heavy" installations with dedicated wiring, hard installations, switches, servers, and a reservation and experiment management back-end. To complement those, we have taken the opposite, minimalistic, approach in designing the OpenTestBed. The OpenTestBed features all the tools necessary to build a testbed from off-the-shelf components such as Raspberry Pi single-board computers, OpenMote B low-power wireless devices, and glass domes. Each TestBox in the testbed connects to an MQTT broker over WiFi, no dedicated wiring or back-end is needed. The Inria-Paris OpenTestBed testbed of 80 motes has cost only 9,480 euros, and is open-access. The OpenTestBed is a fully open-source and open-hardware project, which several institutions have already adopted.

AB Wrist-worn devices hold great potential as a platform for mobile health (mHealth) applications because they comprise a familiar, convenient form factor and can embed sensors in proximity to the human body. Despite this potential, however, they are severely limited in battery life, storage, bandwidth, computing power, and screen size. In this paper, we describe the experience of the research and development team designing, implementing and evaluating Amulet - an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device - and its experience using Amulet to deploy mHealth apps in the field. In the past five years the team conducted 11 studies in the lab and in the field, involving 204 participants and collecting over 77,780 hours of sensor data. We describe the technical issues the team encountered and the lessons they learned, and conclude with a set of recommendations. We anticipate the experience described herein will be useful for the development of other research-oriented computing platforms. It should also be useful for researchers interested in developing and deploying mHealth applications, whether with the Amulet system or with other wearable platforms.

AB The posit number system is proposed as a replacement of IEEE floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit system that include performance and resource consumption.
   To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++ templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of the "quire", a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of products. The proposed library includes the first open-source parameterized hardware quire.
   This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still, standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point.

AB Ultrasound diagnostic imaging is an essential aspect of modern healthcare, but barriers such as cost, technical training, and access to medical facilities impede global adoption. To tackle these factors, the need for a portable open-source three-imensional ultrasound system is discussed. Such a system, equipped with artificial intelligence, can provide unparalleled global accessibility to life-saving affordable medical diagnostic care as well as create copious amounts of data needed for training automated systems; however, it may also carry disadvantages. This paper assesses the considerations for and against an open-ource approach and draws insights from successful open-source hardware projects in the past.

AB In the present work, a modular and low-cost FPGA-based phased array system was developed that uses transducers emitting at 40 kHz for the acoustic levitation of small objects (<= 4 mm). The system consists of a driver board, transducer arrays with various layouts, and software developed in MATLAB (R). The software can be used to simulate the acoustic field, calculate acoustic traps, and control the driver board via a provided USB-SPI interface. The driver board controls up to 100 channels simultaneously with square-wave signals up to 20 Vpp with pi/1024 phase resolution and 10 bit amplitude resolution. Several phased arrays can be linked via a provided (IC)-C-2 interface to increase the number of available channels. The functionality of the system is demonstrated by the levitation of small objects using a flat 40 kHz transducer array.

ID INFORMATION-FLOW TRACKING
AB Modern computer systems are becoming faster, more efficient, and increasingly interconnected with each generation. Thus, these platforms grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that affected all major hardware vendors.
   In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we construct the first representative testbed of real-world software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work, we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future research in hardware security verification and contributing to the open-source hardware landscape.

AB To be secure, cryptographic algorithms crucially rely on the underlying hardware to avoid inadvertent leakage of secrets through timing side channels. Unfortunately, such timing channels are ubiquitous in modern hardware, due to its labyrinthine fast-paths and optimizations. A promising way to avoid timing vulnerabilities is to devise-and verify-conditions under which a hardware design is free of timing variability, i.e., executes in constant-time. In this paper, we present IODINE: a clock-precise, constant-time approach to eliminating timing side channels in hardware. IODINE succeeds in verifying various open source hardware designs in seconds and with little developer effort. IODINE also discovered two constant-time violations: one in a floating-point unit and another one in an RSA encryption module.

AB A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances.

AB Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of disciplines. Controlled-environment devices are increasing their functionalities as well as improving their accessibility. Traditionally, building one of these devices from scratch implies knowledge in fields such as mechanical engineering, digital electronics, programming, and energy management. However, the requirements of an effective controlled-environment device for personal use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper presents the OpenAgT Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size platform, which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also hobbyists, makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12). The PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that can be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis. Thanks to its modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of activities.

AB With the development of technologies such as the Internet of Things and Big Data, agriculture is entering the digital age. Modern information technology and intelligent equipment are the development direction of agriculture. In this paper, a remote-control system for greenhouse environment was developed based on Raspberry Pi, MySQL and Android. The system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database (subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including real-time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to greenhouses. All monitoring settings can be operated remotely by users. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, industrial automation systems are mostly used with proprietary hardware and software. Creating such systems requires relatively large costs. This is a problem when designing control systems with a limited budget, which are created, for example, in developing countries or small businesses. Currently, there have been opportunities to create low-cost automation systems by using solutions distributed on the basis of open-source and open-hardware. The work reviews the most important solutions and presents examples of their use in automation systems. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

DE GIS spacer; aging time; dielectric property; thermal property
AB The aging of insulation materials in GIS leads to a series of electrical problems. As a fully enclosed device, GIS faces extremely complex repairing problems once an accident occurs comparing with the separated open equipment. The root cause of this problem is multifaceted, including not only the high voltage issues, but also the environmental factors in operation such as temperature, mechanical vibration, etc. All these lead to the aging of insulation materials and the failure of the equipment. Therefore, it is important to analyze the aging state of the GIS spacer, especially the GIS spacers in service. In this paper, to evaluate the aging state of the GIS spacer in service, the structural properties, as well as electrical performance of insulating material obtained from a GIS spacer served more than 15 years are characterized and compared with that of a new GIS spacer. To investigate the change in electrical properties, dielectric loss test, polarization current, surface resistance, and partial discharge measurement are delivered. And thermal characterizations including DSC, TGA and IR are also delivered to investigate the structure change of the insulation epoxy. The results show that the aging effect reduces the surface resistances and increases the dielectric loss, polarization current and partial discharge. And with the service time increases, the glass transition temperature and the thermal decomposition temperature of the GIS spacer declines.

This paper presents our preliminary results to develop sustainable prostheses for five upper-extremity amputee patients in Colombia, South America. We utilized a patient-centric methodology, engaging patients at every stage in an effort to increase their satisfaction with their prosthetic and to assess clinical usefulness. We identified patient-specific criteria and compared existing open source hardware systems using the Design Thinking methodology. Finally, we present these data to further the development of myoelectric prosthetics as part of cyber-physical systems.

AB Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with few centimeters of diameter and sub-10 Watts of total power budget, have so far been considered incapable of running sophisticated visual-based autonomous navigation software without external aid from base-stations, ad-hoc local positioning infrastructure, and powerful external computation servers. In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 27 g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end, closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. Our visual navigation engine is enabled by the combination of an ultra-low power computing device (the GAP8 system-on-chip) with a novel methodology for the deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We enable onboard real-time execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18 Hz. Field experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5 m/s. In addition, we also demonstrate the capability of our visual navigation engine of fully autonomous indoor navigation on a 113m previously unseen path. To share our key findings with the embedded and robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous nano-UAVs, we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained networks.

AB We present a fully programmable ultra-lowpower embedded platform that hosts an "electronic skin" (E-skin) arrays of tactile sensors with up to 64 channels, ECG/EMG sensors up to 8 channels, inertial sensors, and a Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 module. The platform's compute engine is a heterogeneous multi-core parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor based on RISC-V, capable of delivering up to 2.5 GOPS, within a 55 mW power consumption envelope, which makes the platform ideal for battery-powered always-on operation. Experimental results show a peak of 38.3x energy efficiency increase (0.7 V, 85 MHz) compared to ARM-Cortex-M microcontrollers with similar power budgets.

AB Recent advances in positional tracking systems for virtual and augmented reality have opened up the possibilities for ubiquitous motion capture technology in the consumer market. However, for many applications such as in performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine, these systems remain too bulky, expensive, and limited to tracking a few objects at a time. In this work, we present a small wireless device that takes advantage of existing HTC Vive lighthouse tracking technology to provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking capabilities. This open hardware and open software project contains several elements, and the latest contributions described in this paper include: (1) a characterization of the optical distortions of the lighthouses, (2) a new cross-platform WebBLE interface, and (3) a real-time in-browser visualization. We also introduce new possibilities with an adaptive calibration to estimate transformation matrices of lighthouses, and an FPGA approach to improve precision and adaptability. Finally, we show how the new developments reduce setup costs and increase the accessibility of our tracking technology.

AB Optogenetic systems enable unmatched precision for controlling molecular biological processes but require the use of specialized electrical and optical hardware. In an effort to make working with optogenetic systems more accessible, we recently described an open-source hardware platform called the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA). The LPA is a device capable of delivering two independent light signals from standard LEDs to wells of a 24-well culture plate. Basic to advanced level light programs can be created for the LPA in Iris, an easy to use, open-source web application. In this chapter, we describe each step required to build, program, and use the LPA.

AB Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults worldwide. Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost, among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field.

AB In this paper, a measurement device based on "Open Source" components of hardware and software will be presented. This device has been used to measure voltages and currents of a low-voltage (LV) networks, on which a virtually unlimited number of sensors can be added, and the device is assembled of components available on electronic components Internet. The used hardware for this project is based on Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and peripheral sensors needed for measurement of the mentioned data. The Arduino motherboard is not only the sole peace of hardware, but it can also act as a Wi-Fi router for the devices and the laptop used for data presentation and server side computations. The server is programmed in Java programming language and is open source. Main goal was to make smart meter by the "Do It Yourself" method spending as much less founds as it is possible, by keeping user friendly interface, data validity, accuracy of measurement and ease of use for final user. Data gathering is achieved in almost 1 ms which is excellent for custom made device. However, the measured values should be calculated to RMS values to be usable for energy analyzes and further processing of information.

AB The paper describes the possibilities of data acquisition and data processing from optical sensing systems. There are some data acquisition cards and their disadvantages when used for more complex single fiber sensor systems in the paper. It is suitable to use some open source hardware because commercially available data acquisition cards are more complex and universal which means they have several different inputs/outputs and large dimensions. STEMLab 125-14 (Red Pitaya) appears to be the most suitable solution because offers 2 analog inputs and 2 analog outputs.Compare to standard data processing systems, this is supposed to be an advantage in preprocessing data using programmable logic. This can reduce the volume of transmitted data and can also speed up processing. Thus, the measurement system will be smaller and cheaper. The device contains DA converters, therefore pulses might be generated using the same clock which enables synchronization of backscatter signal.

AB Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing.

AB Advances in semiconductor miniaturization are an important driver for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since their invention in the 1980s. The increasing number of available on chip logic resources on one hand and on the other hand a decrease in part costs let the FPGA market grow steadily in recent years. It comes thus at no surprise that more and more microprocessors are integrated into programmable logic devices as they represent the central functionality in many digital systems. In parallel to these technological developments the open-source hardware community grew steadily in the last two decades. More than hundred open-source CPU cores can thus be found and selecting a core for a design project has to be done with care. In this work we thus want to focus on open-source 32-bit CPU IP cores suitable for FPGAs and which support the upcoming free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture that has some interesting advantages when compared to commercial CPU cores (as will be outlined in the paper). An overview on available projects and activities will be given and evaluation results for a selection of cores will be presented.

AB With the emerging trend of the Internet of Things and Smart City environments, new trends have arisen in building applications, too. The current approach to application development, known as monolithic architecture, is not suitable for the newest appliances. Recently, the microservice-based application architecture has emerged as a potential solution that could meet the imposed challenges. In order to educate new generations of software and IT engineers to be able to develop such microservice-based applications, educators at universities should establish an efficient platform to ensure this process. This article presents the portable and lightweight platform for teaching application development based on microservices. The platform is focused on supporting lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocols, such as MQTT, and built-on open-source hardware development boards such as Arduino/Genuino. This Smart City learning platform is designed to enable the collaborative development of systems, applications and services for the cities of the future, and it should be efficient enough to support the learning of all the necessary skills that can be used for the development of complex and large-scale systems. The architecture of the proposed platform, as well as its elements are presented in this article.

AB Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

AB Equipment shortages in Africa undermine Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education. We have pioneered the LabHackathon (LabHack): a novel initiative that adapts the conventional hackathon and draws on insights from the Open Hardware movement and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). LabHacks are fun, educational events that challenge student participants to build frugal and reproducible pieces of laboratory equipment. Completed designs are then made available to others. LabHacks can therefore facilitate the open and sustainable design of laboratory equipment, in situ, in Africa. In this case study we describe the LabHackathon model, discuss its application in a pilot event held in Zimbabwe and outline the opportunities and challenges it presents.

AB Vector similarity searching consists of comparing a query vector against a high volume of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-norm, or Hamming distance. Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and research in this area.

AB We report that a large field of view (FOV) retinal image can be acquired by a low-cost smart fundus camera. This handheld system includes a Raspberry Pi board, a touch screen display, a customized optical lens group, a ring LED light, and a Li-battery. Based on the open hardware platform and Linux operating system, we have integrated the portable system with component switching and image processing functions. Wide FOV has been realized using image stitching and structure from motion algorithms. This customized low-cost handheld fundus camera provides better image quality than cellphone-based fundus imaging solutions and offers more operational features than traditional portable fundus cameras. It may benefit field portable ophthalmic diagnostic applications.

ID SIGNAL
AB A high sensitivity Kerr magnetometer (Delta I/I = 1/30) is presented, making use of open source hardware and software. By making time resolved measurements (up to 0.15 s/cycle) the signal quality has been greatly improved up to an order of magnitude, enabling us to compare our measurements with commercial vibrating sample magnetometers. We also present an additional setup to amplify the Kerr signal in a 25:1 scale, cleaning a large part of the electronic and trigger noise.

TI Design and Building of an Automatic Alternator Synchronizer Based on

DE Electric machines; alternator; power systems
AB In power generation systems the synchronization of an alternator with the electrical network are an important and critical task. This paper presents the design and building of an automatic three-phase alternator synchronizer based on a low-cost open-hardware Arduino platform. The synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive. The design and practical implementation of the system is proposed as a project-based learning (PBL) activity for undergraduate final year students at the University of Bio-Bio, Chile. A description of the constructed prototype and the results obtained are presented and discussed.

AB The use of unmanned aquatic surface vehicles as a tool for exploring and inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a third method that allows the robot's full software system including real world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal ( applied force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water. Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform.

ID DIVISION
AB This paper proposes open-source hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator (PACoGen) for the recently developed universal number posit number system, along with a set of pipelined architectures. The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length "regime-bit" and "exponent-bit" (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation.

AB Cosmic rays represent not only a significant health risk to the crew of spacecraft and aircraft but also a fundamental phenomenon of basic research on the origin and composition of the universe. High-energy atmospheric physics is a newly opened research domain which focuses on research of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that can measurably contribute to the aircraft-crew irradiation according to the preliminary computer simulations. High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both the continual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of AIRDOS is built on the Open hardware modular platform MLAB. the firmware is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is freely available. Two AIRDOS devices have been installed at Basic Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available, including the Liulin MDU. Preliminary results of comparative measurements of radiation environment at BEO Moussala using the AIRDOS units and Liulin MDU will be presented. The results from BEO Moussala will be compared with data acquired on hoard aircraft.

AB Some people with severe disabilities are confined in a state in which communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts into words. The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature.

AB The advent of mobile and wearable computing technology has opened up tremendous opportunities for health and wellness applications. It is increasingly possible for individuals to wear devices that can sense their physiology or health-related behaviors, collecting valuable data in support of diagnosis, treatment, public health, or other applications. From a researcher's point of view, the commercial availability of these "mHealth" devices has made it feasible to conduct scientific studies of health conditions and to explore health-related interventions. It remains difficult, however, to conduct systems work or other experimental research involving the hardware, software, security, and networking aspects of mobile and wearable technology. In this paper we describe the Amulet platform, an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device designed specifically for mHealth applications. Our position is that the Amulet is an inexpensive platform for research and education, and we encourage the mHealth community to explore its potential.

AB Internet of Things devices have spread to near ubiquity this decade. All around us now lies an invisible mesh of communication from devices embedded in seemingly everything. Inevitably some of that communication flying around our heads will contain data that must be protected or otherwise shielded from tampering. The responsibility to protect this sensitive information from malicious actors as it travels through the air then falls upon the standards used to communicate this data. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these standards, the aim of this paper is to put its security standards to test. By attempting to exploit its vulnerabilities we can see how secure this standard really is. In this paper, we present steps for analyzing the security of BLE devices using open-source hardware and software.

AB Microplate (i.e. microwell plate) is a flat plate that has a specific number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies. In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines.

AB Cars for disabled drivers consist of adapting their functionalities to be operated by hands, in a manner a paraplegic individual should rely only on their hands. This task can become difficult taking into account that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino and, afterwards, sent to a Raspberry Pi. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to control automotive functionalities. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of real-time car functionalities control using electromyography and efficient low-cost hardware. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Open source paradigm is becoming widely accepted in scientific communities and open source hardware is finding its steady place in chemistry research. In this review article, we provide the reader with the most up-to-date information on open source hardware and software resources enabling the construction and utilization of an "open source capillary electrophoresis instrument". While CE is still underused as a separation technique, it offers unique flexibility, low-cost, and high efficiency and is particularly suitable for open source instrumental development. We overview the major parts of CE instruments, such as high voltage power supplies, detectors, data acquisition systems, and CE software resources with emphasis on availability of the open source information on the web and in the scientific literature. This review is the first of its kind, revealing accessible blueprints of most parts from which a fully functional open source CE system can be built. By collecting the extensive information on open source capillary electrophoresis in this review article, the authors aim at facilitating the dissemination of knowledge on CE within and outside the scientific community, fosters innovation and inspire other researchers to improve the shared CE blueprints.

AB The use of open software and hardware in STEM education is advantageous due to cost effectiveness and ready availability of design and implementation information. This project, performed as part of the NJ Governor's STEM research competition, involved reverse engineering of a blood glucose analysis meter along with augmentation of features implemented in custom software. An app was created in order to access carbohydrate intake based on dietary consumption, which would then be compared to a diabetic's daily glucose level readings. Projections of biometric trends, along with identification of foods that are helpful or to avoid, can provide important feedback to the user about their personal choices. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly limiting access to this data, so the open model is encouraged as it provides more customization and greater understanding to the user.
   This project can be implemented over the course of a school semester, with one or more teams of 4-6 high school or early college students working in an engineering laboratory setting. The cost of parts is under $50.00, plus a programmable microcontroller. Skills learned include: circuit reading, circuit design, parts ordering, breadboarding, soldering, database construction and management, programming language learning, microcontroller integration, and software and application design and programming. The set of tasks can be divided up among the students, but results should be shared during final implementation in order that all can benefit from what was accomplished.

ID PEER PRODUCTION
AB This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an "operational pragmatics." Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how "operational pragmatics" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.

AB This paper discusses how emerging issues in housing construction could revolutionise the building industry. It focuses on commons-based networks of organisations, technologies and users that form a niche practice on the margins of the dominant paradigm. This practice can be understood as "Design Global, Manufacture Local" and is exemplified by the Hexayurt, the Open Source Ecology Microhouse and the WikiHouse. Using these descriptive case studies, light is shed on the challenges and opportunities of open construction systems with regard to technological, institutional and social perspectives. Notwithstanding the positive dynamics, certain issues need to be addressed, so that a sustainable built environment could flourish.

AB Agricultural research involves study of the complex soil-plant-atmosphere-water system, and data relating to this system must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.

AB The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.

AB In general, warehouses are used to store goods or products. In the Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the products attached to the tags with product information and their respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow. The web page which is built in accordance to provide convenient and an interface to the user to track the products. The developed system results a very low cost system and works dynamically compared with the existing present warehouse inventory management systems.

AB Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.

AB This work describes the development of a peristaltic pump and a photometric detector, using "Arduino" and alternative and low-cost materials for flow analysis system. The analytical calibration curve of the acid-red-283 using the proposed system presents 0.9984 and 3.9% as the coefficients of determination and variation, and 1.1 and 3.8 mg L-1 as limits of detection and quantification, respectively. Three prepared samples of the acid-red-283 (25, 30 and 35 mg L-1) showed recovery between 99 to 104%. For construction of the peristaltic pump and the photometer using Light Emitting Diodes (LED), light-dependent resistor (LDR) were spent less than 10% of the cost was spent on a commercial system employing a peristaltic pump and a spectrophotometer. Furthermore, the peristaltic pump and the photometer developed in this work allow the implementation of practical disciplines, such as molecular absorption spectrophotometry and flow analysis system in undergraduate courses, making these instruments more accessible, especially for the chemistry students.

AB Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.

AB Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable ((sic)810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one open-source system were made freely available at https://github.com/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself.

AB Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-I t-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education. The design and development documents will be available on www.BiosignalPl.com, for open access under a Non Commercial-Share A like 4.0 International License.

AB Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.

AB Despite a growing consensus that 3D printing technology has emerged as a revolutionary driver of innovation in society and has grown exponentially as an innovation ecosystem, our understanding of how the 3D printing ecosystem emerged and has grown is still limited. Based on the case study and the grounded theory approach, we found that four relevant platforms--open-source hardware platforms, online service platforms, free and low-cost 3D design software platforms, and crowdsourcing platforms-nurtured the innovation ecosystem. We also found that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently, we newly suggest "complementary multiplatforms," a platform strategy that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. Our findings provide important theoretical grounds for the multiplatform strategy with complementary relationships aimed at facilitating the growth of an innovation ecosystem.

AB Purpose: To study the role of temperature in biological systems, diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4) stubs.
   Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch.
   Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated.
   Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases. All design files of the switch will be made available open source at www.opensourceimaging.org.

AB Laboratory automation improves test reproducibility, which is vital to patient care in clinical laboratories. Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path length compensations.

AB Critical to maintaining quality control in high-throughput screening is the need for constant monitoring of liquid-dispensing fidelity. Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Commons; Open source; Degrowth; Open hardware; Localization
ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus is on the "design global, manufacture local" model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a "design global, manufacture local" model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. "Design global, manufacture local" may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production.

AB The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.
   This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features.

AB We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments.

Our main innovation is in the design of a robust full-body biped humanoid robot equipped with very low-cost polyurethane torsional spring fixed to traditional servo motors and a circuit to measure angular displacement, transforming the system into a series elastic actuator (SEA). In order to illustrate the robot's qualities in the field of machine learning applied to robotics and manipulation, a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN) is implemented, allowing the robot to replicate combined movement sequences earlier taught via interactive demonstration.

AB Microcontrollers are programmable, integrated circuit chips. In the last two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously, the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a dreadful chip-in-a-lab-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future perspectives.

AB The design and construction of a low-cost and compact USB photometer based on open source hardware and software is described. The device, featuring a 1 ms sample acquisition time, utilizes a single interchangeable light emitting diode (LED) as a light source in combination with photodiode detectors and a Texas Instruments LaunchPad as the main control unit. An appropriately constructed flow cell can be connected to a flow reactor made out of transparent polymeric material such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing. The flow cell can be moved to different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine the residence time distribution (RTD) of various microreactors/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition time of the novel device the lengths of individual segments can be measured in real time.

AB Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital Raymundo Abarca Alarcon, constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources.

AB This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much as possible on open hardware.

AB In this paper we demonstrate a potentiostat built with a single commercially available integrated circuit (IC) that does not require any external electronic components to perform electrochemical experiments. This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC (R)) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components. To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.

AB In this paper, a general architecture for the implementation of software-defined optoelectronic systems is described. This concept harnesses the flexibility of software-defined hardware to implement optoelectronic systems which can be configured to adapt to multiple high speed optical engineering applications. As an application example, a software-defined optical interferometer using a commercial software-defined radio platform is built. The system is tested by performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic signals in a concentrated dye solution. Using software modifications only, conventional single carrier and also multicarrier heterodyne techniques with space and frequency diversity are performed. The latter technique shows a noticeable performance improvement in single-shot interferometric measurements.

AB Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy.

AB "Smart" water systems are transforming the field of stormwater management by enabling real-time monitoring and control of previously static infrastructure. While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies.

AB As a result of the globalisation of the semiconductor design and fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware.

AB This paper presents a system for remote monitoring of turbidity data that can detect light intensity and temperature using a microcontroller and the Internet of Things. The system comprises a light dependent resistor and infrared temperature sensor interfaced with an ESP-12E microcontroller, a programmable data acquisition platform; together these enable remote real-time monitoring of turbidity data applicable to chemical education. This system will allow educators and students to monitor chemical experiments in real-time through a web browser. Changes in turbidity and signal processing associated with a light dependent resistor are stored locally on the microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via a WiFi-based connection to a cloud-based server. The light intensity signals are displayed on the system through an organic light-emitting diode and subsequently uploaded to a cloud-based server. A web-based signal processing MATLAB program plots the uploaded signals available as real-time streams to authorized subscribers over standard browsers.

AB Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.

AB This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab's approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen/civic veillance, or "sousveillance", by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide.

TI Estimation of the uncertainty in an experimental prototype based on open

   movement of a particle
SO 3C TECNOLOGIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Kinematics; Dynamics; Uncertainty; Open hardware; Measurement
AB The kinematic studies the motion of a particle without considering the effects that produce movement, while the dynamics studies the factors that produce changes in a system. It proposes the establishment of measuring equipment that can record physical parameters focused on the kinematics and dynamics, using the equations deducted from the calculation for the movement, by modifying travel distance, angle of inclination and mass of the objects. The measurement of the time will be used to obtain the uncertainty in the experiments, the dispersion of the available data is related to the size of the sample and the procedure used. In the indirect measurements were used equations due to the correlation in the physical variables for the analysis of uncertainty. One of the methods for uncertainty analysis is based on the statistical analysis, another way to estimate this is through experience or external information available. The experiments made in the inclined plane for the study of the velocity, acceleration and force of friction to angles greater than 15 degrees, showed a relative error of 1.8% in the time variable, the standard uncertainty had a normal distribution with a confidence level of 95%.

DE Differential-drive robot; interface; robotics; ROS; swarm; Turtlebot 2;

AB To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manuf acturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.
   This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them.
   Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future.

AB Supported by easier and cheaper access to tools and expanding communities, maker cultures are pointing towards the ideas of (almost) everyone designing, creating, producing and distributing renewed, new and improved products, machines, things or artefacts. A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed.

ID GRAPHENE OXIDE; MICROSTRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION; RECONSTRUCTION;
   METHODOLOGY; DESIGN
AB The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term 'superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of > 99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.

AB Fog computing is gaining attention due to the potential of aggregating and processing time-sensitive data at the nearby intelligent gateways. It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM/GPRS technology and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog Gateways scheme in real-time application.

AB 1. The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers.
   2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: "AudioMoth." The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems.
   3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording.
   4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.

AB Scientific communities are drawn to the open source model as an increasingly utilitarian method to produce and share work. Initially used as a means to develop freely-available software, open source projects have been applied to hardware including scientific tools. Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards.

AB Applications involving data acquisition from sensors need samples at a preset frequency rate, the filtering out of noise and/or analysis of certain frequency components. We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and intuitive.

AB Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W/m(2). An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices.

AB Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are increasingly being deployed for surveillance and monitoring applications. WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments.

AB Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in many areas, such as intelligent transportation, smart city, hospital, games, education. Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the students' answer to teachers' managerment system, where there exists high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students' identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms, such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students' behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen the motivation of students' learning. This IoT system can improve the attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students' learning process for higher education.

AB Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator.

AB This paper deals with the design and development of a low cost building environmental monitoring system, and it is based on Open Source Platforms and on the Internet of Things. To achieve this aim, a wireless micro-controller with attached sensors has been used to collect the environmental data. The information obtained from the sensors is collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet, which permits us to access the information in real time.
   On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy performance and providing information related to the data storage and its cost of development.
   The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple applications of Smart Environments. The development of projects through these platforms will allow future research to tackle the existing barriers in monitoring campaigns.

AB Rapid manufacturing using 3-D printing is a potential solution to some of the most pressing issues for humanitarian logistics. In this paper, findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6) on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control mechanisms. The technology is then disclosed with an open source license for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer. A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a humanitarian context.

DE FPGA-as-a-service; hardware acceleration; open-source hardware
AB Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware co-design leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.

The developed algorithm makes a search for sections that belong to adjacent feeders and comply with two conditions: have normally open equipment installed or have a three or more derivations. As soon as the sections are selected, an exhaustive search is executed to achieve the restoration plan. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, service restoration on a typical distribution system of Taiwan Power Company is applied. The results are compared with others approaches and show that the proposed method can provide a restoration plan very efficiently even under different load levels.

AB In this study, the effect of web based power electronics courses on the success of electrical engineering candidates was examined. The participants are consisted of daytime education (30) and evening education (42) students who attended the "Power Electronics" course. First, groups were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups and experimental group and control group were examined according to the students' GPAs, university entrance exam results, academic grades depending on 8 different lectures related with power electronics.
   According to the results obtained from validity and reliability of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test, the total correlation values and the standard deviation values of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test were between.301-,.598 and between.304-,.506, respectively. In addition, KR20 coefficient was found as 0.844. Before application of the "Power Electronics Course Achievement Test", there was not a significant difference in total scores of both daytime and evening education students. Although students received Web-Based Education and Web Aided Education were selected as experimental group, the students received "Traditional Education" were selected as control group. After the application, significant differences between the total grade points of both experimental and control groups of daytime education and evening education students were detected.

AB The current ongoing work of the CubeSat Development Initiative is to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. The main objective of the development is to give access to space for little payloads, which can be planned and executed by researchers, designers and even understudies majoring in science, technology, engineering, and math and different orders to play out a huge number of planned missions. To design and develop any system, requirement engineering plays a vital role as it describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. The work presented in this paper is focused on developing a requirement engineering tool that can be used to increase the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities based on the use of quality attribute scenarios. The model-based requirement engineering tool described in the paper allows to link non-functional requirements and functional requirements. It utilizes quality attribute scenarios (templates) which are proposed by Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

AB Air quality has become a serious concern from the world's leading universities. The campus as a learning area needs good air quality and needs to monitor and maintain it so that academics can engage in healthy and optimal activities. This study develops a system for monitoring outdoor air quality on campus by using a wireless sensor network (WSN). MQTT Protocol is used to maximize data transmission from sensor nodes to brokers via wireless local area network (WLAN). Air quality measurement data is reported in real time via a web server that can be accessed via the internet. Sensor nodes and brokers are built using open source hardware and software. The system is implemented for measuring air quality on campus and shows measurements that are accurate, real time, and can be accessed via the web.

AB The rise of emerging technologies and the emergence of open and free hardware and software trends have allowed the emergence of new embedded system options such as the Nodemcu card based on the esp8266 microcontroller, among many others, which at very low cost allows implement an On/Off control or domotic control for an environment or location that improves its comfort and energy saving conditions as main objectives. Understanding home automation as the system capable of automating a home or building of any kind, which is capable of providing energy management, security, welfare, maintenance and communication services, and which can be integrated by means of wireless networks or Wi-Fi technology, to give a control that provides certain ubiquity, from inside and outside the place through the use of an application or app, provides a huge opportunity to take advantage of current technology adapted to any type of environment or space. This use could be defined as the integration of technology in the intelligent design of a closed area, including conventional training environments or classrooms, which unlike the rest of other locations or modern properties, do not enjoy the same advances with which they enjoy new establishments of offices, banks and hotels that make our daily activities more pleasant. This research will use the quasiexperimental method since with the collaboration of experts through the network and the state of the art consulted, small experiments or tests have been developed using low-cost technology modules, thus checking the functioning of different connections and configurations, which generates the sending and receiving of data, which allows us to give or not advance to the analysis, programming and revision of the behavior of the occupation of an environment, making the focus towards a short-term future of the research quantitative.

AB In developing countries like India, the school and college education systems are mired in the passive, teacher-centric pedagogy based on rote learning. Active, student-centric STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) learning can be achieved through extremely affordable open source hardware and free open source software to foster innovation and creativity among teachers and students in colleges and universities as well as schools. In particular, build your own and do-it-yourself (BYO/DIY) robots and tabletop subtractive and additive manufacturing machines can be designed, fabricated and disseminated for hands-on education in design, electronics, programming, robotics and manufacturing. This paper discusses an ongoing collaborative project between a higher educational institution, a non-profit foundation and a corporate sponsor to establish and operate project-based STEAM learning labs in resource-poor government high schools in nine Indian cities. The work reported is the schools outreach part of a Teaching Learning Centre for design, development and dissemination of low-cost manufacturing education technologies for engineering colleges and universities. The methodology can be replicated with locale-specific adaptations in schools elsewhere.

AB This research explores the real-time process control of polymer flowability in Powder Bed Fusion (PBF). To do so, a novel system based on machine vision and an image-processing algorithm was developed and tested in an open hardware and software PBF system. The system has the ability to analyze the quality of the powder bed by computing a defect ratio of the powder bed after each recoating operation. Then, this ratio is used as a performance variable in three full factorial Design of Experiments (DOE). The results show that the installation of machine vision and image processing system can potentially provide a signal to repeat the recoating process and correct the defect on the powder bed. At the same time, recoating process parameters can be adjusted dynamically to guarantee an optimum quality of the powder bed and minimize possible build failures.

AB We describe the development of a robust, self sustainable, versatile environmental monitoring station, the S3ME2, with a multitude of sensors capable of operating in extreme environments (from cold arid sub -arctic retOorts to hot deserts and high -altitude mountain terrains), providing realtime quality data of ctitical climate and geophysical parameters for a wide field of research such as pressure, surface and subsurface temperature and llimidity, magnetic field and seismic activity-. The dedicated communication modem utilizes loT technolo*, and can deliver this data from remote regions. The S3ME2 has been designed as a low-cost instrument to facilitate the production of multiple units. During the pilot phase, it has demonstrated continuous operability for up to 6 months, including survival (luting extremely cold, snowy, and low insolation, and low wind periods in the Sub -Arctic region. With its robust desim, S3ME2 exploits the use of renewable sources of enert,,,y such as solar and wind power to power the system. The S3ME2 has also been desigited from a modular point of view with commercial off the shelf components (COTS) and open source hardware, considering long term operability of tbe station. The sensor modules cart be easily addetl, replaced, or upgraded such that a stable functioning of the system is g,uaranteed.

ID LESSONS
AB It has been identified from literature that affordability is the main constraint faced by the majority of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network) researchers which sees them forgoing implementing real world experimental studies that are costlier, in favour of opting for cheaper simulation tools instead. While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool.

AB Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications.

AB We present an open-source accessory for the NAO robot, which enables to test computationally demanding algorithms in an external platform while preserving robot's autonomy and mobility. The platform has the form of a backpack, which can be 3D printed and replicated, and holds an ODROID XU4 board to process algorithms externally with ROS compatibility. We provide also a software bridge between the B-Human's framework and ROS to have access to the robot's sensors close to real-time. We tested the platform in several robotics applications such as data logging, visual SLAM, and robot vision with deep learning techniques. The CAD model, hardware specifications and software are available online for the benefit of the community.

AB The recent emergence of open hardware platforms has drastically reduced the cost required to develop special purpose device architectures. The RISC-V instruction set and associated ecosystem is one such architecture that has become widely popular as the basis for the next generation embedded control systems and IoT devices.
   Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is currently very little support for performing architectural experiments of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the RISC-V instruction set.
   The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms and applications.

AB Open Source Hardware (OSH) products are those whose design are made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell them. In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing clarity in this emerging and moving field. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular, we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more experiential using the hardware prototyping paradigm.

AB This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n=22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.

We focus our work on designing a low cost dataglove using open source hardware and software. We run algorithms on the micro controller to interpret basic gestures and phrases. The interpretat ' results are sent wirelessly to a bluetooth enabled smartphone to be displayed on screen. We benchmark the interpretation accuracy on three different users. Our results show that most basic sign gestures can be interpreted rather accurately using only simple algorithms.

AB Computational methods for the enhancement of energy efficiency rely on a measurement process with sufficient accuracy and number of measurements. Networked energy meters, energy monitors, serve as vital link between energy consumption of households and key insights that reveal strategies to achieve significant energy savings. During the design of such an energy monitor, several aspects such as data update rate or variety of measured physical quantities have to be considered. This paper introduces YoMoPie, a user-oriented energy monitor based on the Raspberry Pi platform that aims to enable intelligent energy services in households. YoMoPie measures active as well as apparent power, stores data locally, and integrates an easy to use Python library. Furthermore, the presented energy monitor comes with a Python API enabling the execution of user-designed services to enhance energy efficiency in buildings and households. Along with the presented design, possible applications that could run on top of this system such as residential demand response, immediate user feedback, smart meter data analytics, or energy disaggregation are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented, which compares the measurement accuracy of YoMoPie to a certified energy analyser for a selection of common household appliances.

AB MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) researchers have shown increased interest in using mobile robot technology for their testbed platforms. Thus, the main motivation of this paper is to review various robot-based MANET testbeds that have been developed in previously reported research. Additionally, suggestions to heighten mobility mechanisms by using mobile robots to be more practical, easy and inexpensive are also included in this paper, as we unveils ToMRobot, a low-cost MANET robot created from an ordinary remote control car that is capable of performing a real system MANET testbed with the addition of only a few low-cost electronic components. Despite greatly reduced costs, the ToMRobot does not sacrifice any of the necessary MANET basic structures and will still be easily customisable and upgradeable through the use of open hardware technology like Cubieboard2 and Arduino, as its robot controller. This paper will also include guidelines to enable technically limited MANET researchers to design and develop the ToMRobot. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two pronged objectives namely (i) to facilitate other MANET researchers by providing them with a source of reference that eases their decision making for selecting the best and most suitable MANET mobile robots for real mobility in their MANET testbeds (ii) to provide MANET researchers with a prospect of building their own MANET robots that can be applied in their own MANET testbed in the future.

AB Robotic automation is considered as the fourth industrial revolution by multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20%. However, for small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller, cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while moving around the RFID tagged floor.

ID TEST PROGRAM GENERATION; VALIDATION
AB The complexity and heterogeneity of digital devices used in embedded systems is increasing everyday and delivering a bug-free design is still a very complex task. The interest for open-source hardware in real products is demanding for tools and advanced methodologies for verification to provide high reliability to open and free IPs. In this work, an open-source evolutionary optimizer has been used to create functional test programs that improve the verification test set for an open-source microprocessor, enhancing in this way, the verification level of the device. The verification programs are generated to optimize code coverage metrics and are tested against a high-level model to find device incorrectnesses during the generation time. A perturbation mechanism has been included in the verification framework to cover parts of the device under verification not reachable with only software stimuli such as interrupts or memory stalls. The proposed methodology uncovered 10 bugs still present in the RTL description of the analyzed device and demonstrated the effectiveness of open-source verification tools for the next generation of open-source RISC-V microprocessors.

AB Easy-to-use and affordable means of production (e.g. 3D printer), access to these technologies (e.g. in makerspaces) and powerful tools for online product design led to the emergence of open source hardware (OSH). Like in open source software, projects and online platforms have been evolving around physical products from various technologies where people jointly develop and freely share designs. We also find businesses that sell products made from these designs and offer complimentary services. This decentralized and collaborative model of value creation offers new opportunities for social, economic and ecological sustainability, but also calls for a different understanding beyond traditional notions. Results from an exploratory study on OSH projects and companies revealed that licensing is a critical issue, communities and partners play a key role in the open source ecosystem and modes of value creation are either centered around design or production in combination with a mix of complimentary services.

AB Long-range (LoRa) radio technologies have recently gained momentum in the IoT landscape, allowing low-power communications over distances up to several kilometers. As a result, more and more LoRa networks are being deployed. However, commercially available LoRa devices are expensive and propriety, creating a barrier to entry and possibly slowing down developments and deployments of novel applications. Using open-source hardware and software platforms would allow more developers to test and build intelligent devices resulting in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry, and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. Toward this goal, this paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of KRATOS, a low-cost LoRa platform running ContikiOS. Both, our hardware and software designs are released as an open source to the research community.

AB Traditional manufacturing systems consist of devices with limited functionality and are constructed in a vertical structure. This is not suitable for smart factory environment where Internet of Things (IoT) is actively utilized and connected to external environment. Cyber Physical System (CPS), a key element of the Smart Factory, means that cyber and physical systems are tightly connected and intelligent. To build a CPS, IoT needs to be handled effectively, and stability and connectivity must be ensured. Therefore, the system in the Smart Factory is preferably built according to the loT standard. hi this paper, we propose an industrial device monitoring and control system based on oneM2M, and discuss that this system can be applied in a smart factory environment. The proposed system is based on Mobius, developed by Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI) as an open source IoT platform, and its components are open source hardware which is high performance with low cost. The Smart Factory system can be constructed in various forms using Mobius. In this paper, a model for its structure and utilization is presented.

AB A robotic platform is essential to validate any algorithm developed for mobile robotics research, as usually simulation results does not reflect all the real world circumstances and error sources. Nowadays there are several available commercial solutions that can be used to validate the developed algorithms, but they are usually expensive and closed to hardware modifications. Another option is to build the robotic platform, but while these solutions are normally open hardware and can be easily modified and maintained, many are assembled using low cost components and are intended only for robot education, and for this reason are not suitable for advanced algorithm implementation nor can employ advanced sensors. A possible solution is presented in this paper, in which an open hardware modular omnidirectional platform is developed, with robust hardware implementation using modular commercially available components, at a lower cost that some more expensive available solutions, but with similar performance and capabilities being suitable for mobile robot research and experimentation.

AB This paper introduces some trust issues for blockchain transactions. Such transactions rely on ECDSA signature based on 32 bytes secret keys. Because these keys can be stolen or hacked, we suggest to prevent these risks by using javacard secure elements. We detailed the interface of a Crypto Currency Smart Card (CCSC) designed over a JC3.04 standard platform. We details two use cases. First deals with deployment of the CCSC application in low cost low power object powered by an open hardware (arduino) platform, and integrates sensor data in ethereum transactions. Second proposes the deployment in the cloud of CCSC javacards plugged to RACS servers, in order to enable the remote and safe use of ECDSA signature.

Built with accessible and low cost components, open hardware architecture and open software, it makes possible the tests and implementation of new control algorithms by the user, setting it apart from the most common alternatives available on the market. For this device, we developed a sensoring system for capturing and recording the quadrotor odometry, an architecture to send the angular velocity commands to the motors via PWM, and the processing is made on a Raspberry Pi 3.

AB Soft wearable robots comprised of deformable materials have recently attracted much attention in the field of applications for its lightness and elasticity. However, there exist some limitation to the control of wearable robots due to the complexity of the model and the conditions of the wearer. In this paper, we propose a learning-based position control method of soft wearable glove using a deep neural network (DNN). To analyze our proposed method, we fabricated a soft pneumatic glove and a control board for the glove based on open hardware platform data. With our developed system, we collected the pressure and position data of the soft glove using a Leap Motion sensor to train our soft glove position network (SGPN). Along with our proposed DNN model, we could enable open-loop control on the joint positions of the soft glove by supplying pressure to the actuator without prior knowledge of the wearer or the wearable robot such as hand size of the wearer or the stiffness of pneumatic actuator.

AB This article illustrates how to evaluate platform design for an open source hardware development project. First, we will look at the open source hardware development as a methodology that fulfills demands for mass customization. In the open source hardware development, project owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources. Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs. Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers' participation is one of the key factors in successful project management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation.

AB Physiological (or biosignal) data acquisition and analysis has evolved from being intrinsically bound to medical practice or lab settings, to become a pervasive data source with numerous applications. This has been mostly leveraged by the proliferation of wearables and open hardware platforms. While the first devices offer good cloud connectivity (albeit to proprietary servers) but only provide high-level features, the latter have opposite characteristics, creating a gap in what concerns collaborative access to datasets for reuse in academic research. In this paper we describe a module devised to help bridge this gap, by enabling real-time biosignal streaming directly from an open hardware physiological data acquisition platform to a cloud-based repository over Wi-Fi. Performance tests have been made to assess the data transmission reliability, and the adopted approach to the repository enables user-friendly collaborative access, visualisation and sharing of the recorded data.

AB An experimental setup capable of stimulating, inhibiting, sensing, processing and analyzing a biological system is presented. The experimental setup is based on open-source, open hardware commercial devices. It can be applied to record and control neuronal activity, for example to establish causal links between neurons and behaviorin a closed-loop fashion. Cells or group of cells can be triggered by acoustical, electrical or light impulses. This last case is based on a technique defined as optogenetics. The latter is used in an example that reads and controls neuronal activity of a population of neurons in laboratory rats forcing them to transition between neuronal states, illustrates the system developed in this work.

We propose an artificial vision system - the Grid Alignment Assistant System (GAAS) - aimed at maximizing the energy flow between the transmitting and receiving goals, by supporting the driver in the task of keeping an alignment between the vehicle and the charging grids in the road. GAAS exploits low cost and open hardware and software components. GAAS supports IoT capabilities as an API cloud service is developed for real-time measurements storage. This paper presents road test results showing that high precision misalignment estimations can be achieved, and presents some challenges imposed by the actual deployment environment.

AB The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of makers that actively share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and re-distributed. Numerous authors have proposed distinct ways to seize this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: enabling scholars to explore scientific concepts, promoting students' creativity, helping them to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, and so on. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the literature on open-source hardware in education by analyzing and classifying 676 publications. The results of our work provide: 1) guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant papers, publication sources, institutions, and countries); 2) information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing its main educational goals, stages, and topics where it is principally applied); and 3) directions for future research.

ID COMPETITION; TOOL
AB The use of Robotics as a teaching tool to foster knowledge in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - STEM for high school students is growing. Within this context, the need for solutions that decreases the overall cost of hardware is mandatory. In this work, a 25 euros Android-based mobile robot that allows connecting a smartphone to different robot "bodies" (each composed by different hardware: Arduino, LEGO, etc.) is proposed, targeting mainly high school students. The mobile platform was built using 3D printed parts and uses an Arduino board to control the servos used for the locomotion. To communicate with the Android application, a Bluetooth module is also used. The Android application takes advantage of the smartphone camera and has some pre-implemented image processing modules, allowing actions such as coloured line following, colour proximity detection and coloured object tracking. Another import feature present in the Android application is its coding capability, thanks to an embedded code interpreter. This feature was implemented using BeanShell, a lightweight script interpreter for Java. It allows writing scripts in Java programming language, which are then executed by the robot. This interpreter also provides a way for the user to write a set of instructions that defines the behaviour of the robot, primarily by checking the current status of the sensors and the smartphone camera, and manipulating the velocity of the motors.
   All of the necessary components (3D source CAD + STLs) of the mobile platform presented here are available online, enabling the recreation of a replica of the robot body. A detailed list of electronic components and its connections are also provided, as well as the Arduino source code along with the installation file needed for the Android application. All the necessary information can be accessed at: https://github.com/ee09115/squirlrob.
   The high school students are then challenged to solve classical robotics tasks like line following, obstacle avoidance, and using the virtual sensors to create new challenges.
   By providing this set of tools (Android app, source code, 3D CAD models, documentation), a promotion of knowledge is expected, thus developing enthusiast students in robotics multidisciplinary fields, such as mechanical designing, electronics designing, mathematics, coding, etc. (in short, all the relevant STEM areas).
   Finally, a general analysis of the usability, interoperability and feature extension capacity is made, always taking into consideration the educational purposes of this work.

AB Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, educational robotics tools emerge with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This demonstrator focuses on driving the same content through three low-cost robotic educational tools. The first is Scratch, where you can schedule interactive stories, games and animations. The second tool is Crumble, an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that facilitates its use. Finally, Arduino is an open source, hardware- and software-based platform that is easy to use and has great potential for developing robotic applications. This demonstrator aims to present the above platforms as educational robotics tools as the first step into the world of robotics. Throughout this demonstrator an introduction to educational robotics is developed.

AB This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8 W PV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10 W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W.

AB Modern ultrasonic phased-array controllers are electronic systems capable of delaying the transmitted or received signals of multiple transducers. Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However, emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and pi/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback.

AB One of the most critical parameters in agricultural production is environmental conditions. It is of vital importance to ensure and monitor suitable climatic conditions for various controlled agricultural structures and production systems such as greenhouses. To this aim, most data monitoring systems cannot be efficiently used due to high cost and insufficient technical knowledge. It is possible to design low-cost and scalable monitoring, control and data acquisition systems via open source hardware in order to monitor climatic data for agricultural practices in small enterprises and rural areas. In this study, a low cost system designed via open source hardware was tested under real conditions. Temperature and relative humidity were measured via the sensors in the system and sent to a data server through a wireless network. In addition, collected data was compared to reference devices for statistical analysis. The results suggest that these low-cost systems, which are designed via open source hardware, can be used as a data collection and decision support, system by agricultural enterprises.

AB The need for fabricating a prototype circuit arises frequently in electronics, including education and research laboratories. In resource-poor countries in the developing world, this is hindered by the high cost of commercial Printed Circuit Board (PCB) prototyping machines and long turn-around commercial fabrication process. Practical, hands-on laboratory teaching and experimentation is necessary to improve learning in electronics. In this paper, a low-cost build-your-own (BYO) semi-automated three-axis PCB milling machine for double-sided PCB prototyping is developed using commercial components and open source hardware and free open source software, to provide students, teachers, and engineers an accessible and affordable resource for PCB prototyping. Also, the main problems encountered during fabrication of PCB have been mentioned and the techniques used to solve them are discussed in detail. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water removal is an essential step during crude oil production due to several problems such as increased transportation costs and high corrosion rate due to dissolved salts. Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm(-2)), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm(-2)). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsificadon in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach.

AB Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17-0.63% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65-9.38% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.

DE Monitoring; wireless sensor network; sensors; orchid greenhouse
AB Some countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have increased their presence in the production and export of orchids. Ecuador has 14% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports increased 8%, this shows the importance of this product for the country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design, prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in the field. Approximately 3000 samples were obtained with a 100% reliability rate in the transit of the data within the process of acquisition, transmission, reception and storage.

AB The pumping system of the Administration Board of Drinking Water and Sanitation of the Algarrobera (JAAPS-LA) is made up of a cylindrical aquifer with dimensions of 70 meters deep and 0.305 meters in diameter, the central element of this system is the submersible pump electrical, which is controlled by time. This current system has some deficiencies, among them the shortage of drinking water when the demand of the users is higher than the nominal one; and the large waste of potable water when the demand is lower than the nominal one. The present work proposes the design, implementation and integration of a monitoring and automation system applied to the JAAPS-LA pumping system, based on a wireless sensor network, open hardware and a PLC. As a result, all the modules of the system were implemented: the liquid level acquisition module in the distribution tank by means of liquid level sensors; the wireless data transmission and reception module; the drive module of the pump by means of the Programmable logic controller (PLC); and, finally, the solar-photovoltaic energy capture module. To evaluate the performance of the monitoring and automation system implemented, the behavior was monitored for 4 days, with the data obtained it was possible to verify the correct pump drive logic and the high efficiency (100%) of the communication system.

AB It is suggested to improve the level of security by applying the open source paradigm to the entire IT supply chain and by subjecting the resulting components to verification when required. This would lead to a new trajectory for IT product development which could even increase the efficiency of addressing novel types of hardware-oriented attacks or employing stealthy hardware features. This could require increased transparency of semiconductor fabs. For designing open hardware several nuclei already exist. The proposed path would hold particular promise for security-critical components, which could be specified in such a way as to precisely match hardware characteristics. As some components would continue to be built using existing components for some time, a generalized a priori statement about the security of the complete supply chain, such as "verified" or "proven", will initially be impossible.

AB Timely detection of cardiac arrhythmia is critical for diagnosis and treatment of heart related disorders. ECG signal provide valuble insight into heart functioning and enable diagnosis of arrhythmia conditions. An open hardware based system for the automated classification of heart conditions was developed. The Raspberry Pi 3b (RPi3b) single board computer was used to analyse the ECG signal and identify normal or abnormal heart conditions. The developed system can independently acquire ECG signals and classify arrythmia using ANN algorithm running on the RPi3b. The system was tested using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Realtime ECG signal acquisition and classification was also carried out.

DE Open hardware; non-programmers; Portugal; special needs; ICT
AB The inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in classrooms is a reality for many teachers. These professionals have a favourable attitude towards the inclusion of pupils with SEN in the regular teaching classrooms.
   An inclusive education system should be "structured and developed taking into account the diversity of characteristics of young children, different needs or problems" and for these reasons to differentiate measures.
   Special education is aimed at educational and social inclusion, educational access and success, autonomy, emotional stability, as well as the promotion of equal opportunities, preparation for continuing education or adequate preparation for the professional life and for a transition from school to employment of children and young people with permanent special educational needs".
   A particular case of SEN is that of people with autism, and they characterize autism as "a rare and serious psychiatric illness in childhood and characterized by imbalanced intellectual development that affects the ability to socialize." It is also reported in the literature that these people, with autism, have great difficulties in communicating verbal and nonverbal, while having a great difficulty in interpreting language.
   Technology-based learning, in particular through the use of visual and multimedia environments, is a facilitating tool for people with autism spectrum disorders to learn best when information is presented visually. This view is also shared by several authors when refer that to facilitate "inclusion and children / young people with SEN in today's society, Information and Communication Technologies play a fundamental role, as they facilitate a differentiated, active and collaborative intervention of all stakeholders in the life of each of these people".
   This document reports on an activity project that can be used by Educators of students with autism. Two tools are used, Makey-Makey hardware and Scratch software. The use of open-hardware microcontrollers, with no need for programming and free software, allows this project to be shared and reconverted to other topics. This work arose from a challenge of proposing an activity to be used by children with special educational needs using ICT. In a first step the bibliography related to the use of ICT in the classroom with these children and the legislation that served to obtain the first orientations was consulted. Then a specialist was consulted and then the prototype of the project was built, succinct enough that it could be replicated and perceived by these Educators.

AB Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task This article presents the design and implementation of a video surveillance system for linear wireless multimedia sensor networks. We adopt a procedure in which every node has unique IP address and can establish a route from itself to sink through multi-hop communication. We present a dynamic queue scheduler which filters the packets according to packet priority. The core component of this system is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. Our network is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present results of 7-node real-world deployment in video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments.

AB Different process automation requirements among university students and researchers prompted the design and development of a data acquisition and control board for use in automation activities and for taking readings in educational laboratories and industrial environments, using open-source software and hardware. This study includes a detailed description of the solution that was developed to respond to these needs: it begins by presenting the different components that make up the system, which was designed around the Arduino Due platform. It then provides a detailed functional description of these before discussing preliminary trials that were carried out using the test board These trials proved that the main components function correctly and point to the need to continue work on the prototype board to obtain more conclusive evidence that the expected results have been achieved and to check all component interactions on the final version.

AB The Army continues the development of 3D printing technology to enhance the capability to produce smaller and lighter precision weaponry. Researchers and support organizations that are affiliated with the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) are developing nano based structures and components for advanced weaponry, aviation, and autonomous air/ground systems applications. The first key area consists of determining in-plane and out-of-plane shear properties of test articles made by 3D printing (Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) and comparing to the conventional extrusion/forming sheet process. Test specimens are made from three polymer materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact poly-styrene (HIPS), and poly-lactic acid (PLA). Laboratory testing is performed according to the ASTM D3846-02 method for determining the in-plane shear strength, while the ASTM D5379 method is used for determining the out-of-plane shear properties. A description on how the 3D printing process advances the shear properties and has the potential of improving the in-plane and cross-sectional shear properties over the conventional manufacturing process is presented. The second key area demonstrates a set of materials, processes, and techniques that support the enabling of additive manufacture (AM) of RF components. Research activities are focused on developing open-source hardware/software multi-material direct digital printing, and producing 3D printed antenna, passive components, and connectors for C-band and Ku-band systems. Material studies have demonstrated a suitable material set for RF components and identified key material performance limits. Results show how more enhancement could be achieved by optimizing the variables that affect 3D printing.

AB Because of the great popularity of the maker movement, the concept of "Do it yourself" (DIY) has gained considerable public attention. Furthermore, because of the development of rapid prototyping, the rise of open-source hardware and programming languages, the popularization of network communities, and the establishment of maker spaces, DIY has been taken to the next level: "co-creation." This concept requires reform to the standard curriculum in information and technology education. Therefore, this study aims to define the key competences of makers to construct the competence indicators of Maker Education for information and technology education in elementary school. On this basis, a curriculum can be developed, and an evaluation system for learning effectiveness can be built to equip students with the abilities to adapt to life and tackle challenges. In this study, the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) was applied to collect and analyze data in the form of a questionnaire survey. The subjects were 12 experts from enterprises, governmental institutions, schools and research institutes. The research achievements include 3 factors ("Theoretical knowledge," "Practical application," "Maker's mindset"), and 10 indicators.

AB The usage of real-time tracking systems for vehicles has demonstrated to be a viable and economical option, entailing in more control and management of the fleet, plus the reduction of the logistics costs of companies using them. Since 2006 in Cuba, there is a fleet control and management system employed by almost all the companies, which hire a variant of the service in a differed manner; i.e., the data are not processed in real-time. In this research paper, we propose the design of a device based only on open source hardware/software components allowing the real-time vehicle tracking. Our proposal is suitable for the conditions of the country where it was developed (Cuba), presenting high functionality than other proposals. For the design, we employed an Arduino UNO controller board, an Adafruit FONA808 GPS/GSM module, and other accessories. As per the performed experiments, the proposed hardware/software architecture complies with the operation, configuration, and security requirements to achieve a viable product from the economical and environmental approaches.

AB Maker Education is a practice-oriented movement that has risen in the last decade, and emphasizes more on innovation, creativity and problem solving. Maker Education is based on knowledge, directed by creation, and is aimed at solving problems. This study, aimed at the curriculum of the Department of Information Management, expects to develop a systematic information Maker curriculum. This curriculum, combined with the 3D printing machine and Arduino open hardware configured with the STEM education framework, is designed to explore the impact of the introduction of Maker education to information curriculum of technical or vocational colleges on attitude differences and learning of STEM. Two courses, 3D model design and Arduino programming, are implemented, after the end of which, students' achievements are evaluated. The result is that male still have higher interests in science, engineering and technology than women, but Maker curriculum is multifaceted and foundational so that many people can spend a little time in learning and use various skills to produce their own works. Therefore, there is little difference between women and men in scores of achievement test.

DE Ball and plate system; Stewart platform; sliding mode control (SMC)
AB In this paper, we propose a cost-effective implementation method of a ball and plate system as an educational kit and present the application of sliding mode control to achieve better control performance. We choose a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance, and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system can be efficiently used as an educational tool.

AB This paper describes the initial development of a low-cost Lagrangian drifter based on solar panels, ultracapacitor and open hardware-software platform. The drifter is powered by a solar panel and a single Ultracapacitor that stores the energy. The drifter has a sensor suite formed by a GPS, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity sensors and a camera. The energy management and signal processing from sensors is supported by an Arduino Mega development board. The communications between the ground station and a deployed drifter is based on Iridium Satellite Terminal. All mechanical and electronic components are self-contained in a pressure housing. The main purpose of this Lagrangian drifter is: detect a red tide near Ecuadorian coasts, obtain physical-chemical parameters in-situ then send the measurements trough a satellite network to a ground station. Results from sea trials are shown.

AB In 2013 the Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) was started. It aims at determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows, e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals on real hardware.

AB There has been growing popularity in do-ityourself (DIY) electronics for wearable computing and human-machine interaction. This has introduced exciting opportunities to promote science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) education that highlights the intersection of electronics, materials, and artistic expression. Here, we present a systematic guide to a low-cost (<$10 per student) outreach workshop on wearable electronics for middle school students (and potentially high school students with minor modifications) that is complementary to existing STEM outreach programs. In this workshop, students use basic craft skills to fabricate a wearable human-computer interface out of commercially available materials. The device is interfaced with a computer via open source hardware and software, using the universal serial bus (USB) human interface device (HID) protocol. The workshop exposes students to wearable technologies, a rapidly growing and exciting sub-domain of the electronics industry, and provides a fun and engaging hands-on activity that draws connections between fashion, technology, and personal electronics.

AB Highly developed drone technology enables the use of drones in a wide variety of areas. However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big research topic and find a market in the near future. We developed an underwater drone with a 360 degrees panoramic camera acting as the "eye" of the drone. The designs are based on the open-source hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360 degrees panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment. Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic in the artificial intelligence research field today. Experimental results show that the function of the underwater drone achieved at diving in the leak automatically. The 360 degrees panoramic images were generated correctly. Fish recognition achieved 87% accuracy by deep learning.

AB Earthquake effects are strongly related with the properties of the local geology, amplifying the ground motion, especially in soft soils. This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support.

AB In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.

AB We present an open hardware and software platform to efficiently fuse heterogeneous sensor data in an automotive/robotic context. The framework presented in this paper provides researchers a base platform in order to develop and evaluate sensor fusion strategies. In contrast to similar approaches, this framework exploits in particular the raw radar data and enables the fusion at low-level.
   The proposed system utilizes low-level data from radar sensors as well as indirect (e.g. 3D imaging) and direct (e.g. LIDAR) Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors. After a configurable amount of pre-processing at sensor-level, the sensor data is transferred to a centralized platform and aligned temporally and spatially. We demonstrate the transformation of radar data into the 3D coordinate system in order to fuse it with point cloud data from ToF sensors. Due to the modular structure of the framework, it also enables the exploration of various system partitioning concepts.

AB Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) has attracted many users and researchers to apply the technique for various usages. However, EMS products for research purpose are limited and open source hardware still has limitations. We present a multi-channel EMS toolkit for researchers and designers to develop their original ideas. The toolkit was designed to have isolated multiple channels to be manipulated simultaneously, which allows simultaneous control of multiple body parts and multiple users. We organized a workshop with a theme of human augmentation, where EMS was not compelled to use. As a result, several groups found interest in using EMS for their development, and participants successfully used our toolkit for their presentation. We found that multi-channel EMS has a significant demand for human augmentation purposes.

AB Modern technologies of nowadays permanently ask for continual modification of teaching methods especially in the field of computer science. If teacher and students would like to follow the latest trends in this fast-growing and quick-changing area, teaching methods should be permanently developed. Technologies as Internet of Things (IoT), Web Design, Machine Learning or other current machineries constantly suffer from the lack of talented and skilled developers to independently manage and execute such projects. The situation reflects, on the one hand, to the deficiency of students willing to study these areas, on the other hand, to the ability of teachers to successfully adapt new trends from these areas into the education process. Based on our experience, it is possible to claim, that students can be easily motivated to work at all kind of applications if a way of their engagement is entertaining and pleasurable. Small and cheap mobile robotic platforms can serve this purpose. When the students can play with something what provides real feedback to them - blinking LED diode, lighting-up display, turning motors - they are motivated to work on it and consequently to learn something. It is called teaching by experience. With regards to mentioned, our team developed and introduced the mobile robotic platform applicable for showing the students basic principles of IoT application development. Upon the simple tasks, students first learn how to, through an introduced application programming interface (API), operate all the robot hardware. Afterwards they are headed for setting up their first application when they need to set up the server application and graphical user interface (GUI), implement the communication protocol and program the robot logic. The paper describes the platform in detail as well as the first experiences with its puffing into practice.

AB Yrobot is an open hardware platform developed by authors of this paper for students of computer science field of study. It was spread across high schools and universities in Slovakia for the purposes of teaching electronics and microcontrollers programming. The platform serves the purpose of a kit on which students can step-by-step gather some basic knowledge about the problematic of embedded systems development. They learn how to write, compile and transfer the code from computer into the microcontroller, as well as how to access all robot peripherals and how to implement the programming logic. C and C++ programming languages are used for this purpose. After the students goes through all programming tasks, they are skilled enough and pushed to design their own shield for Yrobot - supplementary hardware which provides additional functionality for the robot. The shield is connected via the expansion connectors to the robot and obviously improves the robot operation. In this paper, the implementation process of RaspberryPi extension for Yrobot is described. Such extension enables interconnection between the robot and RapberryPi which serves sufficient computing power enabling the robot of a real-time computer vision. Upon such prerequisites, special application which allows the robot to recognize the traffic signs was developed. On this application students gathered special knowledge of how to work with OpenCV library.

AB We have attempted to create affordable programmable logical controllers (PLC) that can be used to train millions of students in developing countries. Version 1 of the PLC is based on AtMega16 and costs (sic)600 ($10). Using the free and open source software (FOSS) LD Micro, one can learn ladder logic. To enhance the capabilities, using Raspberry PI, Version 2 of the PLC, costing (sic)1,500 ($25) is made. We can use this device with the FOSS OpenPLC to learn ladder logic. We can also learn function block based programming using the FOSS 4DIAC. As ladder logic and function block based programming are industrial standards, students trained using our approach will be useful to industry.

AB After a long-term debate and almost two years of legislative work, the Revenue Registry Act was adopted in the Czech Republic. The first and main reason for introducing the revenue registry was the lack of instruments of the Tax Administration to fight tax evasions. The second reason was the elimination of unfair competition based on gain of undue advantage by not paying the value added tax (VAT) and the income tax. The system of the revenue registry in the Czech Republic is founded on several principles that distinguish it from other systems based on a cash register or other systems of electronic evidence. The revenue registry is based on the principles of electronisation, on-line access of tax administrator to information, the possibility of voluntary public involvement into oversight and open hardware and software solution. Unfortunately, shortly after the adoption by the Parliament, the group of legislators started a case at the Constitutional Court, demanding the abolition of the Revenue Registry Act or at least some parts of the Act because of its unconstitutionality. They were partially successful and now the Ministry of Finance has been tasked with the preparation of an amendment to the Act. The goal of this contribution is to briefly introduce and describe the Revenue Registry Act, critically analyse the fundamental provisions of the Act, summarize pros and cons of the regulation, critically analyse the decision of the Constitutional Court and introduce the Ministry's proposal of amendments. The hypothesis that the electronic revenue registry is an effective tool for fair tax payments was neither confirmed nor disproved: The electronic revenue registry might be an effective tool for fair tax payments, but only in case of unified rules for all businessmen. The higher the number of exemptions is, the less effective tool the revenue registry is.

AB This research addresses the grave issue of plastic waste in the Pacific. By using Samoa as a case study, it was considered that distributed recycling combined with 3D printing offers an opportunity to (1) repurpose and add new value to this difficult waste stream and (2) engage diverse local communities in Samoa by combining notions of participatory design with traditional Samoan social concepts. Fieldwork in Samoa established the scope of the issue through interviews with stakeholders in government, waste management businesses, the arts and crafts community and education. Based on the information obtained from the fieldwork, potential product areas and designs were explored through material and 3D printing experiments using low-cost, open- source equipment. The experiments informed the design of speculative scenarios for workable, economically viable, socially empowering and sustainable systems for repurposing and upcycling plastic waste, which then enabled production of practically useful and culturally meaningful 3D printed objects, artefacts and products. Building upon the outcome and with a view towards implementation, Creative Pathways, an educational initiative aimed at propagating 3D printing and contextual design, was established and is being delivered in local schools.

AB The boreal forest ecosystem of Alberta is increasingly affected by the human development related to natural-resource extraction, pipelines, roads and seismic lines. To evaluate the efficiency of restoration treatments, this project aims at the monitoring of physical conditions and human/wildlife presence on a recovered seismic lines ecosystem. For monitoring human and animal uses of industrial linear features, an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype system is developed with open source hardware, and open interoperable IoT standard. We try to build an accurate and cost-effective tool to detect the impact of human footprint and monitor the habit of the wild animal. So we implemented four types of trail counter which is a low-cost, open-source measurement device that counts pedestrian, bikes, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), cars, and animals on trails, paths, and sidewalks.

ID BRADBURY-NIELSEN-GATE; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; RESOLVING POWER; RESOLUTION
AB Excluding the ion source, an ion mobility spectrometer is fundamentally comprised of drift chamber, ion gate, pulsing electronics, and a mechanism for amplifying and recording ion signals. Historically, the solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled, MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output of this circuit follows a TTL signal with similar to 20 ns rise and fall times, pulses up to +/- 200 V, and is entirely isolated using fiber optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental efforts for future comparison.

AB The advent of easy-to-use open source microcontrollers, off-the-shelf electronics and customizable manufacturing technologies has facilitated the development of inexpensive scientific devices and laboratory equipment. In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering. All the resources developed here are available under open source licenses.

AB This article describes a complete characterization system for photovoltaic devices designed to acquire the current-voltage curve and to process the obtained data. The proposed system can be replicated for educational or research purposes without having wide knowledge about electronic engineering. Using standard calibrated instrumentation, commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing the results obtained from some commercial photovoltaic modules to the measurements given by an independently accredited laboratory.

AB The race to achieve smart cities is producing a continuous effort to adapt new developments and knowledge, for administrations and citizens. Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources.
   The proliferation of these "smart things" is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments.
   This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over "smart things" as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This letter presents the depth control of an autonomous micro diving agent called autonomous diving agent (ADA). ADA consists of off-the-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware. It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks. We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles.

AB Working together, heated and unheated temperature sensors can recognize contact with different materials and contact with the human body. As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

AB As the open source development of additive manufacturing has led to low-cost desktop three-dimensional (3-D) printing, a number of scientists throughout the world have begun to share digital designs of free and open source scientific hardware. Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20 degrees platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US$37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities. The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs.

DT Article

AB This paper presents a data acquisition unit which synchronously samples multiple channels in a manner such that the time of day at which each sample is taken is known. This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated. Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid integration with popular numerical simulation environments.

AB In the era of the forth Industrial Revolution, open source code and open source hardware have gained much attention. In particular, 3D printing technology is expanding into the realms of classical science, technology and our daily lives. Relatedly, in the present study, we demonstrate the manufacture of a nano-LC MALDI spotter robot using 3D printing technology. The parts of the spotter robot were either made using a 3D printer or purchased as 3D printer parts from the 3D printer online market, so that anyone can make the robot without a deep knowledge of engineering or electronics, i.e., DIY (do-it-yourself) product. In the nano-LC MALDI spotter, the nano-LC eluent and MALDI matrix were mixed in a T-union and discharged from the capillary outlet. The eluent and matrix mixture could be spotted onto the movable MALDI plate. The MALDI plate was designed to translate in a two-dimensional space (xy plane), which was enabled by the movements of two stepper motors. In the paper, all computer-aided design (CAD) files for the parts and operation software are provided to help the reader manufacture their own spotter robot.

AB Objective. Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.

TI OPTiM: Optical projection tomography integrated microscope using
   open-source hardware and software
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB We describe the implementation of an OPT plate to perform optical projection tomography (OPT) on a commercial wide-field inverted microscope, using our open-source hardware and software. The OPT plate includes a tilt adjustment for alignment and a stepper motor for sample rotation as required by standard projection tomography. Depending on magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed at magnifications >4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to similar to 1.6 mu m). All three methods use the microscope's existing incoherent light source (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for day-to-day use. OPT acquisitions are performed on in vivo zebrafish embryos to demonstrate the implementations' viability.

AB Most initiatives about embedded sensing capabilities in computational systems lead to devise an ad hoc sensor platform, usually poorly reusable, as a first stage to prepare a data corpus or production prototype. In this paper, an open source hardware platform for sensing is described. This platform was intended to be used in data acquisition for gait identification, and is designed in a way general enough so many other projects could reuse the design to accelerate prototyping. The platform is based on popular open source hardware and software like Arduino and Raspberry Pi using well known languages and libraries. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz.

AB Since 2001, the departments of Electrical and Electronics and Information and Communication Electronics Engineering of Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) have jointly given a lecture on autonomous electronic information devices for undergraduate students. According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an input', output', and some information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking introduced by Rene Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement, open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future directions.

ID EDUCATION; SYSTEMS; ARDUINO; WORKS
AB In engineering, traditional approaches aimed at teaching concepts of dynamics to engineering students include the study of a dense yet sequential theoretical development of proofs and exercises. Structural dynamics are seldom taught experimentally in laboratories since these facilities should be provided with expensive equipment such as wave generators, data-acquisition systems, and heavily wired deployments with sensors. In this paper, the design of an experimental experience in the classroom based upon digital fabrication and modeling tools related to structural dynamics is presented. In particular, all experimental deployments are conceived with low-cost, open-source equipment. The hardware includes Arduino-based open-source electronics whereas the software is based upon object-oriented open-source codes for the development of physical simulations. The set of experiments and the physical simulations are reproducible and scalable in classroom-based environments.

AB In the past decades, bioassays and whole-organism bioassay have become important tools not only in compliance testing of industrial chemicals and plant protection products, but also in the monitoring of environmental quality. With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.

AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are increasingly gaining interest as a source of renewable energy. These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary.

AB As low-cost desktop 3D printing is now dominated by free and open source self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap) derivatives, there is an intense interest in extending the scope of potential applications to manufacturing. This study describes a manufacturing technology that enables a constrained set of polymer-metal composite components. This paper provides (1) free and open source hardware and (2) software for printing systems that achieves metal wire embedment into a polymer matrix 3D-printed part via a novel weaving and wrapping method using (3) OpenSCAD and parametric coding for customized g-code commands. Composite parts are evaluated from the technical viability of manufacturing and quality. The results show that utilizing a multi-polymer head system for multi-component manufacturing reduces manufacturing time and reduces the embodied energy of manufacturing. Finally, it is concluded that an open source software and hardware tool chain can provide low-cost industrial manufacturing of complex metal-polymer composite-based products.

AB We are developing room temperature electronics based upon the ROACH platform to readout microwave multiplexed X-ray TES. ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data.

TI Openspritzer: an open hardware pressure ejection system for reliably
   delivering picolitre volumes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that has been accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware.

AB This paper shows new possibilities of using novel, open-source, low-cost platforms for the structural health monitoring of heritage structures. The objective of the study is to present an assessment of increasingly available open-source digital modeling and fabrication technologies in order to identify the suitable counterparts of the typical components of a continuous static monitoring system for a historical construction. The results of the research include a simple case study, which is presented with low-cost, open-source, calibrated components, as well as an assessment of different alternatives for deploying basic structural health monitoring arrangements. The results of the research show the great potential of these existing technologies that may help to promote a widespread and cost-efficient monitoring of the built cultural heritage. Such scenario may contribute to the onset of commonplace digital records of historical constructions in an open-source, versatile and reliable fashion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB We describe the use of a low-cost commercial flatbed scanner in the undergraduate teaching laboratory to image large (similar to 25 cm) interference and diffraction patterns in two dimensions. Such scanners usually have an 8-bit linear photosensor array that can scan large areas (similar to 28 cm x 22 cm) at very high spatial resolutions (similar to 100 Megapixels), which makes them versatile large-format imaging devices. We describe how the scanner can be used to image interference and diffraction from rectangular single-slit, double-slit, and circular apertures. The experiments are very simple to setup and require no specialized components besides a small laser and a flatbed scanner. Due to the presence of Automatic Gain Control in the scanner, which we were not able to override, we were unable to get an excellent fit to the data. Interestingly, we found that the less-than-ideal data were actually pedagogically superior as it forced the students to think about the process of data acquisition in much greater detail instead of simply performing the experiment mechanically.

AB Isaac Newton famously observed that "if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." We propose that this sentiment is a powerful motivation for the "open-source" movement in scientific research, in which creators provide everything needed to replicate a given project online, as well as providing explicit permission for users to use, improve, and share it with others. Here, we write to introduce analytical chemists who are new to the open-source movement to best practices and concepts in this area and to survey the state of open source research in analytical chemistry. We conclude by considering two examples of open-source projects from our own research group, with the hope that a description of the process, motivations, and results will provide a convincing argument about the benefits that this movement brings to both creators and users.

AB We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet our understanding and attachment to them is rather limited. One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.

AB Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is considered to be a major driving innovation in tissue engineering, since a custom-made manufacturing for patients is essential for tissue and organ generation. Depending on the bio-materials and the applications, various 3D bio-printing technologies are used. A system capable of printing a variety of bio-materials through various methods is required for fabrication of hybrid scaffolds for tissue engineering research. This paper describes the design and integration of a multi-channel 3D bio-printing system at an affordable price based on open source hardware and software. The hardware and software components of the 3D bio-printing system and the process of finding optimal printing conditions are described in the paper. Fabrication of the hybrid scaffold of synthetic polymer and cell loaded hydrogel are presented to validate the performance of the system.

AB The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A mobile sensor network to map carbon dioxide emissions in urban
   environments
SO ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB A method for directly measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using a mobile sensor network in cities at fine spatial resolution was developed and tested. First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x 100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to 226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2) = 47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance.

AB In this study, we introduce a modulation strategy for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) by using a simple and consumable-free modulator. This "Do-It-Yourself" interface comprised a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories.

AB Three dimensional (3d) printer technologies are rapidly developing and increasingly being used in several fields. In this study, as a first step a 3d printer is constructed by modifying open source hardware and controlled by improving open source software. Subsequently, an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) is designed and constructed by using this 3d printer.
   The ankle foot orthosis, very important for human walking, is designed to control motion of the ankle and prevents deformities. An AFO can generally be used for following purposes: brace weak limbs, grasp ankle and foot in the right position and correct the foot drop. Since the users have different sizes of ankles and different types of deformities, an AFO must be produced to match in size to the end-user. Therefore off-the-shelf AFOs may not suitable for the each end user. Considering these factors, 3d printers are of great importance for producing individualized biomedical equipment. In this study, a distinctive ankle foot orthosis is first modelled by using CAD software and then produced by using constructed 3d printer. This AFO is the first ankle foot orthosis produced by a 3d printer in the literature of our country. This study is a proof that biomedical equipments can be produced in a shorter time and less costly by using 3d printers.

AB A portable probe based on open hardware architecture for the assessment of soil thermal properties and water content using the DPHP method is presented. The mean percentage errors for assessment of volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity were 4.6% and 8.9% respectively, computed after sensor spacing calibration in agar stabilized water. The DPHP probe has been tested for soil thermal properties assessment and compared to TDR probe for the water content estimation in four different soils.
   The DPHP probe showed an accuracy comparable to TDR in estimating water content, with DPHP showing lower values of error index in 3 samples out of 4. The DPHP can be used to investigate smaller volume of soil than TDR probe can do however, TDR is much faster than DPHP in measure acquisition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work proposes a system for collecting meteorological data using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), that is able to transmit data in real-time. The system automatizes the process of collecting the data in a continuous manner for long periods of time, for this, the module is equipped with a source of solar energy that allows autonomous operation. In order to obtain viability of design and prototype implementation, the construction of two systems was proposed based on DigiMesh and Wi-Fi; those prototypes could be applied to different scenarios such as urban and rural areas. Additionally, it was performed an evaluation of broadcasting of information to platforms of Internet of Things (IoT), where the data collected by the nodes will be managed and displayed. This system was conceived as a low-cost alternative compared with conventional weather stations that offer these facilities and are based on free hardware and software components. Finally, the validation of the obtained results was performed using a statistical analysis with the collected data of the weather station Davis Vantage Pro, obtaining a maximum average relative error of 4.93%.

AB Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.

AB Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.

AB A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system, nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The systemallows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recordedwith a 24-bit EEGsystemwithminimumbandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication.

This home automation system allows the end user to monitor his home or office with a smartphone, tablet, or any computer. This paper also explains the use of the security system for fire hazards that may occur due to a gas leakage and can be detected using a smoke sensor. It uses a low power NRF24L trans-receiver at each node around the house to create a mesh network that connects to a Linux based central hub. Users can monitor the house from anywhere and get periodic alerts. In the proposed work, the house can also be controlled using voice commands such as Google Voice, Apple HomeKit and Alexa.

AB Drowsy driving is the primary cause of motor vehicle accidents and is a risk factor that leads to the loss of human life, remaining as a challenge for the global automotive industry. Recently, drowsy monitoring system has been actively studied for prediction system based machine learning. However, the challenges of automotive real-time constraints and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from vehicle network and other device. To solve this problem, we propose drowsy monitoring system based machine learning using GS1 standard. First, vehicle motion data is defined and modeled using the GS1 standard language for drowsy predict. Second, we propose an optimal algorithm selection and detail architecture for automotive real-time environments through machine learning algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM). Finally, we describe system-wide integration and implementation through the open source hardware Raspberry Pi and the machine learning SW framework We provide optimal LSTM architecture and implementation that takes into account the real-time environmental conditions and how to improve the readability and usability of the vehicle motion data. We also share the rapid prototyping methodology case of connected car systems without other sensor devices.

AB There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)-this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS-located on the user's computer. The proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented.

AB How can STS researchers collaborate with communities to design environmental monitoring devices that more effectively express their experiences and address gaps in regulation? This paper describes and shows the results of a novel method of visualizing environmental emissions of corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure using photographic paper. H2S is a neurotoxic and flammable gas that smells like rotten eggs and is frequently associated with oil and natural gas extraction. Communities living with oil and gas development in Wyoming report odors of rotten eggs and describe symptoms of H2S exposure. H2S is recognized as an acute and chronic threat to human and environmental health and oil and gas companies are required to have plans in place to prevent and respond to accidental, high concentration releases of H2S. They are not, however, required to monitor, report or prevent routine daily emissions. Yet 15-25% of the oil and gas wells in the US are predicted to contain H2S, and some communities surrounded by multiple wells report chronic, routine exposure. Chronic exposure is difficult to represent with current tools for monitoring H2S because they are designed to measure acute workplace exposure. Informed by STS theories of black boxes and regimes of imperceptibility that focus on the need to revise not only regulations but also material tools of science, this paper describes the development of an indexical approach to visualizing this hazard. In indexical design, the reactive sensing element of a scientific instrument is brought to the foreground. The silver in the photopaper is an index as it tarnishes with H2S exposure. Discolored tests strips can be arranged together to form data-rich maps of the exposure landscape where this discoloration both represents how the gas spreads through a space and is a physical trace of the gas. Preliminary results in the form of data-rich maps show that regulating H2S emissions as primarily accidental is inappropriate and fails to adequately protect human health.

AB This paper presents a novel method of automating experimental measurements in a laboratory environment. The acquisition and analysis of experimental data is possible using electronic sensors, open source software and hardware environment that makes the whole process simpler. This paper presents an experimental environment of testing of a centrifugal pump. However, the same approach can be extended to similar experiments that involve measurement of various parameters. In this experiment pressures, flow rate and speed that are essential parameters in a typical pump testing is measured using sensors and interfaced with the open source hardware Arduino. The advantage of using this approach is easy readability, more accurate and time saving. Different sensors that are used and calibration procedures involved are explained. The instrument chain consisting of sensors, Arduino and personal computer needed for the analysis of acquired data is explained.

AB Robotics is one of the major disruptive technologies of our time, and offers significant opportunities for innovation and competitiveness in the global marketplace. However, in resource-poor countries like India, engineering education is hampered by a lack of access to affordable and innovative hands-on practical education modules for the laboratory. This is especially the case in emerging disciplines like robotics. Moreover, expensive commercial grade robots offer limited scope for experimentation and learning outcomes in an academic setting. This situation can be remedied with the increasing affordability and versatility of open source hardware like microcontrollers and microcomputers, commercial off-the-shelf components like motors, actuators, sensors and power transmission mechanisms, as well as free, open source software. In this paper, a low-cost build your own (BYO) three-link electrically actuated robot manipulator is designed and developed for adoption in robotics and mechatronics laboratory courses. It can be disseminated and adapted on a wide scale at affordable cost for hands-on manufacturing education.

AB Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can consume a large percentage of the energy used in a typical building. Intelligent building automation systems (BAS) are widely deployed to enable more efficient HVAC utilization, thus reducing the energy consumed. Enhanced data requires distributed sensing. We propose an instrumentation system for a low-cost, over-the-top efficiency monitor using the open-source hardware design to enable rapid deployment and live monitoring of temperature within zones such as rooms. This enables evaluation of HVAC system efficiency, and building parameter monitoring in that room. This paper presents our HVAC, thermal, and building parameter monitoring system design and considerations using an open-source hardware approach for fast customizations. We show results of monitoring two buildings including distributed sensing within rooms, and discuss intelligence gathered through use of this system as a precursor towards a fully automated efficiency evaluation and measurement.

AB Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the number of sensors. Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage.

AB Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks, can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality.

AB This paper designs and implements a smart garden system that can be used inside the house. To do this, we used particle filter and environmental sensors, which are open hardware controllers, and designed to control and observe automatic water supply, lighting, and growth monitoring with three wireless systems (Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi). This system has been developed to make it possible to use it in an indoor space such as an apartment, rather than a large-scale cultivation system such as a conventional plant factory which has already been widely used. The developed system collects environmental data by using soil sensor, illuminance sensor, humidity sensor and temperature sensor as well as control through smartphone app, analyzes the collected data, and controls water pump, LED lamp, air ventilation fan and so on. As a wireless remote control method, we implemented Bluetooth, Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Finally, it is designed for users to enable remote control and monitoring when the user is not in the house.

AB The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high. Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this investigation, a neuro-adaptive control scheme where the rule for parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control system for brushless synchronous servomotors. The experimental tests have been carried on using compact and flexible, based on open hardware and software concept, dual-axis motion controllers PMC201/PMC202 manufactured by the PicoMotion Inc. The applied software has been written using the Motion Control Framework software platform, provided together with the above controllers. The results obtained with the proposed neuro-adaptive control scheme have been compared to those obtained using the originally built into the system PI controller. The experiments have shown that the implemented advanced adaptive control approach is practically viable and can be embedded into the industrial motion control systems which will lead to their improved performance.

AB In the last few years, a demand for renewed product personalisation to satisfy the exact need of the customers has been observed in some markets. As opposed to customisation, which put emphasis on the satisfaction of explicit needs of a defined market segment, individualisation aims at satisfying the specific needs of a customer. Product design for Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design paradigm that comprises an open hardware platform and multiple modules that are integrated with the platform, as per end-users' choice. This paper identifies key areas and components which need to be focused to realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an explorative study of existing product design and customisation approaches. A questionnaire survey has been conducted and results are presented for the industrial implication and insights on this approach. The findings clearly show that MI provides most individualised and technologically advanced product.

AB This paper deals with e-learning design and development training courses, more precisely with remote training by practical activities of laboratory experiments (E-Lab). Indeed. the majority of remote training platforms offer theoretical courses and a few practical activities. which are essential in training theoretical Science and Technology. In order to share the costly equipment, in this work, we propose an open hardware/software architecture allowing remote access to a laboratory equipment by designing in Matlab two graphical interfaces using Internet/Intranet network and TCP/IP communication protocol. A real-time control and supervision is performed to carry out all the practical activity according to a pedagogical scenario elaborated by the trainer. The use of these interfaces is illustrated by educational sessions articulated on the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) regulation and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) of temperature control system. The challenge of elaborating a remote practical activity with pedagogical effectiveness is accomplished in the above proposed solution. All the hardware and software that made available the remote experimentation platform give possibility to achieve others traditional activities in experimentation laboratory.

AB Pain, one of the most urgent of all senses, is almost constant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Several means of pain assessment have been described and are being used in all NICUs, however there is no means of detection and signal the caregiver that a neonatal patient is in pain.
   Therefore, using an open-source hardware and NICU's most frequent patient monitoring device (the pulseoximeter) we created a cheap technological system of vital signs data acquisition and caregiver signaling in the event of pain in patient in the NICU.

AB This paper presents the Pi-puck extension board - an interface between the e-puck robot platform and a Raspberry Pi single-board computer that enhances the processing power, memory capacity, and networking capabilities of the robot at a low cost. It allows high-level control algorithms, wireless communication, and computationally expensive operations such as real-time image processing to be handled by a Raspberry Pi, while the e-puck's microcontroller deals with low-level motor control and sensor interfacing.
   Although two similar extension boards for the e-puck robot platform already exist, they are now out-dated and expensive in comparison. Our open-source hardware design and supporting software infrastructure offer an inexpensive upgrade to the e-puck robot, transforming it into the Pi-puck - a modern and flexible new platform for mobile robotics research.

AB This paper reflects on the dynamics and practices of building a maker community around a new hardware platform. We examine the factors promoting the successful uptake of a maker platform from two perspectives: first, we investigate the technical and user experience considerations that users identify as the most important. Second, we explore the specific activities that help attract a community and encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on the relationship between the platform and the community and offer suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in establishing their own maker communities.

   performance; real-time systems
AB Because of the rapid development of EtherCAT as the standard fieldbus in control and automation and the increasing demands of low cost portable main controllers, we aim to assess the performance of an EtherCAT network in handling real-time demands using open source EtherCAT master protocol on open hardware platforms. In comparison to that of commercial products, the performance of open platforms is still indefinite and may depend on different indicators such as the kernel version, real-time architecture, and the protocol of EtherCAT. This paper provides implementation guidelines and procedures to develop the embedded platforms-a task which is difficult due to lack of systematic documents and technical support. The real-time evaluation of an open source EtherCAT master with a dual-kernel approach of real-time embedded Linux, Xenomai, is performed to validate that even low-cost open embedded hardware platforms are also capable in performing real-time EtherCAT control applications.

AB Open source hardware projects are becoming more and more common. OpenRISC SOC, one of the prominent of these projects, has become quite popular with the support of volunteer developers. In this work, we have demonstrated the design of an DES (Data Encryption Standard) based system, that can be used in security applications, on ORPSoC-v2 (Openrisc Reference Platform System-on-Chip). Additionally, we have showed that the system works successfully with a sample C application on an FPGA. This work emphasizes design security and flexibility features of open source systems against alternative closed source solutions. Another purpose of this study is to establish a platform for future studies on the analysis of side channel attacks.

AB Particulate matter pollution becomes an increasingly important problem in developing countries and poses a hazard to human health especially in indoor environment. At the same time, modern buildings are equipped with advanced sensing and control technologies, offering control and optimisation capabilities over a large range of parameters. This paper proposes an open platform of a WiFi-enabled indoor air quality monitoring and control system, which could be incorporated into such a 'smart building' structure. The complete software and hardware design of this system is presented, along with a series of control experiments. The proposed system operates over an existing WiFi wireless network utilising the MQTT protocol. It is capable of monitoring the indoor air quality as well as controlling an air purifier to regulate the particulate matters concentration. Experiment results under a real world office environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

AB Tangible learning is a promising branch, especially for scientific learning, allowing an enhanced sensorial involvement and participation by children. While a lot is being done on the side of programming, less has been investigated on elementary spatial and geometric concepts. The paper presents i-Vertex, an open -hardware framework for tangible serious games on geometry concepts for primary school pupils. The framework targets spatial reasoning and includes music as a related and complementary feature, which should add value also for usability. i-Vertex supports collaboration between kids and the key role of a teacher as an adult that interacts with the children in different ways, introducing them to the discovery and understanding of basic geometric concepts and physical phenomenon. At present, we have built a prototype, featuring a very limited number of vertices, and functionally tested it in lab, in two main scenarios covering topics such as lines and triangles. Based on the successful feedback of this experiment, we intend to proceed further, upgrading the platform with a more powerful and product oriented micro-controller and board.

AB This paper introduces a newly developed Object Oriented Open Software Architecture designed for supporting security applications, while leveraging on the capabilities offered by dedicated Open Hardware devices. Specifically, we target the the SEcubeTM platform, an Open Hardware security platform based on a 3D SiP (System on Package) designed and produced by Blu5 Group. The platform integrates three components employed for security in a single package: a Cortex-M4 CPU, a FPGA and an EAL5+ certified Smart Card. The Open Software Architecture targets both the host machine and the security device, together with the secure communication among them. To maximize its usability, this architecture is organized in several abstraction layers, ranging from hardware interfaces to device drivers, from security APIs to advanced applications, like secure messaging and data protection. We aim at releasing a multi-platform Open Source security framework, where software and hardware cooperate to hide to both the developer and the final users classical security concepts like cryptographic algorithms and keys, focusing, instead, on common operational security concepts like groups and policies.

AB Since the demand for more bandwidth, agile infrastructures and services grows, it becomes challenging for Service Providers like GEANT to manage the proprietary underlay, while keeping costs low. In such a scenario, Software Defined Networking (SDN), open hardware and open source software prove to be key components to address those challenges. After one year of development, SDX-L2 and BoD, the SDN-ization of the GEANT Open and Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) services, have been brought to the pilot status and GEANT is now testing the outcomes on its operational network. In this demonstration, we show BoD and SDX-L2 "going live" at the GEANT production infrastructure. The pilots run on the same underlay infrastructure thanks to the virtualization capabilities of the network devices. Provisioning of the services is covered during the demo. In the final steps of the demonstration, we show how the infrastructure is able to automatically manage network events and how it remains operational in the case of fault events.

AB Currently, more and more organizations are aware of the increasing potential of nanoscience and nanotechnology, due to the wide field of innovative applications they address from biomedical and molecular technology to semiconductor and material sciences. Nanotechnology is an area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones, cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanoeye project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics, software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first functional structure of Nanoeye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic Control Demonstrators.

AB There is a lack of a number of relevant technologies relevant to modern development of curriculum in robotics for secondary and higher educational institutions in Russia. In the presented work, the question of the creation educational materials on robotics, mechatronics, control theory and the introduction of a design-based learning in the teaching of robotics is being studied. Ultra-mobile chassis for service robots that can overcome obstacles up to a meter in height was developed. It has open hardware and software architecture and can be a platform for student start-ups, experiments, diploma works. Simple integration with other existing technologies and algorithms for mobile robots. Simulation environment for virtual programming of each hardware complex is provided. Educational and methodological materials and laboratory work on robotics, control theory, mechatronics, mathematical modeling. Separation of tasks, the joint construction of a mathematical model and the programming of a complex robotic system. The main emphasis in training is on the solution of model problems, the project approach is widely used. Such tasks can become a basis for individual course and diploma papers, for example, creating robots for the various scenarios. This educational platform is tested in the course "Introduction to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence" at the Kuban State University, Krasnodar.

ID CHIP; NETWORK
AB The chip industry faces two key challenges today the impending end of Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and domain-specific accelerators - are a promising answer to the first challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-and-play designs can help with the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-and-play SoC environment is an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area - and yet be flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency increases proportional to the number of hops.
   In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART(1). SMART is a recently proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multi-hop on-chip traversals within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs, enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of user-specified network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on. OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today. OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download(2) and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging IPs.

AB Weather stations are a valuable tool to many different areas, like agriculture, aviation, construction, sports and recreation, specially because they collect weather data, which can be stored and processed to gather specific information to correlate events to the weather action. This work shows a development model of a low cost weather station, using only free hardware and software, connected to the internet, giving real time data taken from the station, as well as history of the stored data. This station, even though using low cost or handcrafted sensors, like those that measure wind speed, wind direction and rainfall index, showed consistent results costing only 10% of the price, in comparison with some professional weather stations, allowing its popularization in agriculture, homes and institutions.

AB Robotics has been used to draw the attention of young students to computing and engineering. Unfortunately, most hardware and software resources used to teach programming and robotics are not adequate for students with visual impairment (VI). For instance, most programming environments for young students are highly visual and the commercial robotics kits were not built for people with VI. This paper describes the main design requirements so that both the proposed robot hardware and the software can also be used by people with VI. The hardware part is the focus of this paper, a robot called Donnie. It consists of open hardware, a design with low-cost and easy to find parts, and a 3D printed structure. Our main contribution is the presentation of a low-cost Arduino-based robot, compatible with Player robotic framework and integrated with sound feedback and text-to-speech.

AB An open hardware framework for approximating range and bearing of radio frequency (RF) sensors is presented. The current work has an immediate application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360 degrees has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing. The proposed hardware setup is validated through a set of experimental results gathered in an indoor environment.

AB Open Source Hardware allows users to share, customize, and improve designs, thus enabling technological advancement through communities of practice. We propose open source hardware for educational haptics that permits researchers, educators, and students to share designs arising from their different perspectives, with the potential to expand educational applications. In this paper we present a family of open source kinesthetic haptic devices that build upon the design of a previous educational haptic device, Hapkit 3.0. First, we discuss methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit 3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small number of additional parts to transform them into a two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering and non-engineering students. Open source designs for all devices as well as tutorials for customization are available at http://hapkit.stanford.edu.

AB An efficient practical method for bipolar transistor application for neutron fluence registration is presented. The method is focused on neutron fluences damage effect correlation for various sources to reference source. The bipolar transistor connection diagram and an example of device realization based on STM32 microcontroller are described. STM32 is used for providing test signals and parameter registration used for gain factor calculation of bipolar transistors monitor (BTM). The proposed approach allows considering the features of pre-irradiated at reference source BTM and their application as the neutron fluence monitors. These connection diagram and constructive solutions provide "on-line" neutron fluence registration for different sources in terms of reference source as required for radiation tests results verification.

AB Mixed-reality environments allow to combine tangible interaction with digital feedback, empowering interaction designers to take benefits from both real and virtual worlds. This interaction paradigm is also being applied in classrooms for learning purposes. However, most of the times the devices supporting mixed-reality interaction are neither portable nor affordable, which could be a limitation in the learning context. In this paper we propose CETA, a mixed-reality environment using low-cost Android tablets which tackles portability and costs issues. In addition, CETA is open-source, reproducible and extensible.

AB Although there are a large number of autonomous robot platforms for ground contact and flying robots, this has not been the case for underwater robotic platforms. This is not due to the lack of interesting applications in the shallow underwater domain (50m depth), but rather due to the relative cost of building such platforms. This has recently changed with the development of inexpensive thrusters and other underwater components. Leveraging these components and design principles learned from more expensive remotely operated vehicles this paper describes Milton, an inexpensive open hardware design for a traditional thruster-based underwater robot. Utilizing commercial off-the-shelf hardware and a ROS infrastructure, Milton, and Milton-inspired designs provide an inexpensive platform for autonomous underwater vehicle research.

AB The concept of quality of life is used as a measure of the welfare of a society, highlighting the relationship between the environment and health, mainly associated with pollution. Hence the importance of monitoring and communicating its results, in a timely manner, to the community. But often the last part of the process fail, there is a lack of communication between data, information and community. Using open hardware and open source tools, and based on the Internet of things concept, a low-cost citizen monitoring network, that cost less than US $150 was implemented. This network measures Carbon Monoxide (CO), Temperature, Relative Humidity, Particulate Matter 2.5, Noise and UV radiation, with a reading frequency of every 40 s and a hibernation period of 15 min. The environmental monitoring network gather information from the environment, through sensors, and then store it in a MySQL database, to finally be deployed in a web site hosted on a local web server Apache, implemented ex professo. In effect, the system is able to deliver geotagged information and the state of environmental pollution to the citizens.

DE gesture recognition; accelerometers; sensors; micro-controller;

AB The primary objective of the paper is to construct and test a low-cost, minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static gestures efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335 accelerometer sensors which track the gestures and these sensors are interfaced with an Arduino ATMega 2560 micro-controller for data processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible algorithm which requires only nominal resources to recognize the gestures. The paper further elucidates on minimizing the number of accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption of the system. The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained from 3 trained ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the proposed system with a maximum and minimum configuration of 5 and 2 accelerometers was found to be 95.3% and 87.0%, with the cost of these prototype systems being realized at 20 USD and 12.5 USD respectively. It was also found that the system can be trained for the static gestures of the alphabets in ASL under two minutes by a new-user with any system configuration. The authors also feel that the system is compatible with other IoT platforms for interoperability.

   Peltier; Open-hardware; Internet of Things (IoT) application
AB Currently, the water crisis is not only visible in Brazil but almost everywhere and it arises where water scarcity becomes a global challenge or environmental concerns about the shortage of drinking water. The need to have water available for consumption is critical, since, in turn, it is the main source for life on Earth. Despite all of Earth's water found, only 2.5% of it is freshwater. From this smallest part, 70% of it is used in agriculture, 23% by industries and 7% for human consumption. This paper presents an embedded system prototype for air dehumidifying which has the main purpose of obtaining water (by means of condensation). Others benefits include low cost, low size, portability and an Internet of Things application approach. The dehumidifier uses an aluminum plate around 36 cm(2) and about 0.5 mm thickness, a thermoelectric Peltier tablet, a breadboard UNO R3 arduino, wires jumper, transistors TIP122 and 1 K Omega (Ohm) resistors. Within the initial results, we verified the condensed water in the aluminum and the formation of water repeatedly and controlled.

AB In this paper, we present a low-cost approach to upgrade an outdated PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) 560 robot in order to widen the number and type of possible hands-on experiments in control and instrumentation education. Another aim of the upgrade is to enable its future connection to a remote laboratory. We propose a scalable structure to control and monitoring PUMA560 motors. This approach combines several different technologies: A Raspberry Pi for control and monitoring, Python to control the system and chart data, as well as converters and drivers with serial I2C bus interface connectivity to read/write data from/to Puma560 robot. The ideas here explained could be applicable to other physical systems with similar characteristics and number of variables.

AB This paper presents the results of the development of a modular open source platform for experimental control setups. This platform emerged from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the form of a modular platform for real-time control.
   The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing, observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost hardware and free software especially suited for flight control experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware developers and control engineers.

AB Enabled by modern languages and retargetable compilers, software development is in a virtual "Cambrian explosion" driven by a critical mass of powerfully parameterized libraries; but hardware development practices lag far behind. We hypothesize that existing hardware construction languages (HCLs) and novel hardware compiler frameworks (HCFs) can put hardware development on a similar evolutionary path by enabling new hardware libraries to be independent of underlying process technologies including FPGA mappings. We support this claim by (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses, optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach.

ID OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
AB Following the successful adoption of the open source model in the software realm, open source is becoming a new design paradigm in hardware development. Open source models for tangible products are still in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and founders of twenty-three companies were interviewed to understand their motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2) Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur whose identity is as a for-profit company leader.

AB Arduino boards, a current trending open-source platform technology, are being used by museums and other institutions to create interactive exhibits for their patrons. Academic libraries are often faced with the challenge of finding new inspirations to educate and engage patrons. The Illuminated Lifestyles exhibit at Binghamton University was an attempt to teach library users about the sensory experiences of medieval manuscripts using touch technology. Relatively inexpensive, these boards can be incorporated in various ways to make an exhibit interactive. In this case, the boards were used in conjunction with large-scale frames covered with digitized replicas of manuscript leaves that spoke to the viewer as they touched the images. This case study explains the technology and platforms used within the exhibit and what the long-term impacts and benefits, if any, the library experienced.

AB In this paper a new open-source and open-hardware framework for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) control is described. The hardware is based on CIAA (Computadora Industrial Abierta Argentina) and Arduino modules while the software is based on NuttX real-time operating system (RTOS). For communication, the MAVlink protocol is used, also enabling interfacing with ROS (Robot Operating System). The framework can be employed for different style UGVs (differential drive, omnidirectional, skid steer) with different number of motorized wheels. It is designed for low-cost and ease of integration and adoption. The proposed framework was employed as the control system of a four-wheel skid-steer rover protoype developed by the authors, which is also described as a part of this work.

AB Precision aquaculture is a new tool developed in the field of information technology (IT) that allows the farmers having a better control of the farm processes, facilitate the decisions making, and improve the efficiency of the activity. The development of systems for continuous monitoring are important to aquaculture crops since these can detect unwanted conditions that can be harmful for organisms. In this study, are valued open hardware and artificial intelligence as alternative platforms to develop new monitoring systems. The proposed system automatically records the physicochemical variables of the water (dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH) and processes them using fuzzy logic (artificial intelligence) for the determination of the water quality index. The system was tested in a shrimp culture (Litopenaeus vannamei) with a size of 1.67 +/- 0.23g in a period of 84 days. The results show that the system analyzes the physicochemical variables most important of a shrimp culture and were able to qualify as a water quality index: poor, good and excellent according to the optimal thresholds required by the crop. This indicates that it is possible the use of the open hardware and fuzzy logic system for the monitoring of water quality index and its application in aquaculture.

DT Article
DE Air pollution; crowdsourcing; environmental monitoring; Internet of

AB As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future.

AB Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power WideArea Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-toend LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.

AB The OpenOrbiter CubeSat Development Initiative is working to build a small spacecraft system using open source software and open hardware principles. Some important design considerations for the CubeSat are nonfunctional requirements. The key contribution of this work is presenting the design of a requirement engineering tool that can be used to speed up the requirement elicitation and specification of system-wide qualities such as availability, performance, and security based on the use of quality attribute scenarios. A prototype application, utilizing the concept of quality attribute scenarios which was originally proposed by the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI), was designed and implemented. These quality attribute scenarios are the equivalent of UML scenarios and use-cases. They are built specifically to document the nonfunctional requirements and use a quality scenario template.

AB In pursuit of coping mechanisms for the challenges of sustainable manufacturing, systematic methods have been developed to allow engineers to improve the ratio between products' utility and environmental impact. These necessary efforts remain however limited if the surrounding production and consumption practices are not called into question at the same time. This article introduces open source product development as a potential approach for unlocking the limits of existing sustainable product design practices and to lead towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption practices termed as participative production. First, it discusses the potential advantages of this emerging practice in terms of environmental sustainability. Second, it provides a screened qualitative environmental analysis of 18 exemplary open source hardware products. Specific sustainable design principles implemented by these products are highlighted and discussed in order to identify challenges for further common research in the field of open source and sustainable product development.

AB With the rapid growth of a number of elderly people around the world, an increasing need has arisen in providing physical security to them. Researchers have been working in developing such monitoring systems for the past decades. However, the needs of elderly people and their families are yet to be fulfilled, especially since the developed existing systems need their users to change their lifestyles. This work aims at suggesting a system for monitoring the occupancy of an elderly person on the bed. Capacitive proximity sensing system has been proven to be a probable solution for indoor localization, which senses the presence of a human body. Nevertheless, the requirements for installation are many, which make the integration costly. In this paper, a flexible and integrated solution is proposed that makes use of inexpensive, open source hardware, allowing indoor localization and fall detection. The bed monitoring system is made up of aluminum sheets sensor electrodes installed under the bed sheets to detect the sleeping patterns of the subject. An alarm system has been integrated into the room to enable the elderly to call for help during an emergency. Presence detector and light controlling device are installed on the floor surface to detect the mobility of the elderly and turn ON/OFF the room lights automatically. The proposed system allows elderly people to live independent living at homes with all amenities.

AB In this paper, the subject of embedded systems education in the Arduino age is examined. Arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform that has been widely popular in the past decade among hobbyists and academics. Arduino is increasingly being adopted in courses that span different disciplines in schools and universities. As a result, numerous papers are being published every year in different engineering education conferences and journals reporting the integration of Arduino in teaching. In this work, the impact of Arduino on embedded systems education is investigated. First, challenges facing embedded systems education are identified from the literature. Second, different Arduino teaching integration methodologies reported in the literature are surveyed and analyzed. Third, the question whether Arduino successfully addresses embedded education challenges or not is discussed taking both surveyed findings and recent market trends into consideration. Finally, a number of openended research directions are proposed.

AB Microprocessor (uP) Architecture and Programming constitute core courses in computer science and electronic engineering departments. A variety of tools has been used for gaining more knowledge and understanding the basic and advanced concepts of the course. These tools (hardware platforms and simulators) are focused mainly on assembly programming. Despite the existing tools, students still face great learning difficulties. On the other hand, key issues are the corresponding architecture and the programming features of the uP under studying. The above issues are not fully addressed by the existing tools. In this paper, a customizable hardware based uP simulator is presented and final proposed. Using this simulator, an experimental hypothetical educational uP can be built by students and the professors can create the corresponding learning scenarios. Based on the proposed approach, the experimental uP consists of identical hardware based blocks that can be reprogrammed for representing registers, arithmetic and logic unit, etc. Thus, the students can act now as uP architecture and assembly language designers gaining crucial knowledge in the field.

AB In recent years, many internet of things (IoT) platforms based on cloud computing have been proposed for general purpose applications. Though many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source hardware devices.

DE Arduino due; rapid control prototyping (RCP); block libraries;
   high-speed USB interface
AB In this paper, we propose a light-weight rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on off-the-shelf open source hardware to achieve high performance computing, cost effectiveness, portability, and easy accessiblity. The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education.

AB Purpose - Smart eyewear, such as augmented or virtual reality headset, allows the projection of virtual content through a display worn on the user's head. This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named "CARTON", which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch.
   Design/methodology/approach - User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON's hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities.
   Findings - Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task.
   Originality/value - The authors describe a novel way to create a smart eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to accelerate research around it.

AB This paper elucidates the design and implementation of a low-cost wireless intelligent two hand gesture recognition system. The proposed system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328 microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency was found to be 80.06% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16% in EIM. The cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization.

AB In this paper, we study code clones in hardware description languages (HDLs) in comparison with general programming languages. For this purpose, we have developed a method for detecting code clones in Verilog HDL. A key idea of the proposed method is to convert the Verilog HDL code into the pseudo C++ code, which is then processed by an existing code clone detector for C++. We conducted an experiment on 10 open source hardware products described in Verilog HDL, where we succeeded in detecting nearly 1,800 clone sets with approximately 80% precision. We compared code clones in Verilog HDL with those in Java/C based on the metrics to identify the differences among languages. We identified patterns on how code clones are created in Verilog HDL, which include cases for increasing stability and capability of parallel processing of the circuit.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a solution for the levelling plate of fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) systems. This automatic levelling system is presented as an evolution of actual systems, which uses a new ultrasound sensing system.
   Design/methodology/approach - After obtaining a prototype, different tests were conducted for getting a system which solves the level plate problem and can be mounted in any FDM AM machine. Several benchmark models were obtained and compared with current equipment concepts for the validity of the product.
   Findings - All tests were performed with high accuracy, enabling the production of geometries that could not have been achieved without this novel system.
   Practical implications - This development will enable experienced users to set aside the problems of calibration and focus on the purpose of this type of machines, making prototypes.
   Originality/value - A system architecture has been developed and integrated into an open hardware AM system, allowing real-time adjustment of the plate during each layer, thus eliminating the need of levelling the plate, allowing to achieve easier printing, and without increasing the cost significantly.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop a low cost open source Controller Area Network system that simulates electronic controls in modern automotive vehicles and to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching aid. The Arduino UNO microcontroller hoard was chosen as the desired hardware platform and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the Arduino compiler was chosen as the software development environment. Both the Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE/compiler are open source and freely available to students and staff with no proprietary intellectual property costs.
   The Arduino UNO was interfaced with the Arduino Controller Area Network Bus (CANBus) shield which is also open hardware. Unitec Institute of Technology practices a holistic approach to teaching. As part of its holistic approach to teaching, senior students are encouraged to develop technical artefacts that can be used as teaching aids for junior students, the junior students are introduced to the artefact as part of their course and the artefact is used to encourage junior students to increase their technical proficiency so that when they reach a senior technical level they can develop artefacts too. The holistic approach is considered to he self-sustaining and provides positive role modelling for junior students. The project described in this paper was developed by a senior student and has been used as a teaching aid for junior students congruent with the holistic teaching philosophy practiced at Unitec. The code and circuitry was designed by an exchange Masters student and was used in the papers, APTE 7504 Vehicle Electronic Diagnostics and APTE 6505 Automotive Electronics, to help students understand CANBus operation and design features in an Automotive CANBus application.

AB A low-cost, low power consumption indoor environment monitoring instrument, called SKOMOBO (school monitoring box), was developed and tested. SKOMOBO includes sensors to monitor temperature/relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter and motions. SKOMOBO was developed using the open source hardware Arduino Pro Mini. This paper describes the process of building SKOMOBO, including sensor selection, printed circuit board design, sensor programming and performance evaluation. Two co-located tests have been undertaken; one in the controlled environment and one in the uncontrolled environment. Results show SKOMOBO measurements have high correlations with their commercial equivalents. In the two different testing environments, the R-2 of temperature measurements for all six SKOMOBOs were 1. The R-2 for relative humidity and CO2 measurements were above 0.9. The result of this work shows the reliability of SKOMOBO on monitoring indoor air quality.

AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are increasingly becoming integral parts of many non-electrical fields of engineering, e.g., Precision Agriculture, Avionics, Bionics, Civionics, and so on. Modern mechanical engineering is nearly synonymous with Mechatronics, and more recently Mechaphonics, viz., study of mechanical systems controlled by mobile phone apps, has become popular. Pneumatics, or compressed air, and hydraulics are niche areas of mechanical engineering with many industrial and other applications, and their performance is enhanced by incorporating electronic hardware and computer software. Many of these systems are also good examples of so-called smart products and Internet of Things. In this paper, an affordable build-your-own (BYO) computer control system is designed and developed for hands-on instruction in electro-pneumatics education. Results of implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system using low-cost components, open source hardware and free open source software, are presented to illustrate the practical utility of the proposed system.

ID IMPACT
AB Prosopis juliflora is a small weed tree, native to Central and South America, and the Caribbean, which has become a major invasive weed in Asia, including India, Latin America, Africa and Australia. It has major detrimental impact on scarce, underground water resources, takes over the local flora ecosystems and affects the soil environment. Manual removal of saplings is time-consuming and expensive. Presently, the removal of the weed is performed manually which is time-consuming, or using very expensive commercial heavy equipment. In this paper, an affordable and innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system is designed and developed for autonomous identification and removal of the weed seedlings and saplings. Results of implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system using mainly commercial off-the-shelf components, open source hardware and free open source software, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This paper presents a solution for different activities concerning shrimp farming, especially focused on the middle-class artisanal productive sector, using both open source hardware and open source software. The proposal aims to optimize monitoring during shrimp farming, measuring parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature and food levels inside reservoirs, in order to have a real-time reading of parameters. In case critical values appear, an alarm activates by control center, notifying by either electronic mail or web interface. The attractiveness of the proposal consists in the automation of the feeding system, which provides food supply to shrimps at certain daily periods, controlling by web interface the different options the breeder has available, a process that can be even managed remotely.

AB This paper presents a case study on emerging challenges within collaborative innovation projects engaging open communities. Innovation driven by open communities has proven to have a significant potential, in particular for open source software. However, tools and methodologies enabling the supervision of collaborative innovation involving open communities, in the perspective of creating open hardware to solve societal issues, remains at the early stages. This paper seeks to pinpoint the potentialities and challenges of such projects toward defining methods to better support a multi-stakeholders open source collaboration context. The experimental field of this research concerns the smart electricity distribution, and more precisely a public driven project of the diffusion of smart-meters in France and their appropriation by open source communities, with the involvement of the university and a public industrial company. The project seeks to study how these communities of users develop in a collaborative manner, new products and services using the smart-meter as a support technology. The first results show that the open community makes natural connection on specific environments such as Smart buildings to materialize usages of smart meters.

AB The use of open hardware for non-programmers in higher education is an added value for the achievement of projects by students of arts and design. On the one hand we are using what the community has to offer and on the other we are enabling students to use open technologies, so that they can use them with respect to their licenses.
   These technologies, often presented as difficult to use, with long learning curves, compared to other programs whose students and some teachers are more accustomed to use, have a greater value if they can be used freely and in any type of project. Whether in an academic setting or in the final product environment for a particular client.
   It is important to de-emphasize their use with the students and to show that they can be used in the classroom in a creative way or to carry out other types of projects.

AB This paper introduces a low-cost AC meter designed to continuously measure voltage and current waveforms at up to 14 kHz. The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3(2), making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depending on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases.

AB Active chlorophyll a fluorescence is an essential tool for understanding photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses. Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research.

AB Traditionally unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) have been large, complex and expensive. Development of UUVs has been driven by defense and commercial requirements. This has allowed for extensive research and development budgets and long development cycles. This paper briefly discuses these historic drivers and how this situation has changed. It focuses on a new compact affordable UUV.
   In 2015, several veterans of the conventional UUV sector set out to change the dynamics of the industry, founding Riptide Autonomous Solutions. Riptide's first offering was the micro-UUV, a new, highly flexible, open source autonomous undersea vehicle. The micro-UUV features open hardware and software interfaces giving users a reliable and robust platform to advance technology development. The vehicle design is optimized for high efficiency with the best hydrodynamic signature in its class. The base micro-UUV is 4 7/8 inches in diameter, 40 inches in length and weighs 22 lbs. The standard system is rated to a depth of 300 meters.
   This paper discuses the technical details of this UUV that make it distinctive and enabled its rapid development. The entire system was taken from design to initial delivery in under 12 months. Flexible and open software interfaces and use of modern three dimensional design and printing are key enablers of the rapid development. A highly optimized hydrodynamic design improves the speed and endurance of the vehicle, as does its compact size. Reducing control fins from the typical four to three reduces drag and enables active roll control steering, a further enhancement of the micro-UUV's performance. In addition to describing the novel features and approach of the micro-UUV design this paper will discuss the potential for a new aluminum seawater battery to extend the range of this compact vehicle to nearly 1000km.
