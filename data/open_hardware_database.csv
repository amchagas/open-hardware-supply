This paper analyzes the development background and research status of energy Internet of things technology at home and abroad and determines the overall design scheme of environmental monitoring Internet of things system.

Therefore, the reliance on smart commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) implantable wireless medical devices (IWMDs) is increasing among healthcare institutions to provide routine medical services, such as monitoring patients’ physiological signals and the remote delivery of therapeutic drugs. These smart COTS IWMDs reduce the necessity of recurring visits of patients to healthcare institutions and also mitigate physical contact, which can minimize the possibility of any potential spread of contagious diseases. Furthermore, the devices provide patients with the benefit of recuperating in familiar surroundings. As such, low-cost, ubiquitous COTS IWMDs have engendered the proliferation of telemedicine in healthcare to provide routine medical services. In this paper, a review work on COTS IWMDs is presented at a macro level to discuss the history of IWMDs, different networked COTS IWMDs, health and safety regulations of COTS IWMDs and the importance of organized procurement.

Advanced supercomputing is characterized by very high computation speeds at the cost of involving an enormous amount of resources and costs. A typical large-scale computation running for 48 h on a system consuming 20 MW, as predicted for exascale systems, would consume a million kWh, corresponding to about 100k Euro in energy cost for executing 10                23                floating-point operations. It is clearly unacceptable to lose the whole computation if any of the several million parallel processes fails during the execution. Moreover, if a single operation suffers from a bit-flip error, should the whole computation be declared invalid? What about the notion of reproducibility itself: should this core paradigm of science be revised and refined for results that are obtained by large-scale simulation? Naive versions of conventional resilience techniques will not scale to the exascale regime: with a main memory footprint of tens of Petabytes, synchronously writing checkpoint data all the way to background storage at frequent intervals will create intolerable overheads in runtime and energy consumption. Forecasts show that the mean time between failures could be lower than the time to recover from such a checkpoint, so that large calculations at scale might not make any progress if robust alternatives are not investigated. More advanced resilience techniques must be devised. The key may lie in exploiting both advanced system features as well as specific application knowledge. Research will face two essential questions: (1) what are the reliability requirements for a particular computation and (2) how do we best design the algorithms and software to meet these requirements? While the analysis of use cases can help understand the particular reliability requirements, the construction of remedies is currently wide open. One avenue would be to refine and improve on system- or application-level checkpointing and rollback strategies in the case an error is detected. Developers might use fault notification interfaces and flexible runtime systems to respond to node failures in an application-dependent fashion. Novel numerical algorithms or more stochastic computational approaches may be required to meet accuracy requirements in the face of undetectable soft errors. These ideas constituted an essential topic of the seminar. The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together a diverse group of scientists with expertise in exascale computing to discuss novel ways to make applications resilient against detected and undetected faults. In particular, participants explored the role that algorithms and applications play in the holistic approach needed to tackle this challenge. This article gathers a broad range of perspectives on the role of algorithms, applications and systems in achieving resilience for extreme scale simulations. The ultimate goal is to spark novel ideas and encourage the development of concrete solutions for achieving such resilience holistically.","2022-03","2023-02-15 00:12:44","2023-02-15 00:12:44","2023-02-15 00:12:43","251-285","","2","36","","The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","green","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to their attachment to the Internet, SCADA systems are, today, vulnerable to attacks such as, among several others, interception of data traffic, malicious modifications of settings and control operations data, malicious modification of measurements and infrastructure data and Denial-of-Service attacks. Our research focuses on strengthening SCADA systems with cryptographic methods and protection mechanisms with emphasis on data and messaging encryption and device identification and authentication. The limited availability of computing power and memory in sensors and embedded devices deployed in SCADA systems make render cryptographic methods with higher resource requirements, such as the use of conventional public key cryptography such as RSA, unsuitable. We, thus, propose Elliptic Curve Cryptography as an alternative cryptographic mechanism, where smaller key sizes are required, with lower resource requirements for cryptographic operations. Accordingly, our approach integrates Modbus, a commonly used SCADA communication protocol, with Elliptic Curve Cryptography. We have, also, developed an experimental set-up in order to demonstrate the performance of our approach and draw conclusions regarding its effectiveness in real SCADA installations.","2022-07-28","2023-02-15 00:12:29","2023-02-15 00:12:29","2023-02-15 00:12:28","232","","8","14","","Future Internet","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How to stabilize one if it were to hover like a small insect has not been answered. Challenges include the requirement that sensors be both low mass and high bandwidth and that silicon-micromachined rate gyroscopes are too heavy. The smallest robot to perform controlled hovering uses a sensor suite weighing hundreds of milligrams. Here, we demonstrate that an accelerometer represents perhaps the most direct way to stabilize flight while satisfying the extreme size, speed, weight, and power constraints of a flying robot even as it scales down to just a few milligrams. As aircraft scale reduces, scaling physics dictates that the ratio of aerodynamic drag to mass increases. This results in reduced noise in an accelerometer’s airspeed measurement. We show through simulation and experiment on a 30-gram robot that a 2-milligram off-the-shelf accelerometer is able in principle to stabilize a 10-milligram robot despite high noise in the sensor itself. Inspired by wind-vision sensory fusion in the flight controller of the fruit fly                Drosophila melanogaster                , we then added a tiny camera and efficient, fly-inspired autocorrelation-based visual processing to allow the robot to estimate and reject wind as well as control its attitude and flight velocity using a Kalman filter.

The assigned CH is the next node with the highest energy level known as the backup node. This cluster supervisor (CS) is supported by the cluster head (CH) and other backup nodes in the network.

We present a complete platform by which patterns of electricity can be arbitrarily defined and distributed across a brain circuit, either simultaneously, asynchronously, or in complex patterns that can be easily designed and orchestrated with precise timing. Interfacing with acute slices of mouse cortex, we show that our system can be used to activate neurons at many locations and drive synaptic transmission in distributed patterns, and that this elicits new forms of plasticity that may not be observable via traditional methods, including interesting measurements of associational and sequence plasticity. Finally, we introduce an automated “network assay” for imaging activation and plasticity across a circuit.

The cell, in turn, interprets these signals and accordingly initiates downstream processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and self-organization. Conventional approaches to perturb and investigate signaling pathways (e.g., agonist/antagonist addition, overexpression, silencing, knockouts) are often binary perturbations that do not offer precise control over signaling levels, and/or provide limited spatial or temporal control. In contrast, optogenetics leverages light-sensitive proteins to control cellular signaling dynamics and target gene expression and, by virtue of precise hardware control over illumination, offers the capacity to interrogate how spatiotemporally varying signals modulate gene regulatory networks and cellular behaviors. Recent studies have employed various optogenetic systems in stem cell, embryonic, and somatic cell patterning studies, which have addressed fundamental questions of how cell-cell communication, subcellular protein localization, and signal integration affect cell fate. Other efforts have explored how alteration of signaling dynamics may contribute to neurological diseases and have in the process created physiologically relevant models that could inform new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we focus on emerging applications within the expanding field of optogenetics to study gene regulation, cell signaling, neurodevelopment, and neurological disorders, and we comment on current limitations and future directions for the growth of the field.","2022-02-22","2023-02-15 00:11:56","2023-02-15 00:11:56","2023-02-15 00:11:56","811493","","","16","","Front.

In such unstructured, poorly lit, complex, and remote environments, automation is not always possible, and some tasks, such as geological sampling, require direct teleoperation aided by force-feedback (FF). The operator would be on an orbiting spacecraft, and poor bandwidth, high latency, and packet loss from orbit to ground mean that safe, stable, and transparent interaction is a substantial technical challenge. For this scenario, a control method was developed that ensures stability at high delay without reduction in speed or loss of positioning accuracy. At the same time, a new level of safety is achieved not only through FF itself but also through an intrinsic property of the approach preventing hard impacts. On the basis of this method, a tele-exploration scenario was simulated in the Analog-1 experiment with an astronaut on the International Space Station (ISS) using a 6–degree-of-freedom (DoF) FF capable haptic input device to control a mobile robot with manipulator on Earth to collect rock samples. The 6-DoF FF telemanipulation from space was performed at a round-trip communication delay constantly between 770 and 850 milliseconds and an average packet loss of 1.27%. This experiment showcases the feasibility of a complete space exploration scenario via haptic telemanipulation under spaceflight conditions. The results underline the benefits of this control method for safe and accurate interactions and of haptic feedback in general.            ,               A robotic manipulator was safely, stably, and transparently full-DoF teleoperated from orbit to ground, with force-feedback.","2022-04-20","2023-02-15 00:11:47","2023-02-15 00:11:47","2023-02-15 00:11:47","eabl6307","","65","7","","Sci.

This study investigated the performance of a dense optical flow algorithm on 14 bit radiometric images of the ground. While sparse techniques that rely on feature matching techniques perform very well with airborne thermal data in high-contrast thermal conditions, these techniques suffer in low-contrast scenes, where there are fewer detectable and distinct features in the image. On the other hand, some dense optical flow algorithms are highly amenable to parallel processing approaches compared to those that rely on tracking and feature detection. A Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) micro-sensor and a PX4Flow optical sensor were mounted looking downwards on a drone. We compared the optical flow signals of a representative dense optical flow technique, the Image Interpolation Algorithm (I2A), to the Lucas–Kanade (LK) algorithm in OpenCV and the visible light optical flow results from the PX4Flow in both X and Y displacements.

In this article, a method has been introduced for the measurement of the grid frequency through a power line harmonics radiation analysis. An extremely low-frequency magnetometer was developed with the specific purpose of monitoring, in real time, the electromagnetic field produced by electrical installations in the range from 0 to 2.2 kHz. Zero-crossing and Fast Fourier transform algorithms were applied to the output signal to calculate the grid frequency as a non-invasive method. As a final step, data for a complete month (May 2021) were compared with a commercial power quality analyzer connected to the main line to validate the results. The zero-crossing algorithm gave the best result on 3 May 2021, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9801.

This study analyzes the economic impacts of a theoretical international agreement that eliminates patent rights for any nuclear aggressor (i.e., free global compulsory licensing of all intellectual property (IP) for a nuclear aggressor). The results found that all but one of the nuclear states would have a significant economic disincentive to start a nuclear attack if the proposal was put into force. Payback times ranged from 1.2 to 40 years, where the entire GDP of a nuclear aggressor would be needed to offset the loss for aggression, indicate such a mechanism as a whole would be an effective nuclear deterrent. This method would not be universally effective without ensuring all nuclear states are members of the international economy and IP processes. With the growth of open-source products and reduced value of patents, this mechanism does have a limited effectiveness time.

Although spirits such as openness and sharing in the slogan successfully directed the attention of the government, the capital, and the general public to individual innovation, they might be unilaterally presented. Drawing upon Michel Foucault’s conceptualization of heterotopias, this article explores the features of makerspaces in Shenzhen, China, arguing that the heterogeneous culture generated by makerspaces played an essential role in stimulating innovation and expanding the impact of maker movement. This article presents four types of heterogeneous culture, the cultures of tolerance, liminality, compensation, and confrontation, which enriched the research on makerspaces and enhanced the status of makerspaces in innovation studies. Through the critical lens, this article shows the social and cultural meanings of makerspaces to makers, makerspace operators, and governments, calling for their rethinking in sustainable development of makerspaces.","2022-12-30","2023-02-15 00:11:09","2023-02-15 00:11:09","2023-02-15 00:11:09","629","","1","15","","Sustainability","The Power of Makerspaces","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: Perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, using exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. In addition, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here, we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end to end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers.            ,               A legged locomotion controller achieves high robustness and speed in the wild by combining multimodal information.","2022-01-19","2023-02-15 00:11:06","2023-02-15 00:11:06","2023-02-15 00:11:05","eabk2822","","62","7","","Sci.

Although some other studies have incorporated ML techniques to predict and control petroleum product terminals in terms of concentration, the proposed framework incorporates Add On Instruction (AOI) programming, PLC, and ML methods to automatically monitor petroleum products terminals. The framework adds an AOI in programming to achieve maximum usage of processor capabilities. Moreover, it uses AOI for programming in cooperation with the ladder diagram (LD). This leads to simplifying the LD graphical programming language, reducing the time of scanning, and making facilitate troubleshooting. The AOI is merged with ML to automate tank level detection and maintain good operational conditions and consequently protect these expensive essential assets. The introduced framework consists of three stages. The first stage is the PLC programming phase where the PLC is created using Add-On instructions. Next, HMI graphic displays are drawn and linked to the PLC tags in the following stage. During the third stage, the actual process readings are applied to the system based on ML algorithms to test its functionality. The proposed system results indicates a reduction in the LD number, highest program size, and maximum time of scanning. The results indicate that the AOI can help to trace the program more easily in fault situations. Besides, additional program instructions could reduce processor memory, system construction costs, and upgrade projects.","2022-07","2023-02-15 00:11:03","2023-02-15 00:11:03","2023-02-15 00:11:03","830-848","","7-8","55","","Measurement and Control","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These institutes provide calibration services, which links the measurement units to industrial and everyday measurements. This traceability is critical to overcome technical barriers to trade and industrialisation. Most African countries have such a designated institute that requires advanced scientific instrumentation. These instruments are custom-built for a specific application, hard to procure or sometimes obsolete. Servicing these instruments or obtaining spare parts are also difficult. The purpose aims to evaluate if three-dimensional (3D) printing can significantly improve this situation, by providing six institutes with a 3D printer and training.                                            Design/methodology/approach                Therefore, a 3D printer pilot project was launched, involving six African metrology institutes, with the aim of developing the basic manufacturing capabilities of these institutes so that they can produce functional parts. The project included training on both digital part modelling and 3D printer usage. This case study reviews the technology selection method, project risks, needs, challenges and results, with the aid of research questions.

This predictive volume estimation framework incorporates a self-correction mechanism that can minimize the error after each bottle fill-up cycle, which makes the system robust to errors from the sip classification module. In this paper, a detailed characterization of sip detection is performed to understand the accuracy-complexity tradeoffs by developing and implementing a variety of different ML models with varying complexities.

However, it is difficult to implement an image processing algorithm that requires a lot of calculations on a light board. This paper proposes a method using real-time deep learning object recognition algorithms in lightweight embedded boards. We have developed an algorithm suitable for lightweight embedded boards by appropriately using two deep neural network architectures. The first architecture requires small computational volumes, although it provides low accuracy. The second architecture uses large computational volumes and provides high accuracy. The area is determined using the first architecture, which processes semantic segmentation with relatively little computation. After masking the area using the more accurate deep learning architecture, object detection is implemented with improved accuracy, as the image is filtered by segmentation and the cases that have not been recognized by various variables, such as differentiation from the background, are excluded. OpenCV (Open source Computer Vision) is used to process input images in Python, and images are processed using an efficient neural network (ENet) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). By running this algorithm, the average error can be reduced by approximately 2.4 times, allowing for more accurate object detection. In addition, object recognition can be performed in real time for lightweight embedded boards, as a rate of about 4 FPS (frames per second) is achieved.","2022-11-17","2023-02-15 00:10:24","2023-02-15 00:10:24","2023-02-15 00:10:23","8890","","22","22","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fully exploit the merits of data reuse, this study proposes a rearrangement of the computational sequence in a deep learning accelerator. Once input data are read from the global buffer, repeatedly reading the same data is performed only through the local register file, saving significant power consumption. Furthermore, different from prior works that equip local register files in each computation unit, the proposed method enables sharing a local register file along the column of the 2D computation array, saving resources and controlling overhead. The proposed accelerator is implemented on an off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array to verify the functionality and resource utilization. Then, the performance improvement of the proposed method is demonstrated relative to popular deep learning accelerators. Our evaluation indicates that the proposed deep learning accelerator reduces the number of global-buffer accesses to nearly 86.8%, consequently saving up to 72.3% of the power consumption for the input data memory access with a minor increase in resource usage compared to a conventional deep learning accelerator.","2022-04-18","2023-02-15 00:10:21","2023-02-15 00:10:21","2023-02-15 00:10:20","3095","","8","22","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is challenging for conventional computing hardware. Parallel processor arrays (PPAs) are a new class of vision sensor devices that exploit advances in semiconductor technology, embedding a processor within each pixel of the image sensor array. Sensed pixel data are processed on the focal plane, and only a small amount of relevant information is transmitted out of the vision sensor. This tight integration of sensing, processing, and memory within a massively parallel computing architecture leads to an interesting trade-off between high performance, low latency, low power, low cost, and versatility in a machine vision system. Here, we review the history of image sensing and processing hardware from the perspective of in-pixel computing and outline the key features of a state-of-the-art smart camera system based on a PPA device, through the description of the SCAMP-5 system. We describe several robotic applications for agile ground and aerial vehicles, demonstrating PPA sensing functionalities including high-speed odometry, target tracking, obstacle detection, and avoidance.

Although it has been a common occupation for the urban population all along, recently there is a growing interest in it both from public bodies and researchers, as well as from ordinary citizens who want to engage in self-cultivation. The modern citizen, though, will hardly find the free time to grow his own vegetables as it is a process that requires, in addition to knowledge and disposition, consistency. Given the above considerations, the purpose of this work was to develop an economic robotic system for the automatic monitoring and management of an urban garden. The robotic system was designed and built entirely from scratch. It had to have suitable dimensions so that it could be placed in a balcony or a terrace, and be able to scout vegetables from planting to harvest and primarily conduct precision irrigation based on the growth stage of each plant. Fertigation and weed control will also follow. For its development, a number of technologies were combined, such as Cartesian robots’ motion, machine vision, deep learning for the identification and detection of plants, irrigation dosage and scheduling based on plants’ growth stage, and cloud storage. The complete process of software and hardware development to a robust robotic platform is described in detail in the respective sections.

It is especially desirable to solve the electronic structure problem, a central problem in chemistry and materials science, efficiently and accurately with well-designed quantum algorithms. Various quantum electronic-structure algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this article, we briefly review recent progress in this direction with a special emphasis on the basis sets and boundary conditions. Compared to classical electronic structure calculations, there are new considerations in choosing a basis set in quantum algorithms. For example, the effect of the basis set on the circuit complexity is very important in quantum algorithm design. Electronic structure calculations should be performed with an appropriate boundary condition. Simply using a wave function ansatz designed for molecular systems in a material system with a periodic boundary condition may lead to significant errors. Artificial boundary conditions can be used to partition a large system into smaller fragments to save quantum resources. The basis sets and boundary conditions are expected to play a crucial role in electronic structure calculations on future quantum computers, especially for realistic systems.","2022","2023-02-15 00:09:59","2023-02-15 00:09:59","2023-02-15 00:09:59","3263-3279","","8","51","","Chem.

Energy consumption reduction and energy efficiency appear to be the two paths to addressing this target. To achieve this goal, many different techniques are promoted, among them, the integration of (artificial) intelligence in the energy workflow is gaining importance. All these approaches have a common need: data. Data that should be collected and provided in a reliable, accurate, secure, and efficient way. For this purpose, sensing technologies that enable ubiquitous data acquisition and the new communication infrastructure that ensure low latency and high density are the key. This article presents a sensing solution devoted to the precise gathering of energy parameters such as voltage, current, active power, and power factor for server farms and datacenters, computing infrastructures that are growing meaningfully to meet the demand for network applications. The designed system enables disaggregated acquisition of energy data from a large number of devices and characterization of their consumption behavior, both in real time. In this work, the creation of a complete multiport power meter system is detailed. The study reports all the steps needed to create the prototype, from the analysis of electronic components, the selection of sensors, the design of the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), the configuration and calibration of the hardware and embedded system, and the implementation of the software layer. The power meter application is geared toward data centers and server farms and has been tested by connecting it to a laboratory server rack, although its designs can be easily adapted to other scenarios where gathering the energy consumption information was needed. The novelty of the system is based on high scalability built upon two factors. Firstly, the one-on-one approach followed to acquire the data from each power source, even if they belong to the same physical equipment, so the system can correlate extremely well the execution of processes with the energy data. Thus, the potential of data to develop tailored solutions rises. Second, the use of temporal multiplexing to keep the real-time data delivery even for a very high number of sources. All these ensure compatibility with standard IoT networks and applications, as the data markup language is used (enabling database storage and computing system processing) and the interconnection is done by well-known protocols.","2022-12-23","2023-02-15 00:09:29","2023-02-15 00:09:29","2023-02-15 00:09:28","119","","1","23","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This technique makes use of power consumption generators as basic modules, which are usually based on ring oscillators when implemented on FPGAs. These modules can be used to generate power noise and to also extract digital signatures through the power side channel for Intellectual Property (IP) protection purposes. In this paper, a new power consumption generator, named Xored High Consuming Module (XHCM), is proposed. XHCM improves, when compared to others proposals in the literature, the amount of current consumption per LUT when implemented on FPGAs. Experimental results show that these modules can achieve current increments in the range from 2.4 mA (with only 16 LUTs on Artix-7 devices with a power consumption density of 0.75 mW/LUT when using a single HCM) to 11.1 mA (with 67 LUTs when using 8 XHCMs, with a power consumption density of 0.83 mW/LUT). Moreover, a version controlled by Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) has been developed, named PWM-XHCM, which is, as XHCM, suitable for power watermarking. In order to build countermeasures against SPA attacks, a multi-level XHCM (ML-XHCM) is also presented, which is capable of generating different power consumption levels with minimal area overhead (27 six-input LUTS for generating 16 different amplitude levels on Artix-7 devices). Finally, a randomized version, named RML-XHCM, has also been developed using two True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) to generate current consumption peaks with random amplitudes at random times. RML-XHCM requires less than 150 LUTs on Artix-7 devices. Taking into account these characteristics, two main contributions have been carried out in this article: first, XHCM and PWM-XHCM provide an efficient power consumption generator for extracting digital signatures through the power side channel, and on the other hand, ML-XHCM and RML-XHCM are powerful tools for the protection of processing units against SPA attacks in IoT devices implemented on FPGAs.","2022-09-10","2023-02-15 00:09:19","2023-02-15 00:09:19","2023-02-15 00:09:18","48","","3","12","","JLPEA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fit performance was measured by a quantitative fit test (QNFT) device (PortaCount, model 8048, TSI Incorporated, Minnesota, USA) accepted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The PortaCount device, which is based on a miniature continuous flow condensation nucleus counter (CNC), assesses the respiratory fit by comparing the concentration of ambient dust particles outside the surgical mask to the concentration that has leaked into the surgical mask. The ratio of these two concentrations (Cout/Cin) is called the fit factor. A fit factor of a 3D printed frame of at least 100 is required and considered as a pass level. Results. We found that the mask fitter improves the overall performance of surgical masks significantly. The improved performance is comparable to that of N95. Conclusion. The mask fitter improves the performance of surgical masks. The authors suggested that further study on frame material, shape, and expanded sample size would be beneficial to society.","2022-03-16","2023-02-15 00:09:09","2023-02-15 00:09:09","2023-02-15 00:09:09","1-6","","","2022","","International Journal of Dentistry","Quantitative Fit Test of a 3D Printed Frame Fitted Over a Surgical Mask","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","Pucci, Cesar Rogério","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A deep neural network can detect the deeper-level features with a multilayer through nonlinear mapping. However, there are few viable deep learning algorithms applied to BCI systems. This study proposes a more effective acquisition and processing HW-SW method for EEG biosignal. First, we use a consumer-grade EEG acquisition device to record EEG signals. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) methods will be used for data preprocessing. Compared with other algorithms, the CWT-CNN algorithm shows a better classification accuracy. The research result shows that the best classification accuracy of the CWT-CNN algorithm is 91.65%. On the other side, CNN inference requires many convolution operations. We further propose a lightweight CNN inference hardware accelerator framework to speed up inference calculation, and we verify and evaluate its performance.

In general, this classification is addressed using expert judgment and a combination of tools. However, the growth of integrated circuit complexity creates a huge fault space; hence, this form of fault classification is error prone and time consuming. Therefore, an automated and systematic approach is needed to target hardware fault classification in automotive systems on chips (SoCs), considering the application software. This work focuses on identifying safe faults: the proposed approach utilizes coverage analysis to identify candidate safe faults considering all the constraints coming from the application. Then, the behavior of the application software is modeled so that we can resort to a formal analysis tool. The proposed technique is evaluated on the AutoSoC benchmark running a cruise control application. Resorting to our approach, we could classify 20%, 11%, and 13% of all faults in the central processing unit (CPU), universal asynchronous receiver–transmitter (UART), and controller area network (CAN) as safe faults, respectively. We also show that this classification can increase the diagnostic coverage of software test libraries targeting the CPU and CAN modules by 4% to 6%, increasing the achieved testable fault coverage.","2022-01-20","2023-02-15 00:08:52","2023-02-15 00:08:52","2023-02-15 00:08:52","319","","3","11","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Battery storage was also managed by the home automation module using a set of sensors. The prototype of the scale model incorporated complete energy management of all electrical devices with group priorities through a graphical interface in a real-time mode. After testing this system, the lighting management part was implemented in a large-scale smart solar home. A smart lighting system via a complete algorithm integrated on an Arduino Mega board was then realized and implemented in the life-size house. This first step focuses, above all, on the users’ comfort and, in particular, on the lighting management.

These individual drone systems interact only with their own components without any integrated management. As the number of UASs is increasing due to the expansion of the drone industry, standardized operation is required. Therefore, to integrate and manage existing drone systems, the Federal Aviation Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration devised UAS Traffic Management (UTM). The drone identity module (DIM), which is being developed as a drone identification device, securely stores the remote identification (RID) of each drone and performs a cryptographic operation to secure information between the drone and UTM infrastructure. The DIM performs cryptographic authentication protocols to achieve cryptographic identification and authentication with the UTM infrastructure, which requires random numbers. Modern cryptographic systems rely on difficult computations, and an environment capable of generating secure cryptographic random numbers must be configured to provide high computational costs to attackers. In this paper, we explain the need for random numbers in the DIM, analyze random number generators used in related drone-based studies, and analyze the characteristics of noise resource generation devices that can be used in existing drone systems. Subsequently, based on the analysis results, existing methods are used to generate random numbers in the DIM, and limitations are derived. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method of generating random numbers in the DIM using quantum noise resources. For our proposal, we conduct an analysis of the physical specifications of noise resource generation devices, DIM prototypes, and quantum noise resource generators in existing drone systems, and we present the results of NIST 800-90B entropy measurement using data collected from quantum random number generators.","2022-11-09","2023-02-15 00:08:40","2023-02-15 00:08:40","2023-02-15 00:08:40","1-12","","","2022","","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","Huo, Yan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these studies have been conducted under ideal conditions, such as wind tunnels and computational environments, and limited studies have investigated the effects of plasma actuators in an actual environment. In this study, the flow control capability of a DBD-PA under natural and in-flight conditions was investigated via field flight tests using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The DBD-PA driving system was constructed with a small high-voltage power supply on a 2-m-span UAV. With the support of an autonomous flight system, the pitch angle gradually increased as the airspeed decreased, and the stall occurred from the cruise state. This flight procedure was conducted with the DBD-PA on or off, and 246 pairs of flights were operated. The results revealed that a flight state with a higher pitch angle and lower airspeed occurred when DBD-PA was switched on. In addition, the moment of stall was quantitatively determined from the flight log, and it was confirmed that the maximum pitch angle when DBD-PA was switched on tended to be larger than that when DBD-PA was switched off. These results indicate that flow control with a DBD-PA on a 2-m-span UAV was effective in natural and in-flight situations.","2022-03-07","2023-02-15 00:08:31","2023-02-15 00:08:31","2023-02-15 00:08:31","144","","3","9","","Aerospace","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result of this need, PV power converters were proposed, as they are both economically competitive and commercially available. The use of PV power converters for SWT AC-coupled applications is therefore analyzed as well, bringing a second conclusion: their use is possible but not straightforward, as some adaptations have to be taken into account.

Improving genetic resources, and therefore resistant cultivars, is an ongoing focus of many pest management strategies. One of the major bottlenecks in identifying the plant genes that impact the infection, and thus the yield, is phenotyping. The current available screening method is slow, has unidimensional quantification of infection limiting the range of scorable parameters, and does not account for phenotypic variation of the host. The ever-evolving field of computer vision may be the solution for both the above-mentioned issues. To utilise these tools, a specialised imaging platform is required to take consistent images of nematode infection in quick succession.

A cost-effective, easy-to-build and -use, 3D-printed imaging device was developed to acquire images of the root system of                  Arabidopsis thaliana                  infected with the cyst nematode                  Heterodera schachtii                  , replacing costly microscopy equipment. Coupling the output of this device to simple analysis scripts allowed the measurement of some key traits such as nematode number and size from collected images, in a semi-automated manner. Additionally, we used this combined solution to quantify an additional trait, root area before infection, and showed both the confounding relationship of this trait on nematode infection and a method to account for it.

The recent hack of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement's Restoring Family Links network tools, potentially exposing the personal data of half a million vulnerable individuals to unauthorized access by unknown hackers, is a stark reminder that this is not just a theoretical risk but a very real one.                1                            The 2020 cyber operation affecting SolarWinds, a major US information technology company, demonstrated the chaos that a hack can cause by targeting digital supply chain components.

In this article I suggest the work of Lewis Mumford offers a useful lens for thinking about the political economy of technological change in an information society. I set out the role of intellectual property rights as the legal form of the global information society, and suggest a major challenge to this legal form is the idea of ‘openness’, specifically in the realm of open-source and/or free software. I examine this issue in the realm of (so-called) informational development, where major proprietary players (predominantly Microsoft) have been confronted by an increasingly vibrant open-source alternative. The open-source and free-software movements can be analysed as an emerging example of a globalised ‘double movement’, seeking to re-embed the tools of informational development in a societal realm of information, establishing in Mumford’s terms a ‘democratic technics’ as a reaction to the programme of information and knowledge commodification spurred by the TRIPs agreement.","2008-01","2023-02-14 23:18:17","2023-02-14 23:18:17","2023-02-14 23:18:16","69-92","","S1","34","","Rev.

Since fibroblasts can both synthesize and degrade ECM, ventricular fibroblasts from adult rat hearts underwent cyclical mechanical stretch (CMS; 0.33 Hz) by three different elongations (3%, 6%, 9%) and four different serum concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 5%, 10%) within 24 h. Expression of collagen I and III, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2), and colligin were analyzed by RNase protection assay. In the absence of serum, 9% CMS increased the mRNA of collagen I by 1.70-fold and collagen III by 1.64-fold. This increase was prevented by the inhibition either of PKC or of tyrosine kinase but not of PKA. Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase itself reduced the expression of collagen I and collagen III mRNA. The mRNA of MMP-2, TIMP-2, and colligin showed the same tendency by stretch. Combined with 10% serum, 6% CMS reduced the mRNA of collagen I (0.62-fold) and collagen III (0.79-fold). Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase, but not of PKA, prevented the reduction of collagen I and collagen III mRNA in 10% serum. The results show that the response of fibroblasts to CMS depends on the serum concentration. At least two signaling pathways are involved in the stretch-induced ECM regulation. Myocardial fibrosis due to ECM remodeling contributes to the dysfunction of the failing heart, which might be attributed to changes in hemodynamic loading.","2007-11","2023-02-14 23:18:09","2023-02-14 23:18:09","2023-02-14 23:18:08","R1898-R1907","","5","293","","American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach                This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process.                                            Findings                As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education.                                            Research limitations/implications                There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models.                                            Originality/value                The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature.

Drifters that track their position are important tools in studying the hydrodynamic behavior of rivers. Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to “tinkering scientists”, i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the “tinkering engineer”. We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise.","2020-11-05","2023-02-14 23:18:04","2023-02-14 23:18:04","2023-02-14 23:18:03","435-442","","2","9","","Geosci.

Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios—low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)—demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.","2018-10-25","2023-02-14 23:17:29","2023-02-14 23:17:29","2023-02-14 23:17:29","3623","","11","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This situation has produced different effects in today’s society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.","2018-12-10","2023-02-14 23:17:27","2023-02-14 23:17:27","2023-02-14 23:17:26","419","","12","7","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers’ community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far.","2019-03-26","2023-02-14 23:17:24","2023-02-14 23:17:24","2023-02-14 23:17:24","367","","3","8","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software. Although this system does not utilize expensive equipment, such as confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes, decent images can be obtained even without previous experience in electronics and optics.","2019-11-23","2023-02-14 23:17:04","2023-02-14 23:17:04","2023-02-14 23:17:03","88","","12","5","","J.

In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage.","2019-02-01","2023-02-14 23:17:01","2023-02-14 23:17:01","2023-02-14 23:17:01","627","","3","19","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include expansions from software into general culture through ‘Free Culture’ movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader ‘open’ contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to ‘open source’ the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.","2012-09","2023-02-14 23:16:26","2023-02-14 23:16:26","2023-02-14 23:16:25","691-708","","6","34","","Media, Culture & Society","Democratizing production through open source knowledge","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","green","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario.","2016","2023-02-14 23:16:11","2023-02-14 23:16:11","2023-02-14 23:16:11","1-16","","","2016","","Journal of Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\FVJIPCK6\ciabattoni_2016_an_open_and_modular_hardware_node_for_wireless_sensor_and_body_area_networks.pdf","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.","2016-11-02","2023-02-14 23:15:53","2023-02-14 23:15:53","2023-02-14 23:15:53","35363","","1","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\754DMDTH\gerhardt_2016_an_open-hardware_platform_for_optogenetics_and_photobiology.pdf","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After a discussion on the limits of current IoT and Cloud solutions in terms of secure self-configuration, we present a Cloud-based architecture that allows IoT devices to interact with several federated Cloud providers. In particular, we present two possible scenarios, that is, single Cloud and a federated Cloud environments, interacting with IoT devices and we address specific issues of both.

Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points.                                            Design/methodology/approach                – The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files.                                            Findings                – The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system.                                            Research limitations/implications                – The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects.                                            Practical implications                – The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems.                                            Social implications                – The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication.                                            Originality/value                – The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology.","2014-04-14","2023-02-14 23:15:18","2023-02-14 23:15:18","2023-02-14 23:15:17","245-255","","3","20","","","BeamMaker","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For five years, this was the most affordable method for connecting computers. The development of this technology was guided by the idea that it should be controlled by its users. With reference to this experiment, it is argued that a shared ethical and/or political vision can contribute to the establishment of norms within user communities encouraging their members to share information with each other. Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question. Particular focus is placed on the tension between, on one hand, the norms and ethical— political motives of the user community, and, on the other hand, the needs satisfied through product development, both stemming from the same innovation process.","2011-07","2023-02-14 23:15:15","2023-02-14 23:15:15","2023-02-14 23:15:14","423-450","","4","36","","Science, Technology, & Human Values","Free Space Optics in the Czech Wireless Community","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many proposals are addressing the perceived problems, ranging from new enhanced protocols to fix specific problems up to the most radical proposal to redesign and deploy a fully new Internet. Most of the problems in the current Internet are rooted in the tremendous pace of increase of its use. As a consequence there was little time to address the deficiencies of the Internet from an architectural point of view.              Within FP7, the European Commission has facilitated the creation of European expert groups around the theme FIRE ""Future Internet Research and Experimentation"". FIRE has two related dimensions: on one hand, promoting experimentally-driven long-term, visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future Internet; on the other hand, building a large-scale experimentation facility supporting both medium- and long-term research on networks and services by gradually federating existing and new testbeds for emerging or future Internet technologies. By addressing future challenges for the Internet such as mobility, scalability, security and privacy, this new experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet development. This new initiative is intended to complement the more industrially-driven approaches which are addressed under the FP7 Objective ""The Network of the Future"" within the FP7-ICT Workprogramme 2007-08. FIRE is focused on exploring new and radically better technological solutions for the future Internet, while preserving the ""good"" aspects of the current Internet, in terms of openness, freedom of expression and ubiquitous access. The FIRE activities are being launched in the 2nd ICT call, which closes in October 2007, under the FP7-ICT Objective 1.6 ""New Paradigms and Experimental Facilities"" (budget ε40m).

From 1979 to 1998, thirty-five technology-based organizations emerged from Xerox's research centers. Contradicting the common perception that Xerox “fumbled the future” by letting its technology walk out the door, in fact the company set in motion a series of deliberate initiatives to manage its spin-off organizations. After initially adopting a laissez-faire approach, the company soon turned to ad hoc methods, which evolved into a formal internal venture capital structure and culminated in a triage process, with the result that only companies perceived by Xerox as fitting into its overall corporate strategy were retained. By using spin-offs to withdraw gracefully from areas it considered to be marginal, Xerox for feited the potential to realize value from their research. Some, but not all, of the spin-offs obtained venture capital financing from outside sources and thus prospered independently. Their success demonstrated the opportunity that Xerox missed in managing its spin-offs.","2002","2023-02-14 23:14:14","2023-02-14 23:14:14","2023-02-14 23:14:13","803-837","","4","76","","Bus. Hist.

In this study, we present certain morphological evidence that supports this hypothesis. The 3D disposition of actin filaments and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in endothelial cells in situ was analyzed by using confocal microscopy and image reconstruction techniques. Surgical coarctations were made in guinea pig aortas, and the same 3D studies were conducted on such areas 1 week later. Stress fibers (SFs) were present at both basal and apical regions of endothelial cells regardless of coarctation, and several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were associated with SF ends. Apical SFs had one end attached to the apical cell membrane and the other attached to either the basal membrane or the lateral cell border. Within the coarctation area, the actin filament–containing and vinculin-containing structures became prominent, especially at the apical and the lateral regions. Substantially higher levels of anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Src staining were detected in the constricted area, particularly at the cell-cell apposition, whereas the anti–focal adhesion kinase, anti–CT10-related kinase, anti–platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-l, anti-vinculin, and phalloidin staining intensities increased only slightly after coarctation. We propose that apical SFs directly transmit the mechanical force of flow from the cell apex to the lateral and/or basal SF anchoring sites and that the SF ends associated with signaling molecules are sites of signal transduction. Our results support the idea that the cell apposition area is the major fluid shear stress–dependent mechanosignal transduction site in endothelial cells.","2000-03-03","2023-02-14 23:14:09","2023-02-14 23:14:09","2023-02-14 23:14:08","425-433","","4","86","","Circulation Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","bronze","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Signaling mediated by mechanical forces is likely to be involved in the upregulation of cardiac gap junctions during the early phase of cardiac hypertrophy and the subsequent downregulation in cardiac failure. Several signaling pathways involving cAMP, angiotensin II, transforming growth factor-β, vascular endothelial growth factor, and integrin-mediated regulators have been shown to affect expression of gap junction proteins. However, a comprehensive view of regulation of gap junction trafficking, synthesis, and degradation is still lacking. In addition to gap junction regulation by extracellular mechanical forces, there is a close relation between gap junctions and adhesion junctions and their linkage to the cytoskeleton. This can be inferred from experiments on neoformation of cell-to-cell coupling, concomitant upregulation of adherens and gap junctions after mechanical stretch, and human cardiomyopathies caused by genetic defects in cell-cell adhesion junction proteins. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the interaction between mechanical and functional cell-to-cell coupling remain to be elucidated.","2004-03-19","2023-02-14 23:14:00","2023-02-14 23:14:00","2023-02-14 23:13:59","585-591","","5","94","","Circulation Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","bronze","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last decade, many climatic parameters are more and more deviating from the mean values calculated over historical climatic time-series. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest since 1850. According to the preliminary data analysis of the last year, this trend is going to continue in 2018 as well. These climatic changes have accelerated the occurrence of droughts in many parts of the world including Europe and Asia. The North Western region is one such region in Sri Lanka which always affected by droughts due to its inherent dry weather condition. Although drought is considered as a normal part of the climate, its increasing negative impacts on human activities and the environment urges the application of novel technologies in drought monitoring. The 4onse project (analysis of Open, Non-conventional, Sustainable and Effective monitoring systems), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), is a project began in this context to address the aforementioned mentioned issues by deploying 27 open technologies based Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS) in Deduru Oya basin of Sri Lanka. These systems measure weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. Thanks to the collected data, it was possible to calculate some drought indexes to evaluate the intensity of the dry periods. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) has been selected as the principal indicator to evaluate droughts by integrating the 4onse data together with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset.","2019-08-23","2023-02-14 23:23:16","2023-02-14 23:23:16","2023-02-14 23:23:16","227-231","","","XLII-4/W14","","Int.

Instead of using a processor with an instruction set, a full stack of middleware, and an application program running on top, the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) integrate a cell set that can be configured in different ways. A few vendors have dominated this market with their proprietary tools, hardware devices, and boards, resulting in fragmented ecosystems with few standards and little interoperation. However, a new and complete toolchain for FPGAs with its associated open tools has recently emerged from the open-source community. Robotics is an expanding application field that may definitely benefit from this revolution, as fast speed and low power consumption are usual requirements. This paper hypothesizes that basic reactive robot behaviors may be easily designed following the reconfigurable computing approach and the state-of-the-art open FPGA toolchain. They provide new abstractions such as circuit blocks and wires for building intelligent robots. Visual programming and block libraries make such development painless and reliable. As experimental validation, two reactive behaviors have been created in a real robot involving common sensors, actuators, and in-between logic. They have been also implemented using classic software programming for comparison purposes. Results are discussed and show that the development of reactive robot behaviors using reconfigurable computing and open tools is feasible, also achieving a high degree of simplicity and reusability, and benefiting from FPGAs’ low power consumption and time-critical responsiveness.","2021-12-22","2023-02-14 23:22:51","2023-02-14 23:22:51","2023-02-14 23:22:51","8","","1","11","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Product customisation emphasises the fulfilment of explicit requirements of a defined market segment, but product individualisation targets at satisfying the particular needs of a customer. Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design approach comprising of an open hardware platform and multiple modules to be integrated with the platform. It gives freedom to end-users to integrate different modules into the platform as per their choice. Technological and strategic integration of all actors involved in the design process is the primary focus of this research. This paper identifies key areas which need to be focussed on to realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an explorative study of existing product design and customisation approaches. An industrial survey was conducted, and results for the industrial implication and insights on this approach are presented. The findings show that the end product from product design for MI will be more creative and innovative by the networking of all actors, and offers more individualised and technologically advanced products.","2021","2023-02-14 23:22:46","2023-02-14 23:22:46","2023-02-14 23:22:45","e16","","","7","","Des.

Second, the Commons-oriented wind turbine examined here is also meant to practically contribute to the quest for novel solutions to the timely problem of the need for (autonomous) renewable sources of energy, more in the sense of a development process than as a ready-to-apply solution. We demonstrate that it is possible for someone with partial initial knowledge to initiate a similar, complex project based on an interesting idea, and to succeed in implementing it through collaboration with Commons-oriented communities, while using peer-produced products and tools.

Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a set of numerical studies and experimental validations on an in-house cable-stayed bridge model in terms of the accuracy of identified dynamic properties.","2013","2023-02-14 23:22:19","2023-02-14 23:22:19","2023-02-14 23:22:18","1-9","","","2013","","Mathematical Problems in Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, there has been much interest in studying the role of biomechanical forces in cell biology and pathophysiology. This has led to the introduction and even commercialization of many experimental devices. Many of the early devices were limited by the heterogeneity of deformation of cells cultivated in different locations of the culture plate membranes and were also attached with complicated technical/electronic efforts resulting in a restriction of the reproducibility of these devices. The objective of this study was to design and build a simple device to allow the application of dose-dependent homogeneous equibiaxial static stretch to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes to investigate biological and biomedical questions. In addition, cultured neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes were stretched with the proposed device with different strain gradients. For the first time with this study we could demonstrate that stretch up to 21% caused dose-dependent changes in biological markers such as the calcineurin activity, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, voltage-gated potassium channel isoform 4.2, and voltage-gated K                +                channel-interacting proteins-2 gene expression and transient outward potassium current densities but not the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. With both markers mentioned last, dose-dependent stretch alterations could only be achieved with stretch up to 13%. The simple and low-cost device presented here might be applied to a wide range of experimental settings in different fields of research.","2008-01","2023-02-14 23:21:27","2023-02-14 23:21:27","2023-02-14 23:21:26","H532-H540","","1","294","","American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.","2005-08","2023-02-14 23:20:58","2023-02-14 23:20:58","2023-02-14 23:20:58","409-421","","4","16","","Organization Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the emergence and rapid development of sensor technologies, citizens potentially have more powerful tools to collect data and generate information to understand their living environment. Although sensor technologies are developing fast, citizen sensing has not been widely implemented yet and published studies are only a few. In this paper, we analyse the practical experiences from an implementation of citizen sensing for urban environment monitoring. A bottom-up model in which citizens develop and use sensors for environmental monitoring is described and assessed. The paper focuses on a case study of Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab using NO                2                sensors for air quality monitoring. We found that the bottom-up citizen sensing is still challenging but can be successful with open cooperation and effective use of online and offline facilities. Based on the assessment, suggestions are proposed for further implementations and research.","2016","2023-02-14 23:20:53","2023-02-14 23:20:53","2023-02-14 23:20:52","1-9","","","2016","","Journal of Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hardware is built using several low-cost, open-source, mass-produced components. The system automatically ingests data into HydroServer, a standards-based server in the open source hydrologic information system (HIS) created by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI). By publishing data in this way, they are discoverable through the geographic information system (GIS)-based CUAHSI tools, HydroDesktop and HydroShare. In addition, because they follow WaterML encoding, open hardware data stored in the HIS can be included in international catalog such as the global earth observation system of system catalog. A recipe for building the system is provided. Multiple deployments used to test proof-of-concept of the system are described and their results are given.

This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple downstream firms—a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple downstream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms’ costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This “scale-stealing” mechanism reduces the markets of upstream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.","2019-03","2023-02-14 23:20:39","2023-02-14 23:20:39","2023-02-14 23:20:38","41-57","","1","4","","Strategy Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","bronze","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With this aim, a preliminary WSN architecture is proposed. Several commercially available open-source platforms are compared and the Raspberry Pi stood out as a suitable and viable solution. The sensing layer is designed with two goals. Firstly, accelerometric, temperature, and relative humidity sensors were integrated on a dedicated PCB to test if mechanical or environmental stresses during bus rides could be harmful to the device or to its performances. The physical quantities are monitored automatically to alert the driver, thus improving the quality of service. Then, the rationale and functioning of the management and service layer is presented.

One way to support stronger end users’ engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users’ DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of                things                . We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.","2017-04-30","2023-02-14 23:20:12","2023-02-14 23:20:12","2023-02-14 23:20:12","1-29","","2","24","","ACM Trans.

Proximity data acquisition usually depends on a hardware solution to which some sensors can be coupled, managed by a software that may (or may not) store, process and send acquired data to a back-end using some communication protocol. The sheer number of both proprietary and open hardware solutions, together with the diversity and characteristics of available sensors, is enough to deem the task of designing a data acquisition device complex. Factoring in the harsh operational context, the multiple DIY solutions presented by an active online community, available in-field power approaches and the different communication protocols, each proximity monitoring solution can be regarded as singular. Data acquisition devices should be increasingly flexible, not only by supporting a large number of heterogeneous sensors, but also by being able to resort to different communication protocols, depending on both the operational and functional contexts in which they are deployed. Furthermore, these small and unattended devices need to be sufficiently robust and cost-effective to allow greater in-field measurement granularity 365 days/year. This paper presents a low-cost, flexible and robust data acquisition device that can be deployed in different operational contexts, as it also supports three different communication technologies: IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, LoRa/LoRaWAN and GRPS. Software and hardware features, suitable for using heat pulse methods to measure sap flow, leaf wetness sensors and others are embedded. Its power consumption is of only 83 μA during sleep mode and the cost of the basic unit was kept below the EUR 100 limit. In-field continuous evaluation over the past three years prove that the proposed solution—SPWAS’21—is not only reliable but also represents a robust and low-cost data acquisition device capable of gathering different parameters of interest in PA practices.","2021-06-30","2023-02-14 23:19:50","2023-02-14 23:19:50","2023-02-14 23:19:50","619","","7","11","","Agriculture","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Openness is viewed as one of the key principles of the maker movement. As the global maker movement is a bricolage of diverse and situated practices and traditions, there are also many different interpretations and ways of practicing openness. We have explored this diversity with an integrative literature review, relying on the Web of Science™ database. We identified three interrelated but also, in part, mutually contested approaches to openness. Firstly, openness often refers to applying open hardware. Secondly, it is in many cases related to the inclusion and empowerment of various groups in making. Thirdly, openness appears to be seen as a means to pursue economic growth through increasing innovation activity and entrepreneurship. Our results also highlight the substantial barriers encountered by makers while aiming to open up their practices. These barriers include: value conflicts in which openness is overridden by other important values; exclusion of lower income groups from making due to a lack of resources; and difficulties in maintaining long-term activities. The different meanings of openness together with the barriers create tensions within the maker movement while implementing openness. We propose that engaging in a reflexive futures dialogue on the consequences of these tensions can enhance the maker movement to become more open, inclusive and resilient.","2021-12-08","2023-02-14 23:19:39","2023-02-14 23:19:39","2023-02-14 23:19:39","13559","","24","13","","Sustainability","How Open Is the Maker Movement?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present three contributions towards making the field of acoustic holography more widespread. Firstly, we introduce an iterative algorithm that accurately calculates the amplitudes and phases of an array of ultrasound emitters in order to create a target amplitude field in mid-air. Secondly, we use the algorithm to analyse the impact of spatial, amplitude and phase emission resolution on the resulting acoustic field, thus providing engineering insights towards array design. For example, we show an onset of diminishing returns for smaller than a quarter-wavelength sized emitters and a phase and amplitude resolution of eight and four divisions per period, respectively. Lastly, we present a hardware platform for the generation of acoustic holograms. The array is integrated in a single board composed of 256 emitters operating at 40 kHz. We hope that the results and procedures described within this paper enable researchers to build their own ultrasonic arrays and explore novel applications of ultrasonic holograms.","2021-03-26","2023-02-14 23:19:33","2023-02-14 23:19:33","2023-02-14 23:19:33","2981","","7","11","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The battery system is the most expensive part in the majority of the e-mobility devices. Therefore, battery manufacturers tend to reduce the battery cost by using simple battery management systems that provide only basic safety features. Possible advanced functionalities are not implemented and the battery may lose performanceduring its use. Widely spread maintenance centers are thus required to support the mobility electrification process, but their diffusion is limited by the high cost ofprofessional battery characterization instruments. This work proposes an open-hardware low-cost battery maintenance tool architecture that can be used with common laboratory instruments. The tool is based on a relay-matrix and a battery monitor integrated circuit. It is able to completely characterize and optimize the state of a battery independently of the battery management system and also gives a figure of the individual aging of the battery cells. The work shows the architecture and the experimental validation of a 16-cells battery maintenance tool prototype. The results demonstrate that utilizing the tool brings the battery in the best possible state and identifies the degradation of the cells in terms of capacity and resistance.","2021-08-13","2023-02-14 23:19:28","2023-02-14 23:19:28","2023-02-14 23:19:27","4962","","16","14","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It analyses how the ideals held by DIY makers, such as openness, peer production, and individual empowerment, are formulated in relation to China’s project of building a creative society and economy. To demonstrate, this article draws from long-term ethnographic research, including the setting up of China’s first hackerspace, the proliferation of making, and partnerships between makers and manufacturers. China’s makers are driven to reinvent what creativity, innovation, industrial production and citizenship mean today, simultaneously exploiting and challenging political rhetoric. By setting up hackerspaces, designing open technologies and starting up businesses, they craft alternative subject positions, for themselves and others. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, it fills a gap in current research by providing an account of a culture of technology production. Second, it proposes the analytical lens of ‘making subjectivities’ to open up the concept of the netizen, illustrating the importance for Chinese Internet research to consider not only technology use, but also the culture and materials of its production. Third, it demonstrates that maker culture is better understood as a parasitic culture rather than a counterculture, altering the system from within, contributing to our understanding of the relationship between technology use, production, society, activism and the state.","2014-07","2023-02-14 23:18:55","2023-02-14 23:18:55","2023-02-14 23:18:55","145-167","","2","28","","China Information","Hackerspaces and the Internet of Things in China","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In-flight measurement of a mixed radiation field is a challenging deal that requires a small low-power-consumption battery-operated lightweight device with long endurance. A new innovative electronic design with a silicon PIN diode used as a sensor is presented, including full description and manufacturing documentation. The device was verified by measurements and compared with reference dosimeters widely used in aircraft dosimetry, such as Liulin MDU and HAWK TEPC. A comparison of the measurements with a computation model CARI 7 was performed as well. All the comparisons yield positive results within known errors. The new design of the dosimeter has a very satisfactory performance in terms of battery life and does not need calibration after manufacturing or recalibration after a long time of usage.  Open-source design predetermines AIRDOS for future improvements and open-science.","2021-03-01","2023-02-14 23:28:06","2023-02-14 23:28:06","2023-02-14 23:28:06","T03006","","03","16","","J.

Here we present the steps necessary to build a low-cost fixed-wing drone for environmental applications in large areas, along with instructions to increase the reliability of the system and testing its performance. Inspired by DIY (Do It Yourself) and open source models, this work prioritizes simplicity and accounts for cost-benefit for the researcher. The DIY fixed-wing drone developed has electric propulsion, can perform pre-programmed flight, can carry up to 500 g payload capacity with 65 minutes flight duration and flies at a maximum distance of 20 km. It is equipped with a RGB (Red, Green and Blue) sensor capable of obtaining 2.8 cm per pixel Ground Sample Distance (GSD) resolution at a constant altitude of 100 m above ground level (AGL). The total cost was $995 which is substantially less than the average value of similar commercial drones used in biodiversity studies. We performed 12 flight tests in auto mode using the developed model in protected areas in Brazil, obtaining RGB images that allowed us to identify deforestation spots smaller than 5 m                2                and medium-sized animals. Building DIY drones requires some technical knowledge and demands more time than buying a commercial ready-to-fly system, but as proved here, it can be less expensive, which is often crucial in conservation projects.","2021-08-13","2023-02-14 23:28:04","2023-02-14 23:28:04","2023-02-14 23:28:03","e0255559","","8","16","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","Müllerová, Jana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article describes the invention of a new testing system: the parametric open source cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS). POSCAS is an adapted gardening cold-frame used in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. It can both function as a traditional cold frame, but it can also be automated to function as a full-service greenhouse. The integrated PV module roof can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing agricultural and power production. It can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV module. An array of POSCAS systems allows for the testing of agrivoltaic impacts from the percent transparency of the modules by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material or the density of silicon-based cells, and various forms of optical enhancement, anti-reflection coatings and solar light spectral shifting materials in the back sheet. All agrivoltaic variables can be customized to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop.","2021-10-26","2023-02-14 23:28:01","2023-02-14 23:28:01","2023-02-14 23:28:00","71","","4","6","","Inventions","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As our health systems faced unexperienced pressure, being close to collapsing in some countries, and global supply chains failing to react immediately, makers started to prototype, locally produce and globally share designs of Open Source healthcare products, such as face shields and other medical supplies. Local collaboration with hospitals and healthcare professionals were established. These bottom-up initiatives from maker networks across the globe are showing us how responsible innovation is happening outside the constraints of profit-driven large industries. In this qualitative study we present five cases from a global network of makers that contributed to the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare-related products. We draw our cases from the experiences made in                Careables                , a mixed community of people and organizations committed to the co-design and making of open, personalized healthcare for everyone. With the presented cases we reflect on the potential implications for post-pandemic local production of healthcare products and analyze them from a social innovation perspective.

In this sense, the large development community that is being created around popular platforms is also contributing to the construction of Internet of Things applications, which can ultimately support the maturation of the smart-cities era. Popular platforms such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard and Arduino come as single-board open-source platforms that have enough computational power for different types of smart-city applications, while keeping affordable prices and encompassing many programming libraries and useful hardware extensions. As a result, smart-city solutions based on such platforms are becoming common and the surveying of recent research in this area can support a better understanding of this scenario, as presented in this article.

Robot PUMA 560 is probably the mathematically best-described robot, and therefore it is frequently used for research and educational purposes. A developed control environment consists of a robot controller and teach pendant. The advantage of using a personally developed solution is its open structure, which allows various tests and measurements to be performed, and that is highly convenient for educational and research purposes. The motivation behind the design of this personal didactic robot control environment arose from a survey for students after the first Summer School on Mechatronic Systems. The student questionnaire revealed severe discrepancies between theory and practice in education. Even though the primary purpose of the new control environment for robot PUMA 560 was research, it was established that it is a viable lab resource that allows for the connection between theoretical and industrial robotics. It was used for the duration of four Summer Schools and university courses. Since then, it has been fully integrated into International Burch University’s Electrical and Electronics Engineering curriculum through several courses on the bachelor and master levels for multidisciplinary problem-based learning (PBL) projects.","2020-12-08","2023-02-14 23:27:00","2023-02-14 23:27:00","2023-02-14 23:26:59","2090","","12","9","","Electronics","What’s in the Box","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hardware used for automating this process consists of embedded platforms (Arduino and Raspberry Pi) integrated into programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which are connected to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system implemented with an open source Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform. The main purpose of the proposed approach is to evaluate low-cost automation solutions (hardware and software) within the framework of modern industry requirements in order to determine whether these technologies could be enabling factors of IIoT. The proposed control strategy for regulating tank levels combines the classic PID algorithm and the fuzzy gain scheduling PID (FGS-PID) approach. Fault detection capabilities are also enabled for the system through a fault detection and diagnosis module (FDD) implemented with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The distributed controller’s (DC) algorithms are embedded into the PLC’s processors in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed system. Additionally, a remote human to machine interface (HMI) is deployed through a web client of the IIoT application. Experimental results show the proper operation of the overall system.","2020-07-08","2023-02-14 23:26:56","2023-02-14 23:26:56","2023-02-14 23:26:55","4696","","14","10","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km2) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments.","2020-04-04","2023-02-14 23:26:53","2023-02-14 23:26:53","2023-02-14 23:26:53","552","","4","12","","Symmetry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to introduce the Slow Tech approach in order to explain how to create a suitable bridge between business ethics and computer ethics.                                            Design/methodology/approach                – The paper’s approach is discursive. It provides a viewpoint. Its arguments are based in an examination of literature relevant to both business ethics and computer ethics. Justification is produced for the use of Slow Tech approach. A number of potential future research and application issues still to be investigated are also provided.                                            Findings                – Slow Tech can be proposed, and used, as a bridging mechanism between companies’ strategies regarding computer ethics and business ethics. Three case studies illustrate the kind of challenges that companies have to tackle when trying to implement Slow Tech in concrete business context. Further study need to be undertaken to make progress on Slow Tech in applied, corporate settings.                                            Practical implications                – ICT companies need to look for innovative, new approaches to producing, selling and recycling their services and products. A Slow Tech approach can provide such insights.                                            Social implications                – Today’s challenges to the production and use of good, clean, and fair ICT, both conceptual and concrete, can act as incentives for action: they can further applied research or encourage social activism. Encouraging the study, and the application, of Slow Tech provides a first step in the potential improvement of a society in which information technology is totally embedded.

They may be hosted by civic communities, corporations or public institutions. Working individually or in teams, usually for several days, participants develop projects such as hardware or software prototypes. Based on a digital ethnography of two events in the Netherlands and Denmark, this article investigates project development practices at hackathons. In particular, it analyses how participants organized their project work and which technologies were used in support of their creative endeavours. Hackathons are increasingly competitive rather than collaborative events, involving time pressure, inducements such as prizes, and requiring efficient skills utilization. I argue that this facilitates the following tendencies: Firstly, strategic effort is put into final presentations. Projects need to be convincingly presented, and persuasively pitching an idea becomes crucial. Secondly, there is only limited time for personal learning, since participants’ existing skills need to be efficiently applied if a team wants to stay competitive. This encourages division of labour within groups: a tendency which seems especially problematic given that IT skills biases are often expressed in terms of gender. Thirdly, participants are more inclined to use technologies that are proprietary but appear ‘open enough’. In light of this observation and by drawing on the concept of technology as resource and opportunity, I discuss the techno-political implications of utilized technologies. With this analysis, I aim at contributing to the critical debate on hackathons as productive but likewise ideologically significant fields of ‘hacking cultures’.","2019-12","2023-02-14 23:25:46","2023-02-14 23:25:46","2023-02-14 23:25:45","1000-1026","","5-6","25","","Convergence","Hacking events","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low-cost and low-power sensors are now readily available and commonly deployed by individuals and community groups. However, there are a wide range of such IoT devices in circulation that differently focus on problems of sensor validation, data reliability, or accessibility. In this paper, we present AirKit, which was developed as an integrated and open source “social IoT technology”. AirKit enables a comprehensive approach to citizen-sensing air quality through several integrated components: (1) the Dustbox 2.0, a particulate matter sensor; (2) Airsift, a data analysis platform; (3) a reliable and automatic remote firmware update system; (4) a “Data Stories” method and tool for communicating citizen data; and (5) an AirKit logbook that provides a guide for designing and running air quality projects, along with instructions for building and using AirKit components. Developed as a social technology toolkit to foster open processes of research co-creation and environmental action, Airkit has the potential to generate expanded engagements with IoT and air quality by improving the accuracy, legibility and use of sensors, data analysis and data communication.","2021-06-11","2023-02-14 23:25:27","2023-02-14 23:25:27","2023-02-14 23:25:27","4044","","12","21","","Sensors","AirKit","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They generate digital footprints that reveal the activity in the city over time and space, making possible a quantitative analysis of movements using bicycles in the city. A careful study relying on nonstationary statistical modeling and data mining allows us to first model the time evolution of the dynamics of movements with Vélo'v, that is mostly cyclostationary over the week with nonstationary evolutions over larger time-scales, and second to disentangle the spatial patterns to understand and visualize the flows of Vélo'v bicycles in the city.

In this paper, we present an everyday life application involving a WSN as the base of a novel context-awareness sports scenario, where physiological parameters are measured and sent to the WSN by wearable devices. Applications with several hardware components introduce the problem of heterogeneity in the network. In order to integrate different hardware platforms and to introduce a service-oriented semantic middleware solution into a single application, we propose the use of an enterprise service bus (ESB) as a bridge for guaranteeing interoperability and integration of the different environments, thus introducing a semantic added value needed in the world of IoT-based systems. This approach places all the data acquired (e.g., via internet data access) at application developers disposal, opening the system to new user applications.

Technologies such as powder-bed fusion (PBF) can process PP powder; however, much is still to learn concerning process parameters for reliable manufacturing. This study focusses in the process–property relationships of PP using laser-based PBF. The research presents an overview of the intrinsic and the extrinsic characteristic of a commercial PP powder as well as fabrication of tensile specimens with varying process parameters to characterize tensile, elongation at break, and porosity properties. The impact of key process parameters, such as power and scanning speed, are systematically modified in a controlled design of experiment. The results were compared to the existing body of knowledge; the outcome is to present a process window and optimal process parameters for industrial use of PP. The computer tomography data revealed a highly porous structure inside specimens ranging between 8.46% and 10.08%, with porosity concentrated in the interlayer planes in the build direction. The results of the design of experiment for this commercial material show a narrow window of 0.122 ≥ Ev ≥ 0.138 J/mm3 led to increased mechanical properties while maintaining geometrical stability.","2018-11-22","2023-02-14 23:25:00","2023-02-14 23:25:00","2023-02-14 23:24:59","1293","","12","10","","Polymers","Additive Manufacturing of Polypropylene","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study is to design and develop a modular UAV-based platform capable of real-time monitoring of multiple air pollutants. The system comprises five modules: the UAV, the ground station, the sensors, the data acquisition (DA) module, and the data fusion (DF) module. The hardware was constructed with off-the-shelf consumer parts and the open source software Ardupilot was used for flight control and data fusion. The prototype UAV system was tested in representative settings. Results show that this UAV platform can fly on pre-determined pathways with adequate flight time for various data collection missions. The system simultaneously collects air quality and high precision X-Y-Z data and integrates and visualizes them in a real-time manner. While the system can accommodate multiple gas sensors, UAV operations may electronically interfere with the performance of chemical-resistant sensors. Our prototype and experiments prove the feasibility of the system and show that it features a stable and high precision spatial-temporal platform for air sample collection. Future work should be focused on gas sensor development, plug-and-play interfaces, impacts of rotor wash, and all-weather designs.","2018-12-10","2023-02-14 23:24:46","2023-02-14 23:24:46","2023-02-14 23:24:45","4363","","12","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent applications have demonstrated the potential to improve flood forecasting, enhance rainwater harvesting, and prevent combined sewer overflows. However, adoption of smart water systems has been hindered by a limited number of proven case studies, along with a lack of guidance on how smart water systems should be built. To this end, we review existing solutions, and introduce                open storm                —an open-source, end-to-end platform for real-time monitoring and control of watersheds.                Open storm                includes (i) a robust hardware stack for distributed sensing and control in harsh environments (ii) a cloud services platform that enables system-level supervision and coordination of water assets, and (iii) a comprehensive, web-based “how-to” guide, available on open-storm.org, that empowers newcomers to develop and deploy their own smart water networks. We illustrate the capabilities of the                open storm                platform through two ongoing deployments: (i) a high-resolution flash-flood monitoring network that detects and communicates flood hazards at the level of individual roadways and (ii) a real-time stormwater control network that actively modulates discharges from stormwater facilities to improve water quality and reduce stream erosion. Through these case studies, we demonstrate the real-world potential for smart water systems to enable sustainable management of water resources.","2018","2023-02-14 23:24:43","2023-02-14 23:24:43","2023-02-14 23:24:42","346-358","","3","4","","Environ.

However, this area is less explored than other areas such as computer graphics and audio. Most advanced olfactory displays are designed for a specific experiment, they are hard to modify and extend, expensive, and/or can deliver a very limited number of scents. Additionally, current-generation olfactory displays make no decisions on if and when a scent should be released. This paper proposes a low-cost, easy to build, powerful smart olfactory display, that can release up to 24 different aromas and allow control of the quantity of the released aroma. The display is capable of absorbing back the aroma, in an attempt to clean the air prior to releasing a new aroma. Additionally, the display includes a smart algorithm that will decide when to release certain aromas. The device controller application includes releasing scents based on a timer, text in English subtitles, or input from external software applications. This allows certain applications (such as games) to decide when to release a scent, making it ideal for gaming. The device also supports native connectivity with games developed using a game development asset, developed as part of this project. The project was evaluated by 15 subjects and it was proved to have high accuracy when the scents were released with 1.5 minutes’ delay from each other.","2020-02-13","2023-02-14 23:24:11","2023-02-14 23:24:11","2023-02-14 23:24:10","1002","","4","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer.  A 23 factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peak-to-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed.  The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface.  The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly.  With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically.

This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named “CARTON”, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch.                                            Design/methodology/approach                User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON’s hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities.                                            Findings                Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task.

The economical designs, inputs and training helps to increase the maintainability indicators for industrial devices. This analysis can be helpful, among other cases, to compare systems, to achieve a better design regarding maintainability requirements, to improve this maintainability under specific industrial environment and to foresee maintainability problems due to eventual changes in a device operation conditions. With this purpose, this work first introduces the notion of ergonomics and human factors, maintainability and the implementation of assessment of human postures, including some important postures to perform maintenance activities. A simulation approach is used to identify the critical posture of the maintenance personnel and implements the defined postures with minimal loads on the personnel who use the equipment in a practical scenario. The simulation inputs are given to the designers to improve the workplace/equipment in order to high level of maintainability. Finally, the work concludes summarizing the more significant aspects and suggesting future research.","2017-09-26","2023-02-14 23:23:24","2023-02-14 23:23:24","2023-02-14 23:23:24","217-223","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, using the case of the Linux kernel development project, we build a model of community-based, evolutionary knowledge creation to study how thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the Internet to produce a knowledge-intensive, innovative product of high quality. By comparing and contrasting the Linux model with the traditional/commercial model of software development and firmbased knowledge creation efforts, we show how the proposed model of knowledge creation expands beyond the boundary of the firm. Our model suggests that the product development process can be effectively organized as an evolutionary process of learning driven by criticism and error correction.

Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.","2018-11-09","2023-02-14 23:32:58","2023-02-14 23:32:58","2023-02-14 23:32:58","47","","4","7","","JSAN","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the latter part of the article, we discuss the consequences of these shifts for contemporary research problems. In particular, we explore the problem of designed obsolescence, a core issue for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) research. We show how the framing of the maker, as an empowered subject, presents certain opportunities and limitations for this research discourse.

Most remote locations in these underdeveloped nations, for instance, in Africa, have to cope with the problem of interrupted electricity supply making healthcare practitioners often experience a helpless compulsion to compromise in providing quality medical attention, especially during childbirth. Along with many public, private and nongovernment initiatives, WE CARE Solar (hereafter WCS) – a social innovation venture comes with an idea of developing portable solar suitcases to respond to this intransigent problem.                                            Design/methodology/approach                This paper introduces a social enterprise that established its operation in Africa and so far has served in more than 30 similarly impoverished economies. Data was collected, analyzed using documentary research method. The authors have also collected and correlated the statements from the founder of WCS to complement the authors’ findings. With this paper, the authors intend to establish the type of innovation tools that are needed to provide value with a social innovation initiative in the health sector in the least developed country perspective. To facilitate better social outcomes and to ensure greater good, innovation requires to be accompanied by stakeholders’ involvement.                                            Findings                The findings indicate that WE CARE Solar has a positive social contribution toward ensuring safe motherhood and childbirth in underdeveloped countries by providing access to reliable solar power sources. The six-step social innovation process can be adopted by other social ventures to propose innovative solutions to social needs. Analyzing WCS's service delivery from the perspective of the 4As framework and value co-creation model, it is suggested that sustainable social change can be established with value co-creation through community engagement with multiple stakeholders.                                            Research limitations/implications                This research was solely focused on one organization alone. Future research could look into the model to ascertain its acceptability in similar social innovation in healthcare initiatives.                                            Originality/value                This paper attempts to address a gap in social innovation in healthcare and its adaptability using the 4As framework with the value co-creation model. The authors propose this model from the data accumulated throughout the research, which could also serve to assist organizations looking for scalable and sustainable change.","2020-10-08","2023-02-14 23:32:28","2023-02-14 23:32:28","2023-02-14 23:32:28","341-357","","4","16","","WJEMSD","Value co-creation through social innovation in healthcare","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such solutions are necessary in today’s robotics and industry: deprecated old control units render robotic installations useless and allow no upgrades, advancements, or innovation in an inherently innovative ecosystem. For the sake of simplicity, just the first robot axis is considered. The first approach described is a PC solution with data acquisition I/O board (Humusoft MF634). This board is supported with Matlab Real-Time Windows Toolbox for real-time applications and thus whole controller was designed in Matlab environment. The second approach is a robot controller developed on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) board. The complexity of FPGA design can be overcome by using a third party software package, such as self-developed Matlab FPGA Real Time Toolbox. In both cases, parameters of motion controller are calculated by using simulation of the PUMA 560 robot first axis motion. Simulations were conducted in Matlab/Simulink using Robotics Toolbox.","2020-06-11","2023-02-14 23:32:23","2023-02-14 23:32:23","2023-02-14 23:32:22","972","","6","9","","Electronics","Two Open Solutions for Industrial Robot Control","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, the development and efficient management of Network Services (NS) serving specific vertical industries and spanning across multiple administrative domains and heterogeneous infrastructures is challenging. The main challenges regard the efficient provision of NSs considering the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements per vertical industry along with the optimal usage of the allocated resources. Towards addressing these challenges, this paper details an innovative approach that we have developed for managing and orchestrating such NSs, called SONATA, and compare it with OSM and Cloudify, which are two of the most known open-source Management and Orchestration (MANO) frameworks. In addition to examining the supported orchestration mechanisms per MANO framework, an evaluation of main operational and functional KPIs is provided based on experimentation using a real testbed. The final aim is the identification of their strong and weak points, and the assessment of their suitability for serving diverse vertical industry needs, including of course the Internet of Things (IoT) service ecosystem.","2020-01-04","2023-02-14 23:32:17","2023-02-14 23:32:17","2023-02-14 23:32:16","4","","1","9","","JSAN","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, the attitude and position control challenges for a drone with a package connected by a wire is analysed. During the delivering task, it is very difficult to eliminate the external unpredictable disturbances. A robust neural network-based backstepping sliding mode control method is designed, which is capable of monitoring the drone’s flight path and desired attitude with a suspended cable attached. The convergence of the position and attitude errors together with the Lyapunov function are employed to attest to the robustness of the nonlinear transportation platform. The proposed control system is tested with a simulation and in an outdoor environment. The simulation and open field test results for the UAV transportation platform verify the controllers’ reliability.","2019-08-25","2023-02-14 23:31:25","2023-02-14 23:31:25","2023-02-14 23:31:25","931","","9","8","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in computer science have led to the development of a high number of low-cost sensors, improving the spatial and temporal resolution of air quality data while increasing the effectiveness of risk assessment. The main objective of this work is to perform a validation of a particulate matter (PM) sensor (HM-3301) in indoor and outdoor environments to study PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. To date, this sensor has not been evaluated in real-world situations, and its data quality has not been documented. Here, the HM-3301 sensor is integrated into an Internet of things (IoT) platform to establish a permanent Internet connection. The validation is carried out using a reference sampler (LVS3 of Derenda) according to EN12341:2014. It is focused on statistical insight, and environmental conditions are not considered in this study. The ordinary Linear Model, the Generalized Linear Model, Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing, and the Generalized Additive Model have been proposed to compare and contrast the outcomes. The low-cost sensor is highly correlated with the reference measure (    R 2     greater than 0.70), especially for PM2.5, with a very high accuracy value. In addition, there is a positive relationship between the two measurements, which can be appropriately fitted through the Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing model.","2019-12-16","2023-02-14 23:31:23","2023-02-14 23:31:23","2023-02-14 23:31:22","7220","","24","11","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The massive field data aggregation of distributed administered IoT devices allows new insights and actionable information for dynamic intelligent decision-making. In such distributed environments, data integrity, referring to reliability and consistency, is deemed insufficient and requires immediate facilitation. In this article, we introduce a distributed ledger (DLT)-based system for ensuring IoT data integrity which securely processes the aggregated field data. Its uniqueness lies in the embedded use of IOTA’s ledger, called “The Tangle”, used to transmit and store the data. Our approach shifts from a cloud-centric IoT system, where the Super nodes simply aggregate and push data to the cloud, to a node-centric system, where each Super node owns the data pushed in a distributed and decentralized database (i.e., the Tangle). The backend serves as a consumer of data and a provider of additional resources, such as administration panel, analytics, data marketplace, etc. The proposed implementation is highly modularand constitutes a significant contribution to the Open Source communities, regarding blockchain and IoT.","2019-09-18","2023-02-14 23:31:14","2023-02-14 23:31:14","2023-02-14 23:31:14","30","","3","2","","ASI","A Novel Combination of Distributed Ledger Technologies on Internet of Things","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OES minimize development cost and enhance portability while addressing widely known shortcomings of their proprietary counterparts. These shortcomings include the black box method of distribution which hinders integration to more complex systems. However, OES are highly dependent on the compatibility of each software components and essential benchmarking is required to ensure that the system can satisfy hard real-time constraints. To address these issues and the notion that OES will find broader distributed control applications, we provide detailed procedures in realizing OES based on an open source real-time operating system on various low-cost open embedded platforms. Their performance was evaluated and compared in terms of periodicity and schedulability, task synchronization, and interrupt response time, which are crucial metrics to determine stability and reliability of real-time controllers. Practical implementations, including the modernization of a multi-axis industrial robot controller, are described clearly to serve as a comprehensive reference on the integration of OES in industrial distributed control systems.","2019-02-17","2023-02-14 23:31:06","2023-02-14 23:31:06","2023-02-14 23:31:06","223","","2","8","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neural activity represents a functional readout of neurons that is increasingly important to monitor in a wide range of experiments. Extracellular recordings have emerged as a powerful technique for measuring neural activity because these methods do not lead to the destruction or degradation of the cells being measured. Current approaches to electrophysiology have a low throughput of experiments due to manual supervision and expensive equipment. This bottleneck limits broader inferences that can be achieved with numerous long-term recorded samples.                Approach.                We developed Piphys, an inexpensive open source neurophysiological recording platform that consists of both hardware and software. It is easily accessed and controlled via a standard web interface through Internet of Things (IoT) protocols.                Main results.

It allows scientists to perform synthetic biology and aligned experimentation on a high-throughput scale, massively increasing the solution space that can be examined for any given problem or question. However, establishing a biofoundry is a challenging undertaking, with numerous technical and operational considerations that must be addressed. Using collated learnings, here we outline several considerations that should be addressed prior to and during establishment. These include drivers for establishment, institutional models, funding and revenue models, personnel, hardware and software, data management, interoperability, client engagement and biosecurity issues. The high cost of establishment and operation means that developing a long-term business model for biofoundry sustainability in the context of funding frameworks, actual and potential client base, and costing structure is critical. Moreover, since biofoundries are leading a conceptual shift in experimental design for bioengineering, sustained outreach and engagement with the research community are needed to grow the client base. Recognition of the significant, long-term financial investment required and an understanding of the complexities of operationalization is critical for a sustainable biofoundry venture. To ensure state-of-the-art technology is integrated into planning, extensive engagement with existing facilities and community groups, such as the Global Biofoundries Alliance, is recommended.","2021-02-17","2023-02-14 23:30:28","2023-02-14 23:30:28","2023-02-14 23:30:27","ysaa026","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of its key functions is to act as a knowledge hub to aggregate, disseminate and promote experience and know-how; for example, by profiling CS projects and collecting tools, resources and training materials relevant to both fields.

In these narratives, citizen participation in design and intellectual property management based on open source principles are the promise of more sustainable production models. In this context, openness in product design and development has been the object of growing interest and experimentation from academia, businesses and grassroots communities. As a result, numerous concepts emerged that attempt to grasp the essence of this phenomenon, unfortunately leading to overlapping, conflicting or speculative depictions. In this article, we share the understanding we gained throughout 6 years of research on Open Design and Open Source Hardware and attempt to make the difference between myths and facts. We depict an enthusiastic but realistic picture of Open Design and Open Source Hardware practices as we could observe them and deliver a structured framework to situate concepts and their differences. From this, we share seven observations leading to seven corresponding research questions and establish a research agenda to stimulate further investigations into this socially relevant and potentially ground-breaking phenomenon.","2021","2023-02-14 23:30:16","2023-02-14 23:30:16","2023-02-14 23:30:16","e22","","","7","","Des.

This paper presents an accurate and up-to-date energy consumption model for devices using this IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode. The model identifies all network-related CPU and radio state changes, thus providing a precise representation of the device behavior and an accurate prediction of its energy consumption. Moreover, energy measurements were performed with a dual-band OpenMote device, running the OpenWSN firmware. This allows the model to be used for devices using 2.4 GHz, as well as 868 MHz. Using these measurements, several network simulations were conducted to observe the TSCH energy consumption effects in end-to-end communication for both frequency bands. Experimental verification of the model shows that it accurately models the consumption for all possible packet sizes and that the calculated consumption on average differs less than 3% from the measured consumption. This deviation includes measurement inaccuracies and the variations of the guard time. As such, the proposed model is very suitable for accurate energy consumption modeling of TSCH networks.","2018-02-02","2023-02-14 23:30:10","2023-02-14 23:30:10","2023-02-14 23:30:10","437","","2","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arduino, a representative and popular open-source hardware, can acquire information from various sensors, transmit data using communication technology, and control devices through actuators. The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future.","2020-07-21","2023-02-14 23:29:40","2023-02-14 23:29:40","2023-02-14 23:29:40","5018","","14","10","","Applied Sciences","Applications of the Open-Source Hardware Arduino Platform in the Mining Industry","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous oceanographic modelling and current drifter data have been used to predict the movement and accumulation of plastic pollution in the marine environment, but our understanding of the transport and fate through riparian systems is still largely unknown. Here we undertook a proof of concept study by applying open source tracking technology (both GPS (Global Positing System) cellular networks and satellite technology), which have been successfully used in many animal movement studies, to track the movements of individual plastic litter items (500 ml PET (polyethylene terephthalate) drinks bottles) through the Ganges River system (known as the Ganga in India and the Padma and Meghna in Bangladesh, hereafter known as the Ganges) and the Bay of Bengal. Deployed tags were successfully tracked through the Ganges river system and into the Bay of Bengal marine system. The “bottle tags” were designed and built (e.g. shape, size, buoyancy) to replicate true movement patterns of a plastic bottle. The maximum distance tracked to date is 2845 km over a period of 94 days. We discuss lessons learnt from the development of these plastic litter tags, and outline how the potential widespread use of this open source technology has the ability to significantly increase understanding of the location of accumulation areas and the timing of large inputs of plastic pollution into the aquatic system. Furthermore, “bottle tags” may act as a powerful tool for stimulating social behaviour change, informing science-based policy, and as valuable educational outreach tools for public awareness.","2020-12-02","2023-02-14 23:29:37","2023-02-14 23:29:37","2023-02-14 23:29:36","e0242459","","12","15","","PLoS ONE","Message in a bottle","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","Dias, João Miguel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The small fixed-wing UAV called Xiang Fei is developed independently by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The flight control system is designed based on an open-source autopilot (Pixhawk). Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS is introduced due to its high accuracy. Some modifications on the longitudinal and lateral guidance laws are achieved to improve the flight control performance. Moreover, a data fusion based fault-tolerant control scheme is integrated in altitude control and speed control for altitude sensor failure and airspeed sensor failure, which are the common problems for small fixed-wing UAV. Finally, the real flight experiments are implemented to test the fault-tolerant control based autopilot of UAV. Real flight test results are given and analyzed in detail, which show that the fixed-wing UAV can track the desired altitude and speed commands during the whole flight process including takeoff, climbing, cruising, gliding, landing, and wave-off by the fault-tolerant control based autopilot.","2016","2023-02-14 23:29:25","2023-02-14 23:29:25","2023-02-14 23:29:25","1-7","","","2016","","Mathematical Problems in Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only are the 3D model collections of popular websites like                  Thingiverse.com                  growing, organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution and NASA have also recently begun to build collections of 3D models and make these openly accessible online. Yet, even with increased interest in 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies, little is known about the overall structure of the 3D models available on the internet. The paper aims to discuss this issue.                                                            Design/methodology/approach                – To initiate this project, a list was built of 33 of the most widely used 3D model websites on the internet. Freely downloadable models, as well as models available for purchase or as 3D printed objects were included in the list. Once the list of 33 websites was created, the data for each individual 3D model in the collections was manually assembled and recorded. The titles of the 3D models, keywords, subject headings, license information, and number of views and downloads were recorded, as this information was available. The data were gathered between January and May 2015, and compiled into a CSV database. To determine how online 3D model content relates to a variety of educational disciplines, relevant subject terms for a variety of educational disciples were extracted from the EBSCO database system. With this list of subject terms in hand, the keywords in the CSV database of model information were searched for each of the subject terms, with an automated process using a Perl script.                                            Findings                – There have been many teachers, professors, librarians and students who have purchased 3D printers with little or no 3D modelling skills. Without these skills the owners of these 3D printers are entirely reliant on the content created and freely shared by others to make use of their 3D printers. As the data collected for this research paper shows, the vast majority of open 3D model content available online pertains to the professions already well versed in 3D modelling and Computer Aided Design design, such as engineering and architecture.                                            Originality/value                – Despite that fact that librarians, teachers and other educators are increasingly using technologies that rely on open 3D model content as educational tools, no research has yet been done to assess the number of 3D models available online and what educational disciplines this content relates to. This paper attempts to fill this gap, providing an overview of the size of this content, the educational disciplines this content relates to and who has so far been responsible for developing this content. This information will be valuable to librarians and teachers currently working with technology such as 3D printers and virtual reality, as well as those considering investing in this technology.","2016-06-20","2023-02-14 23:29:23","2023-02-14 23:29:23","2023-02-14 23:29:22","239-258","","2","34","","","Cataloging the 3D web","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building.","2019-09-18","2023-02-14 23:28:26","2023-02-14 23:28:26","2023-02-14 23:28:26","4017","","18","19","","Sensors","Elemental","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, education in the theoretical basis and hands-on practice of electrophysiological techniques is essential for biomedical students, including at the undergraduate level. However, offering hands-on learning experiences is particularly difficult in environments with limited resources and infrastructure.                                            Methods:                In 2017, we began a project to design and incorporate electrophysiology laboratory practicals into our Biomedical Physics undergraduate curriculum at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. We describe some of the challenges we faced, how we maximized resources to overcome some of these challenges, and in particular, how we used open scholarship approaches to build both educational and research capacity.                                            Results:                We succeeded in developing a number of experimental and data analysis practicals in electrophysiology, including electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrooculogram techniques. The use of open tools, open platforms, and open licenses was key to the success and broader impact of our project. We share examples of our practicals and explain how we use these activities to strengthen interdisciplinary learning, namely the application of concepts in physics to understanding functions of the human body.                                            Conclusions:                Open scholarship provides multiple opportunities for universities to build capacity.

The considered class of vehicles suffers from light load, and, therefore, only a limited amount of sensors and computing devices can be installed on-board. Then, to make the prototype capable of moving autonomously along a fixed trajectory, a “cyber-pilot”, able on demand to replace the human operator, has been implemented on an embedded control board. This cyber-pilot overrides the commands thanks to a custom hardware signal mixer. The drone is able to localize itself in the environment without ground assistance by using a camera possibly mounted on a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) gimbal suspension. A computer vision system elaborates the video stream pointing out land markers with known absolute position and orientation. This information is fused with accelerations from a 6-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to generate a “virtual sensor” which provides refined estimates of the pose, the absolute position, the speed and the angular velocities of the drone. Due to the importance of this sensor, several fusion strategies have been investigated. The resulting data are, finally, fed to a control algorithm featuring a number of uncoupled digital PID controllers which work to bring to zero the displacement from the desired trajectory.","2021-01-08","2023-02-14 23:37:26","2023-02-14 23:37:26","2023-02-14 23:37:25","391","","2","21","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve—addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.","2014-03-01","2023-02-14 23:37:17","2023-02-14 23:37:17","2023-02-14 23:37:17","011003","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current navigation systems are highly dependent on the global positioning system and are prone to error because of global positioning system signal outages. However, advancements in onboard processing have enabled inertial navigation algorithms to perform well during short global positioning system outages. In this article, we propose an intelligent optical flow–based algorithm combined with Kalman filters to provide the navigation capability during global positioning system outages and global positioning system–denied environments. Traditional optical flow measurement uses block matching for motion vector calculation that makes the measurement task computationally expensive and slow. We propose the application of an artificial bee colony–based block matching technique for faster optical flow measurements. To effectively fuse optical flow data with inertial sensors output, we employ a modified form of extended Kalman filter. The modifications make the filter less noisy by utilizing the redundancy of sensors.

A crucial aspect is the ability to search for the boundaries of the wildfire by exploring a wide area. However, even as wildfires are increasing today, the number of available monitoring systems that can provide support is decreasing, creating an operational gap and slow response in such urgent situations. The objective of this work is to estimate a propagating boundary and create an autonomous system that works in real time. It proposes a coordination strategy with a new methodology for estimating the periphery of a propagating phenomenon using limited observations. The complete system design, tested on the high-fidelity simulation, demonstrates that steering the vehicles toward the highest perpendicular uncertainty generates the effective predictions. The results indicate that the new coordination scheme has a large beneficial impact on uncertainty suppression. This study thus suggests that an efficient solution for suppressing uncertainty in monitoring a wildfire is to use a fleet of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles that can be deployed quickly. Further research is needed on other deployment schemes that work in different natural disaster case studies.","2018-11-18","2023-02-14 23:37:03","2023-02-14 23:37:03","2023-02-14 23:37:02","1-12","","","2018","","Journal of Robotics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One challenge of critical importance to society is detecting and localizing airborne volatile chemicals. Many flying animals depend their ability to detect and locate the source of aerial chemical plumes for finding mates and food sources. A robot with comparable capability could reduce human hazard and drastically improve performance on tasks such as locating disaster survivors, hazardous gas leaks, incipient fires, or explosives. Three advances are needed before they can rival their biological counterparts: (1) a chemical sensor with a much faster response time that nevertheless satisfies the size, weight, and power constraints of flight, (2) a design, sensor suite, and control system that allows it to move toward the source of a plume fully autonomously while navigating obstacles, and (3) the ability to detect the plume with high specificity and sensitivity among the assortment of chemicals that invariably exist in the air. Here we address the first two, introducing a human-safe palm-sized air vehicle equipped with the odor-sensing antenna of an insect, the first odor-sensing biohybrid robot system to fly. Using this sensor along with a suite of additional navigational sensors, as well as passive wind fins, our robot orients upwind and navigates autonomously toward the source of airborne plumes. Our robot is the first flying biohybrid system to successfully perform odor localization in a confined space, and it is able to do so while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its flight path. We show that insect antennae respond more quickly than metal oxide gas sensors, enabling odor localization at an improved speed over previous flying robots. By using the insect antennae, we anticipate a feasible path toward improved chemical specificity and sensitivity by leveraging recent advances in gene editing.","2020-03-01","2023-02-14 23:36:49","2023-02-14 23:36:49","2023-02-14 23:36:48","026002","","2","16","","Bioinspir.

Technologies that were ubiquitous barely a decade ago, like floppy disks, now look like archaeological relics. It takes only a few years, if not months, before software environments are replaced by newer versions, often with limited backward compatibility. At the same time, digital technologies rely on hardware that has short life expectancy. The radical obsolescence of this new digital register raises a number of important questions. How are we going to prevent the fragile memories of contemporary digital cultures from receding into oblivion? This essay answers this question by looking at one of the institutions in which the problems associated with digital fragility are most especially felt, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and by exploring the ontological displacements that digital objects are operating at the heart of the museum.","2020-01-01","2023-02-14 23:36:43","2023-02-14 23:36:43","2023-02-14 23:36:43","215-245","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","green","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gyro, accelerator, and magnetometer information are fused together to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is at static state or uniformly moving state; and the gyro only is used to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is accelerating or decelerating.

While mechanical, chemical, and biological methods exist for the identification and treatment of these invasive species, they are manually intensive, inefficient, costly, and can cause collateral ecological damage. To address current deficiencies in aquatic weed management, this paper details the development of a small fleet of fully autonomous boats capable of subsurface hydroacoustic imaging (to scan aquatic vegetation), machine learning (for automated weed identification), and herbicide deployment (for vegetation control). These capabilities aim to minimize manual labor and provide more efficient, safe (reduced chemical exposure to personnel), and timely weed management. Geotagged hydroacoustic imagery of three aquatic plant varieties (Hydrilla, Cabomba, and Coontail) was collected and used to create a software pipeline for subsurface aquatic weed classification and distribution mapping. Employing deep learning, the novel software achieved a classification accuracy of 99.06% after training.","2019-06-13","2023-02-14 23:36:02","2023-02-14 23:36:02","2023-02-14 23:36:02","2410","","12","9","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the limitations of using existing non-intelligent, slow-responding, deficient gas sensors, we propose a novel artificial-intelligent-based multiple hazard gas detector (MHGD) system that is mounted on a motor vehicle-based robot which can be remotely controlled. First, we optimized the sensor array for the classification of three hazardous gases, including cigarette smoke, inflammable ethanol, and off-flavor from spoiled food, using an e-nose with a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber can prevent the impact of environmental changes. We compared the classification results of all combinations of sensors, and selected the one with the highest accuracy (98.88%) as the optimal sensor array for the MHGD. The optimal sensor array was then mounted on the MHGD to detect and classify the target gases without a mixing chamber but in a controlled environment.

Whilst motivations for participation can vary, communities affected by pollution frequently have changemaking as their goal. Social innovation is closely aligned with citizen sensing, however the process of co-creating practices and solutions with citizens who wish to shape their world can be highly complex to design. Therefore, our research articulates an action-orientated framework which emerges from a 2-year pan European project by which follow-on communities may replicate sensing initiatives more easily. The authors examine five studies and explore the cross-cutting principles, phases, stakeholders, methods, and challenges which form this framework. The authors argue that whilst data collection and data awareness are crucial to the citizen sensing process, there are precursory and subsequent stages which are necessary to equip citizens to address complex environmental challenges and take action on them. Therefore, this paper focuses on the stages and methods which are distinctive to citizen sensing. It concludes with recommendations for future practice for citizen sensing and citizen science.","2021-04-16","2023-02-14 23:35:42","2023-02-14 23:35:42","2023-02-14 23:35:42","629700","","","6","","Front.

Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King’s College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors –0.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales.","2021-06","2023-02-14 23:35:37","2023-02-14 23:35:37","2023-02-14 23:35:36","305-338","","3","45","","Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment","Low-cost electronic sensors for environmental research","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a prototype, built with low-cost wearable sensors, that was used to capture data from 25 subjects while seated (at resting state), walking, and seated (after a gentle stroll). We used this data to evaluate how the different combinations of signals affected the biometric verification process. Our results showed that the low-cost sensors currently being embedded in many fitness bands and smart-watches can be combined to enable biometric verification. We report and compare the results obtained by all tested configurations. Our best configuration, which uses ECG, PPG and GSR, obtained 0.99 area under the curve and 0.02 equal error rate with only 60 s of training data.

Sensor timing using dedicated hardware is the de-facto method to achieve optimal sensor performance, but the solutions available today have limited flexibility and requires much effort when changing sensors. This article presents requirements and suggestions for a highly accurate, reconfigurable sensor timing system that simplifies integration of sensor systems and navigation systems for UAVs. Both typical avionics sensors, like GNSS receivers and IMUs, and more complex sensors, such as cameras, are supported. To verify the design, an implementation named the SenTiBoard was created, along with a software support package and a baseline sensor-suite. With the solution presented in this paper we get a measurement resolution of 10 nanoseconds and we can transfer up to 7.6 megabytes per second. If the sensor suite includes a GNSS receiver with a pulse-per-second (PPS) reference, the sensor measurements can be related to an absolute time reference (UTC) with a clock drift of 1.9 microseconds per second RMS. An experiment was carried out, using a Mini Cruiser fixed-wing UAV, where errors in georeferencing infrared images were reduced with a factor of 4 when compared to a software synchronization method.","2018-07-30","2023-02-14 23:35:09","2023-02-14 23:35:09","2023-02-14 23:35:09","2468","","8","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This need becomes more evident in vineyards on the farms of the demarcated Douro region due to the specificities of the territory and the vineyards themselves. Thus, it is necessary to have low cost sensors which are, essentially, easy to install and maintain. In the present work, a node with these characteristics was developed, which, in addition, is low consumption and communicates wirelessly through a Long Rang Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) network. To obtain an easy installation, a library of clusters was created for the LoRaWAN network and dedicated to sensors used in agriculture, especially those using an asynchronous serial protocol for intelligent sensors. Three nodes were developed and tested with sensors used in agriculture to measure several environmental parameters (soil and air temperature; wind speed, gust and direction; soil water content, water tension and electrical conductivity; solar radiation; precipitation; atmospheric and vapor pressure; relative humidity; and lightning strikes count). The three nodes send data to a server through an existing gateway on the farm. The data are decoded and sent to an Internet-of-Things analytics platform where it is aggregated, viewed and analyzed. Samples of the data collected are presented. The developed nodes are of small dimensions (    85 × 65 × 35  m m     ), thus making them easy to handle and install. Energy consumption depends on the distance to the gateway, and the number and type of sensors connected to each node. In the implemented cases, the maximum consumption was ≈    400 μ A    . The development of a cluster based library makes the node plug-and-play. The developed nodes will be a great step forward for the use of wireless sensors in smart agriculture in Douro vineyards.","2020-06-12","2023-02-14 23:34:49","2023-02-14 23:34:49","2023-02-14 23:34:49","987","","6","9","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advancing the different technological aspects of these solutions requires effective IoT implementations and experimentations. This is widely addressed following low-cost and scalable methods such as analytical modeling and simulation. However, such methods are limited in capturing physical characteristics and network conditions in a realistic manner. Therefore, this paper presents an innovative IoT testbed system which facilitates practical experimentation of different IoT solutions in an effective environment. The testbed design was developed towards a general-purpose multidimensional support of different IoT properties including sensing, communication, gateway, energy management, data processing, and security. The implementation of the testbed was realized based on integrating a set of robust hardware components and developing a number of software modules. To illustrate its effectiveness, the testbed was utilized to experiment with energy efficiency of selected IoT communication technologies. This resulted in lower energy consumption using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology compared to the Zigbee and 6LoWPAN technologies. A further evaluation study of the system was carried out following the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). As the study results indicated, the system provides a simple yet efficient platform for conducting practical IoT experiments. It also had positive impact on users’ behavior and attitude toward IoT experimentation.","2020-10-13","2023-02-14 23:34:40","2023-02-14 23:34:40","2023-02-14 23:34:40","1-17","","","2020","","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","A Multidimensional Internet of Things Testbed System","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","Yang, Shuhui","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CopterSonde is an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) developed in house by a team of engineers and meteorologists at the University of Oklahoma. The CopterSonde is an ambitious attempt by the Center for Autonomous Sensing and Sampling to address the challenge of filling the observational gap present in the lower atmosphere among the currently used meteorological instruments such as towers and radiosondes. The CopterSonde is a unique and highly flexible platform for in situ atmospheric boundary layer measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution, suitable for meteorological applications and research. Custom autopilot algorithms and hardware features were developed as solutions to problems identified throughout several field experiments carried out since 2017. In these field experiments, the CopterSonde has been proven capable of safely operating at wind speeds up to 22 m s−1, flying at 3050 m above mean sea level, and operating in extreme temperatures: nearly −20 ∘C in Finland and 40 ∘C in Oklahoma, United States. Leveraging the open-source ArduPilot autopilot code has allowed for seamless integration of custom functions and protocols for the acquisition, storage, and distribution of atmospheric data alongside the flight control data. This led to the development of features such as the “wind vane mode” algorithm, which commands the CopterSonde to always face into the wind. It also inspired the design of an asymmetric airframe for the CopterSonde, which is shown to provide more suitable locations for weather sensor placement, in addition to allowing for improvements in the overall aerodynamic characteristics of the CopterSonde. Moreover, it has also allowed the team to design and create a modular shell where the sensor package is attached and which can run independently of the CopterSonde's main body. The CopterSonde is on the trend towards becoming a smart UAS tool with a wide possibility of creating new adaptive and optimized atmospheric sampling strategies.","2020-05-29","2023-02-14 23:34:35","2023-02-14 23:34:35","2023-02-14 23:34:34","2833-2848","","5","13","","Atmos.

A 1-year data set of ground-based GPS signal observations aiming at geometric elevation angles below +2° is analysed. Within the ""GLESER"" measurement campaign about 2600 validated setting events were recorded by the ""OpenGPS"" open-loop tracking receiver at an observation site located at 52.3808° N, 13.0642° E between January and December 2014. The measurements confirm the feasibility of open-loop signal tracking down to geometric elevation angles of −1 to −1.5° extending the corresponding closed-loop tracking range by up to 1°. The study is based on the premise that observations of low-elevation events by a ground-based receiver may serve as test cases for space-based radio occultation measurements, even if the latter proceed at a significantly faster temporal scale. The results support the conclusion that the open-loop Doppler model has negligible influence on the derived carrier frequency profile for strong signal-to-noise density ratios above about 30 dB Hz. At lower signal levels, however, the OpenGPS receiver's dual-channel design, which tracks the same signal using two Doppler models differing by 10 Hz, uncovers a notable bias. The repeat patterns of the GPS orbit traces in terms of azimuth angle reveal characteristic signatures in both signal amplitude and Doppler frequency with respect to the topography close to the observation site. Mean vertical refractivity gradients, extracted from ECMWF meteorological fields, correlate weakly to moderately with observed signal amplitude fluctuations at geometric elevation angles between +1 and +2°. Results from multiple phase screen simulations support the interpretation that these fluctuations are at least partly produced by atmospheric multipath; at negative elevation angles diffraction at the ground surface seems to contribute.","2017-01-03","2023-02-14 23:34:19","2023-02-14 23:34:19","2023-02-14 23:34:18","15-34","","1","10","","Atmos.

Several addictive psychostimulants, antidepressants, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) therapeutics inhibit DAT function, and multiple DAT mutants have been reported in ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, and infantile Parkinsonism. Given that aberrant DAT function underlies many pathological conditions, it is critical to understand intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that modulate DAT function. DAT availability at the cell surface is dynamically modulated, but the mechanisms controlling this process are not well understood. In the current study, we identified the penultimate mechanism that controls DAT stability at the cell surface. Moreover, by genetically manipulating this mechanism, we successfully rescued an ADHD-associated DAT mutant with intrinsic membrane instability. Thus, targeting DAT regulatory mechanisms may be a viable approach for treating dysregulated DAT.            ,               The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) facilitates high-affinity presynaptic DA reuptake that temporally and spatially constrains DA neurotransmission. Aberrant DAT function is implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. DAT is a major psychostimulant target, and psychostimulant reward strictly requires binding to DAT. DAT function is acutely modulated by dynamic membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and a PKC-sensitive negative endocytic mechanism, or “endocytic brake,” controls DAT plasma membrane stability. However, the molecular basis for the DAT endocytic brake is unknown, and it is unknown whether this braking mechanism is unique to DAT or common to monoamine transporters. Here, we report that the cdc42-activated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1, is a DAT endocytic brake that stabilizes DAT at the plasma membrane and is released in response to PKC activation. Pharmacologic and shRNA-mediated Ack1 silencing enhanced basal DAT internalization and blocked PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, but had no effects on SERT endocytosis. Both cdc42 activation and PKC stimulation converge on Ack1 to control Ack1 activity and DAT endocytic capacity, and Ack1 inactivation is required for stimulated DAT internalization downstream of PKC activation. Moreover, constitutive Ack1 activation is sufficient to rescue the gain-of-function endocytic phenotype exhibited by the ADHD DAT coding variant, R615C. These findings reveal a unique endocytic control switch that is highly specific for DAT. Moreover, the ability to rescue the DAT(R615C) coding variant suggests that manipulating DAT trafficking mechanisms may be a potential therapeutic approach to correct DAT coding variants that exhibit trafficking dysregulation.","2015-12-15","2023-02-14 23:33:58","2023-02-14 23:33:58","2023-02-14 23:33:57","15480-15485","","50","112","","Proc.

The concept ‘collective action framing’ is borrowed from social movement theory to describe how hackers have appropriated notions of a post-industrial, information society in their struggles against intellectual property laws and state censorship. Hackers have reintroduced an element of conflict and antagonism into otherwise politically innocuous visions of post-industrialism. This residual of antagonism can be traced back to the roots of the post-industrial myth in Marxist, historical materialist theory. By exploring these origins, the article proceeds to compare the hopes invested by hackers in the emancipatory force of information technology with the earlier beliefs of labour movements that the forces of history were on their side. Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.","2013-12","2023-02-14 23:33:49","2023-02-14 23:33:49","2023-02-14 23:33:49","1277-1293","","8","15","","New Media & Society","Determining social change","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes the sensors developed in collaboration with technology-based enterprises (aerial drone, floating drone, and underwater drone), and the methodology for integration of the different types of data acquired to monitor the reservoirs of the SRB. The proposed solution was applied to 21 reservoirs of the SRB. The proposed methodology is based on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for photogrammetry of the reservoir surface area. For each reservoir, two flights were completed, with 20 cm and 5 cm resolution, respectively. Then, a triangular irregular network mesh was generated by GIS techniques. Surface water vehicles (USV) and underwater remote-operated vehicles (ROV) were used to undertake bathymetric surveys. In addition, water quality measurements were made with an ROV device. The main results consist of topographic and bathymetric measurements for each reservoir, obtained by using equipment based on OpenSource technology.

AGILE allows developers to implement and deliver a complete (software and hardware) IoT solution for managing non-IP IoT devices through a multi-service gateway. Moreover, it simplifies the access of startups to the IoT market, not only providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for industries but also allowing end-users to customize and extend it according to their specific requirements. This flexibility is the result of the joint experience of established organizations in the project consortium already promoting the principles of openness, both at the software and hardware levels.

A major problem in its cure is its early screening and detection, which will decide on its treatment. Due to the fast contactless spreading of the virus, its screening is unusually difficult. Moreover, the results of COVID-19 tests may take up to 48 h. That is enough time for the virus to worsen the health of the affected person. The health community needs effective means for identification of the virus in the shortest possible time. In this study, we invent a medical device utilized consisting of composable sensors to monitor remotely and in real-time the health status of those who have symptoms of the coronavirus or those infected with it. The device comprises wearable medical sensors integrated using the Arduino hardware interfacing and a smartphone application. An IoT framework is deployed at the backend through which various devices can communicate in real-time. The medical device is applied to determine the patient’s critical status of the effects of the coronavirus or its symptoms using heartbeat, cough, temperature and Oxygen concentration (SpO2) that are evaluated using our custom algorithm. Until now, it has been found that many coronavirus patients remain asymptomatic, but in case of known symptoms, a person can be quickly identified with our device. It also allows doctors to examine their patients without the need for physical direct contact with them to reduce the possibility of infection. Our solution uses rule-based decision-making based on the physiological data of a person obtained through sensors. These rules allow to classify a person as healthy or having a possibility of infection by the coronavirus.

This paper presents the open universal framework intended for fast prototyping or building a short series of specialized flying monitoring systems able to work in urban and industrial areas. The proposed framework combines mobility of UAV with IoT measurements and full-stack WebRTC communications. WebRTC offers simultaneous transmission of both a real-time video stream and the flow of data coming from sensors, and ensures a kind of protection of data flow, which leads to preserving its near-real-time character and enables contextual communication. Addition of the AI accelerator hardware makes this system AI-ready, i.e., the IoT communication hub, which is the air component of our system, is able to perform tasks of AI-supported computing. The exemplary prototype of this system was evaluated in terms of the ability to work with fast-response sensors, the ability to work with high temporal and high spatial resolutions, video information in poor visibility conditions and AI-readiness. Results show that prototypes based on the proposed framework are able to meet the challenges of monitoring systems in smart cities and industrial areas.","2021-06-12","2023-02-14 23:33:04","2023-02-14 23:33:04","2023-02-14 23:33:03","4061","","12","21","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since biosensing devices are nowadays very common in developed countries, particularly in the field of diagnostics, they are at a stage of maturity at which other potential outcomes can be explored, especially on their possibilities for multiplexing and automation to reduce the time-to-results. However, the translation is far from being trivial. In order to understand the factors and barriers that can facilitate or hinder the application of biosensors in resource-limited settings, we analyze the context from several angles. First, the technology of the devices themselves has to be rethought to take into account the specific needs and the available means of these countries. For this, we describe the partition of a biosensor into its functional shells, which define the information flow from the analyte to the end-user, and by following this partition we assess the strengths and weaknesses of biosensing devices in view of their specific technological development and challenging deployment in low-resource environments. Then, we discuss the problem of cost reduction by pointing out transversal factors, such as throughput and cost of mistreatment, that need to be re-considered when analyzing the cost-effectiveness of biosensing devices. Beyond the technical landscape, the compliance with regulations is also a major aspect that is described with its link to the validation of the devices and to the acceptance from the local medical personnel. Finally, to learn from a successful case, we analyze a breakthrough inexpensive biosensor that is showing high potential with respect to many of the described aspects. We conclude by mentioning both some transversal benefits of deploying biosensors in developing countries, and the key factors that can drive such applications.","2018-11-29","2023-02-14 23:42:22","2023-02-14 23:42:22","2023-02-14 23:42:21","119","","4","8","","Biosensors","Assessing the Potential Deployment of Biosensors for Point-of-Care Diagnostics in Developing Countries","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this research is that of prototyping a customized prosthesis, with EMG signals that initiate the motion. The prosthesis’ fingers’ motions (as well as that of its hand and forearm parts) are driven by micro-motors, and assisted by the individualized command and control system. The software and hardware tandem concept of this mechatronic system enables complex motion (in the horizontal and vertical plane) with accurate trajectory and different set rules (gripping pressure, object temperature, acceleration towards the object). One important idea is regarding customization via reverse engineering techniques. Due to this, the dimensions and appearance (geometric characteristics) of the prosthesis would look like the human hand itself. The trajectories and motions of the fingers, thumbs, and joints have been studied by kinematic analysis with the matrix–vector method aided by Matlab. The concept and design of the mechanical parts allow for complex finger motion—rotational motion in two planes. The command and control system is embedded, and data received from the sensors are processed by a micro-controller for managing micro-motor control. Preliminary testing of the sensors and micro-motors on a small platform, Arduino, was performed. Prototyping of the mechanical components has been a challenge because of the high accuracy needed for the geometric precision of the parts. Several techniques of rapid prototyping were considered, but only DLP (digital light processing) proved to be the right one.","2021-03-30","2023-02-14 23:42:02","2023-02-14 23:42:02","2023-02-14 23:42:02","3077","","7","11","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Having 3D-printed soil samples will help academics and researchers conduct experiments in a reproducible and participatory research network and gain a better understanding of the studied soil parameters. One of the most important challenges in utilizing 3D printing techniques for soil modeling is the manufacturing of a soil structure. Until now, the most widespread method for printing porous soil structures is based on scanning a real sample via X-ray tomography. The aim of this paper is to design a porous soil structure based on mathematical models rather than on samples themselves. This can allow soil scientists to design and parameterize their samples according to their desired experiments. An open-source toolchain is developed using a Lua script, in the IceSL slicer, with graphical user interface to enable researchers to create and configure their digital soil models, called monoliths, without using meshing algorithms or STL files which reduce the resolution of the model. Examples of monoliths are 3D-printed in polylactic acid using fused filament fabrication technology with a layer thickness of 0.20, 0.12, and 0.08 mm. The images generated from the digital model slicing are analyzed using open-source ImageJ software to obtain information about internal geometrical shape, porosity, tortuosity, grain size distribution, and hydraulic conductivities. The results show that the developed script enables designing reproducible numerical models that imitate soil structures with defined pore and grain sizes in a range between coarse sand (from 1 mm diameter) to fine gravel (up to 12 mm diameter).","2021-09-15","2023-02-14 23:41:54","2023-02-14 23:41:54","2023-02-14 23:41:54","67","","3","9","","Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drone was equipped with ultrawideband (UWB) transceiver modules, which can be used for communication, as well as distance measurement. The location of the drone was detected based on fixed anchor points using a single type of UWB transceiver. Our aim is to create a swarm localization system that enables drones to switch their role between an active swarm member and an anchor node to enhance the localization of the whole swarm. To this end, this paper presents our current baseline localization system and its performance regarding single-drone localization with fixed anchors and its integration into our current modular quadcopters, which was designed to be easily extendable to a swarm localization system. The distance between each drone and the anchors was measured periodically, and a specially tailored gradient descent algorithm was used to solve the resulting nonlinear optimization problem. Additional copter and wireless-specific adaptations were performed to enhance the robustness. The system was tested with a Vicon system as a position reference and showed a high precision of 0.2 m with an update rate of <10 Hz. Additionally, the system was integrated into the FINken copters of the SwarmLab and evaluated in multiple outdoor scenarios.

The rise of distributed digital manufacturing provides an opportunity for much more rapid lateral scaling of open source appropriate technologies for agriculture. However, the most mature distributed manufacturing area is plastic, which has limited use for many OSA applications. To overcome this limitation with design, this study reports on of a completely 3D-printable planetary roller screw linear actuator. The device is designed as a parametric script-based computer aided design (CAD) package to allow for the easy adaption for a number of applications such as food processing at different scales. The planetary roller screw is fabricated in dishwasher-safe polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) on an open source machine and tested using an open source testing platform to determine if it could maintain a constant load without slipping and the maximum force. Then, this output is compared to a direct screw press using the same materials. The results found that the maximum force is more than doubled for the roller screw actuator using the same materials, making them adequate for some food processing techniques.

The present work evolved from a Field Programmable Gate Array– (FPGA) based design to simulate urban growth into a generic architecture that is automatically generated by a framework to efficiently compute complex cellular automata with large 29 × 29 neighborhoods in Cartesian or toroidal grids, with 16 or 256 states per cell. The new architecture and the framework are presented in detail, including results in terms of modeling capabilities and performance. Large neighborhoods greatly enhance CA modeling capabilities, such as the implementation of anisotropic rules. Performance-wise, the proposed architecture runs on a medium-size FPGA up to 51 times faster vs. a CPU running highly optimized C code. Compared to GPUs the speedup is harder to quantify, because CA results have been reported on GPU implementations with neighborhoods up to 11 × 11, in which case FPGA performance is roughly on par with GPU; however, based on published GPU trends, for 29 × 29 neighborhoods the proposed architecture is expected to have better performance vs. a GPU, at one-10th the energy requirements.

If equipped with optical sensors, orthophotos with very high spatial resolution can be retrieved using photogrammetric processing. The use of these images in multi-temporal analysis and the combination with spatial data imposes high demands on their spatial accuracy. This georeferencing accuracy of UAS orthomosaics is generally expressed as the checkpoint error. However, the checkpoint error alone gives no information about the reproducibility of the photogrammetrical compilation of orthomosaics. This study optimizes the geolocation of UAS orthomosaics time series and evaluates their reproducibility. A correlation analysis of repeatedly computed orthomosaics with identical parameters revealed a reproducibility of 99% in a grassland and 75% in a forest area. Between time steps, the corresponding positional errors of digitized objects lie between 0.07 m in the grassland and 0.3 m in the forest canopy. The novel methods were integrated into a processing workflow to enhance the traceability and increase the quality of UAS remote sensing.","2020-11-22","2023-02-14 23:41:30","2023-02-14 23:41:30","2023-02-14 23:41:30","3831","","22","12","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, synthesis, and software exploration which support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this paper we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from 1 core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor and framework. OpenPiton leverages the industry hardened OpenSPARC T1 core with modifications and builds upon it with a scratch-built, scalable uncore creating a flexible, modern manycore design. In addition, OpenPiton provides synthesis and backend scripts for ASIC and FPGA to enable other researchers to bring their designs to implementation. OpenPiton provides a complete verification infrastructure of over 8000 tests, is supported by mature software tools, runs full-stack multiuser Debian Linux, and is written in industry standard Verilog. Multiple implementations of OpenPiton have been created including a taped-out 25-core implementation in IBM's 32nm process and multiple Xilinx FPGA prototypes.","2016-06-09","2023-02-14 23:41:14","2023-05-08 15:13:08","2023-02-14 23:41:13","217-232","","4","51","","SIGPLAN Not.","OpenPiton","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","bronze","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Application performance requiring rapid real-time network provisioning, optimized traffic management, and virtualization of shared resources has induced the conceptualization and adoption of new networking models. Software defined networking (SDN), one of the predominant and relatively new networking paradigms, seeks to simplify network management by decoupling network control logic from the underlying hardware and introduces real-time network programmability enabling innovation. The present work reviews the state of the art in software defined networking providing a historical perspective on complementary technologies in network programmability and the inherent shortcomings which paved the way for SDN. The SDN architecture is discussed along with popular protocols, platforms, and existing simulation and debugging solutions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is presented around recent SDN development and deployment avenues ranging from mobile communications and data centers to campus networks and residential environments. The review concludes by highlighting implementation challenges and subsequent research directions being pursued in academia and industry to address issues related to application performance, control plane scalability and design, security, and interdomain connectivity in the context of SDN.","2017","2023-02-14 23:40:50","2023-02-14 23:40:50","2023-02-14 23:40:49","1-35","","","2017","","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The library comprises a set of cores that were chosen, together with their parameters and interfacing schemas, based on recommendations from industry and academic SDR experts. The operation of the SDR cores is first validated and then benchmarked against two other cores libraries of a similar type to show that our cores do not take much more logic elements than existing cores and that they support a comparable maximum clock speed. Finally, we propose our design for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and supporting tool-flow, which we are in the process of building using our SDR library and the Delite DSL framework. We intend to take this DSL and supporting framework further to provide a rapid prototyping system for SDR application development to programmers not experienced in HDL coding.

Increasing extreme precipitation events will likely lead to greater human and economic losses unless reliable and efficient early warning systems (EWS) along with other adaptation actions are put in place in urban areas. The challenge is in the integration and analysis in time and space of the environmental, meteorological, and territorial data from multiple sources needed to build up EWS able to provide efficient contribution to increase the resilience of vulnerable and exposed urban communities to flooding. Efficient EWS contribute to the preparedness phase of the disaster cycle but could also be relevant in the planning of the emergency phase. The RainBO Life project addressed this matter, focusing on the improvement of knowledge, methods, and tools for the monitoring and forecast of extreme precipitation events and the assessment of the associated flood risk for small and medium watercourses in urban areas. To put this into practice, RainBO developed a webGIS platform, which contributes to the “planning” of the management of river flood events through the use of detailed data and flood risk/vulnerability maps, and the “event management” with real-time monitoring/forecast of the events through the collection of observed data from real sensors, estimated/forecasted data from hydrologic models as well as qualitative data collected through a crowdsourcing app.","2019-12-17","2023-02-14 23:40:27","2023-02-14 23:40:27","2023-02-14 23:40:27","145","","12","7","","Climate","The RainBO Platform for Enhancing Urban Resilience to Floods","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main difficulty for water collection and analysis is the logistics of the process, since the collections are often made by mall boats in very distant aquifers, applying manual processes, and are sometimes based on few samples. In this paper, the development, construction, and implementation of a robotic airboat to measure water quality in lakes has been described. The airboat was developed in the form of a mini-boat, in a fiberglass structure, whose interior housed a battery, a Raspberry Pi mini-computer, a Wi-Fi router for connection to a notebook, tablet or cell phone, and sensors connected to the Arduino platform. The airboat was validated in two lagoons in Fortaleza, and in a reservoir in the city of Pacatuba. The results were collected with the purpose of analyzing the parameters of each lagoon. The main contribution of this work was the development of an autonomous system of acquiring water parameters from several points of the lagoon.","2019-03-07","2023-02-14 23:40:24","2023-02-14 23:40:24","2023-02-14 23:40:24","19","","1","8","","Robotics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments.

The solution is based on the designed prototype of the smart shirt equipped with a processor, wearable sensors, power supply and telemedical interface. The data derived from wearable sensors were used to create feature vector that consisted of the estimation of the user-specific relative intensity and the variance of filtered accelerometer data. The method was validated using an experimental protocol which was designed to be safe for the elderly and was based on clinically validated short physical performance battery (SPPB) test tasks. To obtain the recognition model six classifiers were examined and compared including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Binary Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks. The classification models were able to identify the sedentary behavior with an accuracy of 95.00% ± 2.11%. Experimental results suggested that high accuracy can be obtained by estimating sedentary behavior pattern using the smart shirt and machine learning approach.

The current generation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensors suffers from various technical problems. This study explores the added value of calibration models based on (multiple) linear regression including cross terms on the performance of an electrochemical NO2 sensor, the B43F manufactured by Alphasense. Sensor data were collected in duplicate at four reference sites in the Netherlands over a period of one year. It is shown that a calibration, using O3 and temperature in addition to a reference NO2 measurement, improves the prediction in terms of R2 from less than 0.5 to 0.69–0.84. The uncertainty of the calibrated sensors meets the Data Quality Objective for indicative methods specified by the EU directive in some cases and it was verified that the sensor signal itself remains an important predictor in the multilinear regressions. In practice, these sensors are likely to be calibrated over a period (much) shorter than one year.

It is critical to ensure the security of information transferred, processed, and stored throughout digital channels. Among this information, digital images draw attention in terms of frequency of use in digital channels. In this study, a new image encryption algorithm is proposed to address the security problems of digital images. The aspect that differentiates the proposed algorithm from thousands of image encryption algorithms in the literature is that it is designed within the framework of the provable security design principle. The provable security design approach has ensured that the proposed algorithm is theoretically secure with mathematical proof techniques. In addition to addressing the proposed architecture security concerns, the hybrid random number generator used as the key generator constitutes another unique aspect. This generator, which was designed using chaotic systems, physical unclonable functions, and optimization algorithms, stands out as the innovative aspect of the study. The statistical randomness properties of the proposed random number generator were tested using the NIST SP 800-22 Statistical Test Suite. Successful results were obtained for 15 tests in the test package. In addition, the success of these outputs was tested on a new image encryption algorithm. The security of the proposed algorithm was tested from different angles using various experimental analyzes and a 12-step provable security analysis roadmap. Successful analysis results and performance measurements indicate that the proposed cryptographic components can be used in many information security applications and many future designs.","2021-05-08","2023-02-14 23:39:21","2023-02-14 23:39:21","2023-02-14 23:39:21","824","","5","13","","Symmetry","SIEA","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to their outstanding computational capabilities, ANNs have become appealing solutions for safety-critical systems as well. Frequently, they are considered intrinsically robust and fault tolerant for being brain-inspired and redundant computing models. However, when ANNs are deployed on resource-constrained hardware devices, single physical faults may compromise the activity of multiple neurons. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the reliability of the entire neural computing system, including both the software and the hardware components. This article systematically addresses reliability concerns for ANNs running on multiprocessor system-on-a-chips (MPSoCs). It presents a methodology to assign resilience scores to individual neurons and, based on that, schedule the workload of an ANN on the target MPSoC so that critical neurons are neatly distributed among the available processing elements. This reliability-oriented methodology exploits an integer linear programming solver to find the optimal solution. Experimental results are given for three different convolutional neural networks trained on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. We carried out a comprehensive assessment on an open-source artificial intelligence-based RISC-V MPSoC. The results show the reliability improvements of the proposed methodology against the traditional scheduling.","2021-07-13","2023-02-14 23:39:19","2023-02-14 23:39:19","2023-02-14 23:39:18","6455","","14","11","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","green","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the resource constraint barrier for secure and reliable data transmission on the widely used IoT devices such as wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes, many researcher studies consider hardware acceleration of traditional cryptographic algorithms as one of the effective methods. Meanwhile, as one of the current research topics in the reduced instruction set computer (RISC), RISC-V provides a solid foundation for implementing domain-specific architecture (DSA). To this end, we propose an extended instruction scheme for the advanced encryption standard (AES) based on RISC-V custom instructions and present a coprocessor designed on the open-source core Hummingbird E203. The AES coprocessor uses direct memory access channels to achieve parallel data access and processing, which provides flexibility in memory space allocation and improves the efficiency of cryptographic components. Applications with embedded AES custom instructions running on an experimental prototype of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform demonstrated a 25.3% to 37.9% improvement in running time over previous similar works when processing no less than 80 bytes of data. In addition, the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) experiments show that in most cases, the coprocessor only consumes up to 20% more power than the necessary AES operations.","2021-12-30","2023-02-14 23:39:16","2023-02-14 23:39:16","2023-02-14 23:39:15","1-13","","","2021","","Security and Communication Networks","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","Jan, Mian Ahmad","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, the detailed nonlinear mathematical model is established, and the parameters are acquired from designed experiments and numerical analyses. For control design purposes, the dynamics equation is linearized around the hovering equilibrium point, and a control allocation method based on trim calculation is developed. To deal with the actuator saturation and uncertain disturbance problems for the novel TRUAV, an improved flight control law based on the combination of the robust servo linear quadratic regulator (RSLQR) optimal control and the extended state observer (ESO) is proposed. The designed flight control law has a simple structure with a high reliability in engineering.

Several centers are developing reusable stop-gap respirators as alternatives to disposable N95 respirators during public health emergencies, using techniques such as 3D-printing, silicone moulding and plastic extrusion. Effective sealing of the mask, combined with respiratory filters should achieve 95% or greater filtration of particles less than 1um. Quantitative fit-testing (QNFT) data from these stop-gap devices has not been published to date. Our team developed one such device, the “SSM”, and evaluated it using QNFT.                                            Methods                Device prototypes were iteratively evaluated for comfort, breathability and communication, by team members wearing them for 15-30min. The fit and seal were assessed by positive and negative pressure user seal checks. The final design was then formally tested by QNFT, according to CSA standard Z94.4–18 in 40 volunteer healthcare providers. An overall fit-factor >100 is the passing threshold. Volunteers were also tested by QNFT on disposable N95 masks which had passed qualitative fit testing (QLFT) by institutional Occupational Health and Safety Department.                                            Results                The SSM scored 3.5/5 and 4/5 for comfort and breathability. The median overall harmonic mean fit-factors of disposable N95 and SSM were 137.9 and 6316.7 respectively. SSM scored significantly higher than disposable respirators in fit-test runs and overall fit-factors (p <0.0001). Overall passing rates in disposable and SSM respirators on QNFT were 65% and 100%. During dynamic runs, passing rates in disposable and SSM respirators were 68.1% and 99.4%; harmonic means were 73.7 and 1643.                                            Conclusions                We present the design and validation of a reusable N95 stop-gap filtering facepiece respirator that can match existent commercial respirators.

Despite the fact that crowdsensing approaches could be an adequate solution for urban areas, they cannot be implemented in rural environments. Instead, deploying a fleet of UAVs could be considered an acceptable alternative. Embracing this approach, this paper proposes the use of UAVs equipped with off-the-shelf sensors to perform air pollution monitoring tasks. These UAVs are guided by our proposed Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC) algorithm, which is based on a chemotaxis metaheuristic and a local particle swarm optimization strategy. Together, they allow automatically performing the monitoring of a specified area using UAVs. Experimental results show that, when using PdUC, an implicit priority guides the construction of pollution maps by focusing on areas where the pollutants’ concentration is higher. This way, accurate maps can be constructed in a faster manner when compared to other strategies. The PdUC scheme is compared against various standard mobility models through simulation, showing that it achieves better performance. In particular, it is able to find the most polluted areas with more accuracy and provides a higher coverage within the time bounds defined by the UAV flight time.","2017","2023-02-14 23:38:22","2023-02-14 23:38:22","2023-02-14 23:38:21","1-14","","","2017","","Journal of Advanced Transportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These systems perform automatically this task by regulating the injected air according to the actual indoor CO                2                concentration. Several control approaches have been implemented and deployed in real-setting scenarios, but most of them are either time-triggered or based on fixed threshold values. In this paper, we introduce a platform that integrates recent advanced Internet of Things and big-data technologies for context-driven monitoring and control of ventilation systems. The aim is to gather, process and extract contextual data, mainly indoor/outdoor CO                2                concentration, to be used for maintaining a suitable ventilation rate that balances between energy consumption and occupants’ well-being. A prototype was developed and deployed for conducting experiments of different ventilation control approaches. We have developed two control approaches, ON/OFF and proportional–integral–derivative control, and compared them with the proposed state-feedback control approach. Experiments have been conducted in our Energy-Efficient Building Laboratory to evaluate these approaches in terms of the indoor CO                2                concentration, the ventilation rates, and the power consumption.

On the basis of this situation, this paper analyses the current state-of-the-art of wireless multimedia sensor networks, identifying the limitations and needs of these solutions. In this sense, in order to improve the trade-off between autonomous and computational capabilities, this paper proposes a heterogeneous multiprocessor sensor platform, consisting of an ultra-low power microcontroller and a high-performance processor, which transfers control between processors as needed. This architecture allows the shutdown of idle systems and fail-safe remote reprogramming. The sensor equipment can be adapted to the needs of the project. The deployed equipment incorporates, in addition to environmental meteorological variables, a microphone input and two cameras (visible and thermal) to capture multimedia data.

Addressing these challenges, Blossom aims at three design objectives: accessibility, flexibility, and expressiveness. The robot’s mechanism can be quickly assembled and partially extended by end-users. Blossom’s appearance is open-ended through handcrafted fabric exteriors created and customized by users. Smooth organic movements are achieved with tensile mechanisms, elastic components, and a soft exterior cover attached loosely to the body.

The application of traditional bird repelling methods such as bird cannons and tree netting become inefficient in the long run, requiring high maintenance and reducing mobility. Due to their versatility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be beneficial to solve this problem. However, due to their low battery capacity that equals low flight duration, it is necessary to evolve path planning optimization. A novel path planning optimization algorithm of UAVs based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. This path planning optimization algorithm aims to manage the drone’s distance and flight time, applying optimization and randomness techniques to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional systems. The proposed algorithm’s performance was tested in three study cases: two of them in simulation to test the variation of each parameter and one in the field to test the influence on battery management and height influence. All cases were tested in the three possible situations: same incidence rate, different rates, and different rates with no bird damage to fruit crops. The field tests were also essential to understand the algorithm’s behavior of the path planning algorithm in the UAV, showing that there is less efficiency with fewer points of interest, but this does not correlate with the flight time. In addition, there is no association between the maximum horizontal speed and the flight time, which means that the function to calculate the total distance for path planning needs to be adjusted. Thus, the proposed algorithm presents promising results with an outstanding reduced average error in the total distance for the path planning obtained and low execution time, being suited for this and other applications.","2021-12-28","2023-02-14 23:37:49","2023-02-14 23:37:49","2023-02-14 23:37:48","62","","1","10","","Processes","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper discusses the use of aerial drones as a platform for deploying a gunshot surveillance system based on an array of microphones. Notwithstanding the difficulties associated with the inherent additive noise from the rotating propellers, this application brings an important advantage: the possibility of estimating the shooter position solely based on the muzzle blast sound, with the support of a digital map of the terrain. This work focuses on direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods applied to audio signals obtained from a microphone array aboard a flying drone. We investigate preprocessing and different DoA estimation techniques in order to obtain the setup that performs better for the application at hand. We use a combination of simulated and actual gunshot signals recorded using a microphone array mounted on a UAV. One of the key insights resulting from the field recordings is the importance of drone positioning, whereby all gunshots recorded in a region outside a cone open from the gun muzzle presented a hit rate close to 96%. Based on experimental results, we claim that reliable bearing estimates can be achieved using a microphone array mounted on a drone.","2019-10-01","2023-02-14 23:47:08","2023-02-14 23:47:08","2023-02-14 23:47:07","4271","","19","19","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Actuators driving an omnidirectional mobile robot are connected in a line topology which requires synchronization to move simultaneously in translation and rotation. We employ EtherCAT, a real-time Ethernet network, to control servo controllers for the mobile robot. The first part of this study focuses on the design of a low-cost embedded system utilizing an open-source EtherCAT master. Although satisfying real-time constraints is critical, a desired trajectory on the center of the mobile robot should be decomposed into the joint space to drive the servo controllers. For the center of the robot, a convolution-based path planner and a corresponding joint space control algorithm are presented considering its physical limits. To avoid obstacles that introduce geometric constraints on the curved path, a trajectory generation algorithm considering high curvature turning points is adapted for an omnidirectional mobile robot. Tracking a high curvature path increases mathematical complexity, which requires precise synchronization between the actuators of the mobile robot. An improvement of the distributed clock—the synchronization mechanism of EtherCAT for slaves—is presented and applied to the joint controllers of the mobile robot. The local time of the EtherCAT master is dynamically adjusted according to the drift of the reference slave, which minimizes the synchronization error between each joint. Experiments are conducted on our own developed four-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot.

Robots can be used with different purposes, from being simple tools to be programmed with some specific behaviour, to being peers with whom to engage in a fruitful interaction for a collaborative learning purpose. In this sense, they can also foster learning of transversal skills such as communication and cooperation. In this article, we propose robot swarms as a novel educational tool to target exactly those transversal skills that are difficult to account otherwise. The usage of multiple robots interacting to solve a common problem can support the learning of concepts related to cooperation and collective actions and can make accessible notions about complex systems that are common in physical, biological, economic and social sciences. Additionally, the possibility to interact and participate in the collective behaviour displayed by the robot swarm can strongly increase the comprehension and engagement with the proposed concept. Motivated by this picture, we propose a roadmap for the utilization of swarm robotics for educational purposes, which is hinged on the Thymio robot, a simple but powerful educational robot that presents all the features required for swarm robotics experimentation. We propose two case studies and we substantiate the proposal with preliminary results from a demonstration of robot swarms performed during a recent robotics festival.","2019-01-01","2023-02-14 23:47:02","2023-02-14 23:47:02","2023-02-14 23:47:02","172988141882518","","1","16","","International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems","Robot swarms as an educational tool","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, the main characteristics with respect to existing platforms are highlighted in aspects such as: system autonomy, cost, safety level, operation ranges, experimental flexibility, among others. The possible controller design approaches for quadcopter stabilization can extend to many basic and advanced techniques. In this work, to show the operation and didactic use of the platform, the development of the controller for tilt angle stabilization under two different approaches are presented. The first approach is through PID control, oriented for undergraduate students with basic level in control theory.

In this framework, geographic information, and spatial data and tools such as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and multispectral optical sensors play a crucial role in the geomatics as support techniques. PA needs software to store and process spatial data and the Free and Open Software System (FOSS) community kept pace with PA’s needs: several FOSS software tools have been developed for data gathering, analysis, and restitution. The adoption of FOSS solutions, WebGIS platforms, open databases, and spatial data infrastructure to process and store spatial and nonspatial acquired data helps to share information among different actors with user-friendly solutions. Nevertheless, a comprehensive open-source platform that, besides processing UAV data, allows directly storing, visualising, sharing, and querying the final results and the related information does not exist. Indeed, today, the PA’s data elaboration and management with a FOSS approach still require several different software tools. Moreover, although some commercial solutions presented platforms to support management in PA activities, none of these present a complete workflow including data from acquisition phase to processed and stored information. In this scenario, the paper aims to provide UAV and PA users with a FOSS-replicable methodology that can fit farming activities’ operational and management needs. Therefore, this work focuses on developing a totally FOSS workflow to visualise, process, analyse, and manage PA data. In detail, a multidisciplinary approach is adopted for creating an operative web-sharing tool able to manage Very High Resolution (VHR) agricultural multispectral-derived information gathered by UAV systems. A vineyard in Northern Italy is used as an example to show the workflow of data generation and the data structure of the web tool. A UAV survey was carried out using a six-band multispectral camera and the data were elaborated through the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique, resulting in 3 cm resolution orthophoto. A supervised classifier identified the phenological stage of under-row weeds and the rows with a 95% overall accuracy. Then, a set of GIS-developed algorithms allowed Individual Tree Detection (ITD) and spectral indices for monitoring the plant-based phytosanitary conditions. A spatial data structure was implemented to gather the data at canopy scale. The last step of the workflow concerned publishing data in an interactive 3D webGIS, allowing users to update the spatial database. The webGIS can be operated from web browsers and desktop GIS. The final result is a shared open platform obtained with nonproprietary software that can store data of different sources and scales.","2021-04-07","2023-02-14 23:46:37","2023-02-14 23:46:37","2023-02-14 23:46:36","236","","4","10","","IJGI","Precision Agriculture Workflow, from Data Collection to Data Management Using FOSS Tools","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The general approach relies on technological determinism, whereby the discussion revolves around how and to what extent will ICT support development. It assumes the benefits of ICT as inherent. This approach ignores that ICT is created and experienced within a socially divisive and complex space. A more critical and sociological analysis is needed for development studies to better understand the implications of ICT initiatives. In this article, I argue that Saskia Sassen’s analytical framework of technology and society as embedded avoids this technological determinism and allows social theorists to account for social and material aspects of ICT. To support this alternative framework, I present a case study of a rural ICT initiative in Gujarat, India, and discuss how this re-conceptualization reveals more nuanced understanding of ICT and society. Based on interviews and field research, I find that technology creates new social understandings for the rural ICT users, but also that society shapes the technology to make it inaccessible for them.","2016-01","2023-02-14 23:46:15","2023-02-14 23:46:15","2023-02-14 23:46:14","107-118","","1","38","","Media, Culture & Society","Technology and society as embedded","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the necessary tools and knowledge for programming and configuring microcontrollers are not accessible to everyone. This article proposes a run-time deployment and management system through the Constrained Application Protocol that bridges the gap between end users and customizable environments. With our system, end users can incorporate new sensors or actuators in their installed microcontroller without having to access and program the microcontroller board. Rather, they can manage the resources of the Constrained Application Protocol servers through an accessible and transparent Web user interface.","2017-03","2023-02-14 23:45:55","2023-02-14 23:45:55","2023-02-14 23:45:55","155014771769896","","3","13","","International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, some barriers prevent equal access to this education. These obstacles include the lack of basic resources such as electricity and internet availability, which prevents appropriate training in the skills necessary for sustainable community development. Therefore, we have responded with the Solar-Powered Educational Learning Library (SolarSPELL) initiative, which offers a solar-powered digital library and provides an internet-like experience through its offline WiFi network. This educational innovation has been implemented in rural schools across the Pacific Islands, including in some of the more remote islands of Fiji, an area strongly affected by climate change. The objective of the study was to understand the impact of SolarSPELL on teaching and learning about climate change in the schools where it was implemented. This research used a case study method in which quantitative tools were applied to understand the characteristics of the schools and the impact of this educational innovation. The results showed that the SolarSPELL library was an impactful pedagogical resource in the schools where it was implemented. It served as support for teachers and motivated the students, promoted the democratization of knowledge in vulnerable areas, and provided appropriate educational resources to generate knowledge about problem-solving actions that can respond to climate change. The importance of this educational innovation lies in presenting strategies and best practices that help improve the quality of education, making it more inclusive and eliminating barriers to the acquisition of knowledge.","2020-08-17","2023-02-14 23:45:33","2023-02-14 23:45:33","2023-02-14 23:45:32","6636","","16","12","","Sustainability","SolarSPELL Assessment","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The developed Smelling Nano Aerial Vehicle (SNAV) is based on a lightweight commercial nano-quadcopter (27 g) equipped with a custom gas sensing board that can host up to two in situ metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors. Due to its small form-factor, the SNAV is not a hazard for humans, enabling its use in public areas or inside buildings. It can autonomously carry out gas sensing missions of hazardous environments inaccessible to terrestrial robots and bigger drones, for example searching for victims and hazardous gas leaks inside pockets that form within the wreckage of collapsed buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake or explosion. The first contribution of this work is assessing the impact of the nano-propellers on the MOX sensor signals at different distances to a gas source. A second contribution is adapting the ‘bout’ detection algorithm, proposed by Schmuker et al. (2016) to extract specific features from the derivative of the MOX sensor response, for real-time operation. The third and main contribution is the experimental validation of the SNAV for gas source localization (GSL) and mapping in a large indoor environment (160 m2) with a gas source placed in challenging positions for the drone, for example hidden in the ceiling of the room or inside a power outlet box. Two GSL strategies are compared, one based on the instantaneous gas sensor response and the other one based on the bout frequency. From the measurements collected (in motion) along a predefined sweeping path we built (in less than 3 min) a 3D map of the gas distribution and identified the most likely source location. Using the bout frequency yielded on average a higher localization accuracy than using the instantaneous gas sensor response (1.38 m versus 2.05 m error), however accurate tuning of an additional parameter (the noise threshold) is required in the former case. The main conclusion of this paper is that a nano-drone has the potential to perform gas sensing tasks in complex environments.","2019-01-24","2023-02-14 23:45:19","2023-02-14 23:45:19","2023-02-14 23:45:19","478","","3","19","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Globally, there are 36 million blind people, but less than half use white canes or more costly commercial sensory substitutions. The quality of life for visually impaired people is hampered by the resultant lack of independence. To help alleviate these challenges this study reports on the development of a low-cost, open-source ultrasound-based navigational support system in the form of a wearable bracelet to allow people with the lost vision to navigate, orient themselves in their surroundings and avoid obstacles when moving. The system can be largely made with digitally distributed manufacturing using low-cost 3-D printing/milling. It conveys point-distance information by utilizing the natural active sensing approach and modulates measurements into haptic feedback with various vibration patterns within the four-meter range. It does not require complex calibrations and training, consists of the small number of available and inexpensive components, and can be used as an independent addition to traditional tools. Sighted blindfolded participants successfully demonstrated the device for nine primary everyday navigation and guidance tasks including indoor and outdoor navigation and avoiding collisions with other pedestrians.","2019-08-31","2023-02-14 23:45:13","2023-02-14 23:45:13","2023-02-14 23:45:13","3783","","17","19","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spawning closures have been part of a suite of fishery management actions to rebuild the Gulf of Maine stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), but difficulties remain with managing rebuilding. The objective of this study was to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of cod spawning during winter in Massachusetts Bay to improve our understanding of cod spawning dynamics and inform fisheries management. Spawning was investigated in collaboration with commercial fishermen during three winter spawning seasons (October 2013–March 2016) using acoustic telemetry and passive acoustic monitoring equipment deployed in fixed-station arrays and mounted on mobile autonomous gliders. Tagged cod exhibited spawning site fidelity and spawning primarily occurred from early November through January with a mid-December peak and some inter-annual variability. The spatial distribution of spawning was generally consistent among years with multiple hotspots in areas &gt;50 m depth. Current closures encompass most of spawning, but important areas are recommended for potential modifications. Utilizing multiple complementary technologies and deployment strategies in collaboration with commercial fishermen enabled a comprehensive description of spawning and provides a valuable model for future studies.","2019-12-01","2023-02-14 23:45:08","2023-02-14 23:45:08","2023-02-14 23:45:08","1610-1625","","6","76","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","O'Driscoll, Richard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most systems are implemented following fragmented approaches for specific application domains, introducing difficulties in providing unified solutions. However, the unification of solutions is an important feature from an IoT perspective. In this paper, we present an IoT platform that supports multiple application layer communication protocols (Representational State Transfer (REST)/HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and Websockets) and that is composed of open-source frameworks (RabbitMQ, Ponte, OM2M, and RDF4J). We have explored a back-end system that interoperates with the various frameworks and offers a single approach for user-access control on IoT data streams and micro-services. The proposed platform is evaluated using its containerized version, being easily deployable on the vast majority of modern computing infrastructures. Its design promotes service reusability and follows a marketplace architecture, so that the creation of interoperable IoT ecosystems with active contributors is enabled. All the platform’s features are analyzed, and we discuss the results of experiments, with the multiple communication protocols being tested when used interchangeably for transferring data.

However, there is a lack of hardware and software support to effectively develop the potential of UASs in different remote sensing applications, such as the detection of radioactive sources. This paper presents the design, development and validation of a UAS for the detection of an uncontrolled and point radioactive source. The article describes a flexible and reusable software architecture for detecting the radioactive source (NaTcO     4    , containing       99 m     Tc) with a gamma-ray Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) spectrometer as a proof of concept. The UAS is equipped with multichannel air-ground communications to perform missions beyond line of sight and onboard computation to process samples in real time and thus react to any anomaly detected during the mission. An ad hoc ground control station (GCS) has also been developed for the correct interpretation of the radioactive samples taken by the UAS. Radiological spectra plots, contour mapping and waterfall plots are some of the elements used in the ad hoc GCS. The article shows the results obtained in a flight campaign performing different flights at different altitudes and speeds over the radiological source, demonstrating the viability of the system.","2018-10-30","2023-02-14 23:44:32","2023-02-14 23:44:32","2023-02-14 23:44:31","1712","","11","10","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One way of achieving synchronization involves marking distinct events with electrical pulses (event markers or “TTL pulses”), which are continuously recorded with research hardware, and can later be temporally aligned. Traditionally, this event marking was often performed using the parallel port in standard personal computers. However, the parallel port is disappearing from the landscape of computer hardware, being replaced by a serial (COM) port, namely the USB port. To find an adequate replacement for the parallel port, we evaluated four microcontroller units (MCUs) and the LabJack U3, an often-used USB data acquisition device, in terms of their latency and jitter for sending event markers in a simulated experiment on both Windows and Linux. Our results show that all four MCUs were comparable to the parallel port in terms of both latency and jitter, and consistently achieved latencies under 1 ms. With some caveats, the LabJack U3 can also achieve comparable latencies. In addition to the collected data, we share extensive documentation on how to build and use MCUs for event marking, including code examples. MCUs are a cost-effective, flexible, and performant replacement for the disappearing parallel port, enabling event marking and synchronization of data streams.","2021-04-14","2023-02-14 23:44:02","2023-02-14 23:44:02","2023-02-14 23:44:01","2450-2455","","6","53","","Behav Res","In COM we trust","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High solubility is therefore a key requirement for the development of protein-based reagents for applications in life sciences, biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Accurate solubility measurements, however, remain challenging and resource intensive, which limits their throughput and hence their applicability at the early stages of development pipelines, when long-lists of candidates are typically available in minute amounts. Here, we present an automated method based on the titration of a crowding agent (polyethylene glycol, PEG) to quantitatively assess relative solubility of proteins using about 200 µg of purified material. Our results demonstrate that this method is accurate and economical in material requirement and costs of reagents, which makes it suitable for high-throughput screening. This approach is freely-shared and based on a low cost, open-source liquid-handling robot. We anticipate that this method will facilitate the assessment of the developability of proteins and make it substantially more accessible.","2021-11-09","2023-02-14 23:43:59","2023-02-14 23:43:59","2023-02-14 23:43:59","21932","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large breweries implemented the use of sensors and digitization before smaller ones among which are craft breweries. Internet of Beer (IoB) technologies are becoming accessible to mid and small sized brewing companies. Therefore, the objective of this work is to review mainly low-cost IoB smart technologies that can be implemented from the mash to the final product and its service, to improve the brewing production, control, delivery, and final quality increasing profitability. The reviewed applications were retrieved both from the scientific databases and from the web. The work is structured in three macro areas such as beer processing, product logistics and traceability, and service. The results show a future trend characterized by a very fast increase in the use of IoB (also open source) systems to drive efficiency, productivity, quality, and safety. This will be done by real-time monitoring and a data-driven decision support system (DSS). Crucial aspects needing further investigation are data ownership and data standardization. The access price of IoB devices and software is destined for a significant decrease while their diversification on the market will grow leading to a massive future implementation within all the production levels.","2020-07-17","2023-02-14 23:43:15","2023-02-14 23:43:15","2023-02-14 23:43:15","950","","7","9","","Foods","Internet of Beer","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studying root system architecture and the dynamic changes that occur during a plant’s lifespan, especially for perennial crops growing over multiple growing seasons, is still a challenge because of the nature of their growing environment. We describe the utility of an imaging platform called RhizoVision Crown to study root system architecture of alfalfa, a perennial forage crop threatened by Phymatotrichopsis root rot (PRR) disease. Phymatotrichopsis omnivora is the causal agent of PRR disease that reduces alfalfa stand longevity. During the lifetime of the stand, PRR disease rings enlarge and the field can be categorized into three zones based upon plant status: asymptomatic, disease front and survivor. To study root system architectural changes associated with PRR, a 4-year-old 25.6-ha alfalfa stand infested with PRR was selected at the Red River Farm, Burneyville, OK during October 2017. Line transect sampling was conducted from four actively growing PRR disease rings. At each disease ring, six line transects were positioned spanning 15 m on either side of the disease front with one alfalfa root crown sampled at every 3 m interval. Each alfalfa root crown was imaged with the RhizoVision Crown platform using a backlight and a high-resolution monochrome CMOS camera enabling preservation of the natural root system integrity. The platform’s image analysis software, RhizoVision Analyzer, automatically segmented images, skeletonized, and extracted a suite of features. Data indicated that the survivor plants compensated for damage or loss to the taproot through the development of more lateral and crown roots, and that a suite of multivariate features could be used to automatically classify roots as from survivor or asymptomatic zones. Root growth is a dynamic process adapting to ever changing interactions among various phytobiome components. By utilizing the low-cost, efficient, and high-throughput RhizoVision Crown platform, we quantified these changes in a mature perennial forage crop.","2019-01","2023-02-14 23:42:52","2023-02-14 23:42:52","2023-02-14 23:42:51","102-111","","2","3","","Phytobiomes Journal","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work presents the design of efficient medical IoT sensor nodes (SNs) in terms of low-cost, low power-consumption, and increased data accuracy based on open-source platforms. The method utilizes a Sensor Controller (SC) within the IoT SN, which is capable of performing medical checks supporting a broad coverage of medical uses. A communication protocol has been developed for data and command exchange among SC, local gateways, and physicians’ or patients’ mobile devices (tablets, smart phones). The SC supports moving average window (MAW) and principle component analysis (PCA) filtering algorithms to capture data from the attached low-cost body sensors of different sampling profiles. Significant extensions in SN’s portability is achieved through energy consumption minimization based on the idle time gaps between sensors’ activations. SN’s components are either deactivated or set to low activity operation during these idle intervals. A medical case study is presented and the evaluated results show that the proposed SN can be incorporated into e-health platforms since it achieves comparable accuracy to its certified and high-cost commercial counterparts.","2019-02-02","2023-02-14 23:42:49","2023-02-14 23:42:49","2023-02-14 23:42:49","178","","2","8","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large aircraft with complex navigation systems rely on a variety of sensors including radio frequency aids and high performance inertial systems rendering them somewhat resistant to GPS denial. The rapid development of computer vision has seen cameras incorporated into small drones. Vision-based systems, consisting of one or more cameras, could arguably satisfy both size and weight constraints faced by UAVs. A new generation of thermal sensors is available that are lighter, smaller and widely available. Thermal sensors are a solution to enable navigation in difficult environments, including in low-light, dust or smoke. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review of thermal sensors integrated into navigation systems. Furthermore, the physics and characteristics of thermal sensors will also be presented to provide insight into challenges when integrating thermal sensors in place of conventional visual spectrum sensors.","2021-10-19","2023-02-14 23:57:25","2023-02-14 23:57:25","2023-02-14 23:57:25","217","","10","7","","J.

The chamber temperature was increased systematically over a wide range from −20      °C to 55      °C. A set of calibration curves was produced from the best fitting second-order polynomial curves for the offset in temperature between the sensor and reference. An improvement in accuracy of ±0.15      °C is with respect to the mentioned temperature range, compared to the significantly higher value reported of ±0.5      °C by the manufacturer for similar conditions.

However, the methods involved tend to be intrusive, which interfere with the consumers’ responses as they are more aware of the measurements. Furthermore, the existing methods to measure different ANS responses are not synchronized among them as they are measured independently. This paper discusses the development of an integrated camera system paired with an Android PC application to assess sensory evaluation and biometric responses simultaneously in the Cloud, such as heart rate, blood pressure, facial expressions, and skin-temperature changes using video and thermal images acquired by the integrated system and analyzed through computer vision algorithms written in Matlab®, and FaceReaderTM. All results can be analyzed through customized codes for multivariate data analysis, based on principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Data collected can be also used for machine-learning modeling based on biometrics as inputs and self-reported data as targets. Based on previous studies using this integrated camera and analysis system, it has shown to be a reliable, accurate, and convenient technique to complement the traditional sensory analysis of both food and nonfood products to obtain more information from consumers and/or trained panelists.","2018-09-05","2023-02-14 23:56:43","2023-02-14 23:56:43","2023-02-14 23:56:43","2958","","9","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CREDO program embraces testing known CR and CRE scenarios, and preparing to observe unexpected physics, it is also suitable for multi-messenger and multi-mission applications. Perfectly matched to CREDO capabilities, CRE could be formed both within classical models (e.g., as products of photon–photon interactions), and exotic scenarios (e.g., as results of decay of Super-Heavy Dark Matter particles). Their fronts might be significantly extended in space and time, and they might include cosmic rays of energies spanning the whole cosmic-ray energy spectrum, with a footprint composed of at least two extensive air showers with correlated arrival directions and arrival times. As the CRE are predominantly expected to be spread over large areas and, due to the expected wide energy range of the contributing particles, such a CRE detection might only be feasible when using all available cosmic-ray infrastructure collectively, i.e., as a globally extended network of detectors.

Nowadays, a large variety of reliable low-cost UAS sensors and controllers are available. However, contrary to ultralight aircrafts (ULAs), UASs have a too small operational range to efficiently cover large areas. Flight regulations prevailing in many countries further reduced this operational range; in particular, the “within visual line of sight” rule. This study presents a new system for image acquisition and high-quality photogrammetry of large scale areas (>10 km²). It was developed by upscaling the UAS paradigm, i.e., low-cost sensors and controllers, little (or no) on-board active stabilization, and adequate structure from motion photogrammetry, to an ULA platform. Because the system is low-cost (good quality-price ratio of UAS technologies), multi-sensors (large variety of available UAS sensors) and versatile (high ULA operational flexibility and more lenient regulation than for other platforms), the possible applications are numerous in miscellaneous research domains. The system was described in detail and illustrated from the flight and images acquisition to the photogrammetric routine. The system was successfully used to acquire high resolution and high quality RGB and multispectral images, and produced precisely georeferenced digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophotomosaics for a forested area of 1200 ha. The system can potentially carry any type of sensors. The system compatibility with any sensor can be tested, in terms of image quality and flight plan, with the proposed method. This study also highlighted a major technical limitation of the low-cost thermal infrared cameras: the too high integration time with respect to the flight speed of most UASs and ULAs. By providing the complete information required for reproducing the system, the authors seek to encourage its implementation in different geographical locations and scientific contexts, as well as, its combination with other sensors, in particular, laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral.","2020-04-16","2023-02-14 23:56:33","2023-02-14 23:56:33","2023-02-14 23:56:33","1265","","8","12","","Remote Sensing","Upscaling UAS Paradigm to UltraLight Aircrafts","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these protocols is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which controls the transmission bit rate in function of network congestion. Nevertheless, in wireless communications, there appear problems such as noise and interference, for which TCP was not designed. Based on these problems, there exist some methods trying to mitigate congestion, such as explicit loss notifications and the use of end-to-end codification. The aim of this work was to propose a wireless TCP protocol improvement, considering a negative acknowledgment (NACK), which allows to differentiate between losses due to congestion and losses due to wireless channel issues. NACK employs a small protocol packet and produces improvement in the quality of service metrics. The experiments were carried out in in-door and out-door environments, over an online video game scenario, and over a long-distance wireless link between two islands. The average results show a 25-percent delay improvement and a 5-percent jitter improvement when compared to the original TCP Reno protocol, while for throughput a 90-percent improvement was achieved for distances between 100 and 414 m.","2020-06-09","2023-02-14 23:56:28","2023-02-14 23:56:28","2023-02-14 23:56:27","101","","6","12","","Future Internet","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More than 10 million affected cases and more than half a million deaths have been reported so far, while no vaccine is yet available as a treatment. Considering the global healthcare urgency, several techniques, including whole genome sequencing and computed tomography imaging have been employed for diagnosing infected people. Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission. Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces with which people may come in contact. Detection based on non-contact optical techniques is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus, and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces. Nanomaterial-based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection. Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions, this manuscript critically reviews recent literature to specifically illustrate nano-engineered effective and rapid solutions. In addition, all the different techniques are critically analyzed, compared, and contrasted to identify the most promising methods. Moreover, promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations, via color change and light-sensitive nanostructures, to assist fingerprint techniques (to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase) are also presented.","2020-07-20","2023-02-14 23:56:25","2023-02-14 23:56:25","2023-02-14 23:56:24","5126","","14","21","","IJMS","Point-of-Use Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to present the development of an energy harvesting floor—called Genpath—using a rotational electromagnetic (EM) technique to generate electricity from human footsteps. The dynamic models of the electro-mechanical systems were developed using MATLAB®/Simulink to predict the energy performances of Genpath and help fine-tune the design parameters. The system in Genpath comprises two main parts: the EM generator and the Power Management and Storage (PMS) circuit. For the EM generator, the conversion mechanism for linear translation to rotation was designed by using the rack-pinion and lead-screw mechanism. Based on the simulation analysis, the averaged energy of the lead-screw model is greater than that of the rack-pinion model. Thus, prototype-II of Genpath with 12-V-DC generator, lead-screw mechanism was recently built. It shows better performance when compared to the previous prototype-I of Genpath with 24-V-DC-generator, rack-pinion mechanism. Both prototypes have an allowable displacement of 15 mm. The Genpath prototype-II produces an average energy of up to 702 mJ (or average power of 520 mW) per footstep. The energy provided by Genpath prototype-II is increased by approximately 184% when compared to that of the prototype-I. The efficiency of the EM-generator system is ~26% based on the 2-W power generation from the heel strike of a human’s walk in one step. Then, the PMS circuit was developed to harvest energy into the batteries and to supply the other part to specific loads. The experiment showed that the designed PMS circuit has the overall efficiency of 74.72%. The benefit of the design system is for a lot of applications, such as a wireless sensor and Internet of Thing applications.","2020-10-16","2023-02-14 23:56:19","2023-02-14 23:56:19","2023-02-14 23:56:19","5419","","20","13","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TLS and DTLS play a crucial role in protecting daily Internet traffic, while 6TiSCH is a major low-power link layer technology for the IoT. In recent years, DTLS has been the de-facto security protocol to protect IoT application traffic, mainly because it runs over lightweight, unreliable transport protocols, i.e., UDP. However, unlike the DTLS record layer, the handshake requires reliable message delivery. It, therefore, incorporates sequence numbers, a retransmission timer, and a fragmentation algorithm. Our goal is to study how well these mechanisms perform, in the constrained setting of 6TiSCH, compared to TCP’s reliability algorithms, relied upon by TLS. We port the mbedTLS library to OpenWSN, a 6TiSCH reference implementation, and deploy the code on the state-of-the-art OpenMote platform. We show that, when the peers use an ideal channel, the DTLS handshake uses up to 800 less and completes 0.6 s faster. Nonetheless, using an unreliable communication link, the DTLS handshake duration suffers a performance penalty of roughly 45%, while TLS’ handshake duration degrades by merely 15%. Similarly, the number of exchanged bytes doubles for DTLS while for TLS the increase is limited to 15%. The results indicate that IoT product developers should account for network characteristics when selecting a security protocol. Neglecting to do so can negatively impact the battery lifetime of the entire constrained network.","2021-03-21","2023-02-14 23:56:04","2023-02-14 23:56:04","2023-02-14 23:56:03","2192","","6","21","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the spread of makerspaces like fabrication laboratories (FabLabs) around the world, the use of digital fabrication tools for prototyping in educational institutes is becoming increasingly common. Studies on the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of digital fabrication have been carried out.

To bridge this research gap, a conceptual framework for sustainable prototyping based on a five-stage design thinking model is proposed. The framework, which is based on a comprehensive literature review of social, economic, and environmental sustainability factors of digital fabrication, is applied to evaluate a prototyping process that took place in a FabLab in an education context aimed at enhancing sustainability.

Two enabling technologies are proposed here: a planning strategy based on a common-sense reasoning approach for service composition and a virtual-network protocol for Inter-Domain Messaging. The planner will identify the services that, properly connected, will cater for arisen, and therefore, unexpected needs. The virtual-network protocol will provide the support for this interconnection to take place in a transparent and orthogonal manner.

The study is aimed at verifying the possibility of implementing PQ monitoring in distribution networks without replacing existing smart metering devices or adding new modules for PQ measurements, thus zeroing the installation costs. To this aim, an electronic board, currently used for remote energy metering, was chosen as a case study, specifically the STCOMET platform. Starting from the specifications of this device, the possibility of implementing power quality metrics is investigated in order to verify if compliance with standard requirements for PQ instruments can be obtained. Issues related to device features constraints are discussed; possible solutions and correction algorithms are presented and experimentally verified for different PQ metrics with a particular focus on harmonic analysis. The feasibility study takes into account both the use of on-board voltage and current transducers for low voltage applications and also the impact of external instrument transformers on measurement results.","2020-11-07","2023-02-14 23:55:29","2023-02-14 23:55:29","2023-02-14 23:55:29","6361","","21","20","","Sensors","PQ and Harmonic Assessment Issues on Low-Cost Smart Metering Platforms","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was carried out in the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super-Site, Costa Rica, in June 2016. The triangle method was used to derive    λ   E from the UAV imagery and the results were compared to    λ   E measurements of an eddy covariance system within the coincident eddy flux tower footprint. The tower footprint was derived using a two-dimensional parameterization model for flux footprint prediction. The comparisons with the flux tower measurements showed a mean relative difference of 10.98% with a slight overestimation of the UAV-based flux retrievals by nearly 7.7 Wm      − 2     . The results are in good agreement with satellite-based retrievals, as provided by the literature, for which the triangle method was initially developed and mostly used so far. This study proved to be a promising approach for transferring the triangle method to UAV imagery in ecosystems such as tropical dry forests. With the presented approach, new details in spatially distributed latent heat flux estimates at ultra-high resolution are now possible, thereby potentially closing the gap in spatial resolution between satellites and flux towers. Even more, it allows tracing the latent heat flux from single trees at leaf level. Besides, this approach also opens new perspectives for the monitoring of latent heat fluxes in tropical dry forests.","2020-05-26","2023-02-14 23:55:10","2023-02-14 23:55:10","2023-02-14 23:55:09","604","","6","11","","Forests","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, in the majority of investigations, melanins are either chemically synthesized or extracted from animals, which presents significant challenges for large-scale production. Bacteria have been used as biocatalysts to synthesize a variety of biomaterials due to their fast growth and amenability to genetic engineering using synthetic biology tools. In this study, we engineered the extremely fast-growing bacterium                V. natriegens                to synthesize melanin nanoparticles by expressing a heterologous tyrosinase gene with inducible promoters. Characterization of the melanin produced from                V. natriegens                -produced tyrosinase revealed that it exhibited physical and chemical properties similar to those of natural and chemically synthesized melanins, including nanoparticle structure, protection against UV damage, and adsorption of toxic compounds. We anticipate that producing and controlling melanin structures at the nanoscale in this bacterial system with synthetic biology tools will enable the design and rapid production of novel biomaterials for multiple applications.                          ,               ABSTRACT                              Melanin is a pigment produced by organisms throughout all domains of life. Due to its unique physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and biostability, there has been an increasing interest in the use of melanin for broad applications. In the vast majority of studies, melanin has been either chemically synthesized or isolated from animals, which has restricted its use to small-scale applications. Using bacteria as biocatalysts is a promising and economical alternative for the large-scale production of biomaterials. In this study, we engineered the marine bacterium                Vibrio natriegens                , one of the fastest-growing organisms, to synthesize melanin by expressing a heterologous tyrosinase gene and demonstrated that melanin production was much faster than in previously reported heterologous systems. The melanin of                V. natriegens                was characterized as a polymer derived from dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and, similarly to synthetic melanin, exhibited several characteristic and useful features. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that melanin produced from                V. natriegens                formed nanoparticles that were assembled as “melanin ghost” structures, and the photoprotective properties of these particles were validated by their protection of cells from UV irradiation. Using a novel electrochemical reverse engineering method, we observed that melanization conferred redox activity to                V. natriegens                . Moreover, melanized bacteria were able to quickly adsorb the organic compound trinitrotoluene (TNT). Overall, the genetic tractability, rapid division time, and ease of culture provide a set of attractive properties that compare favorably to current                E. coli                production strains and warrant the further development of this chassis as a microbial factory for natural product biosynthesis.

Many imaging algorithms have been proposed, which seek to improve the quality of the reconstructed microwave image to enhance the potential clinical decision. However, in many cases, the radar-based imaging algorithms have only been tested in limited numerical or experimental test cases or with simplifying assumptions such as using one estimate of permittivity for all patient test cases. In this work, the potential impact of patient-specific permittivity estimation on algorithm comparison is highlighted using representative experimental breast phantoms. In particular, the case studies presented help show that the permittivity estimate can impact the conclusions of the algorithm comparison.

Process optimization, traceability or safety are some of the topics where a positioning system can operate to improve and increase the productivity of a factory or warehouse. Among the different options, solutions based on ultra-wideband (UWB) have emerged during recent years as a good choice to obtain highly accurate estimations in indoor scenarios. However, the typical harsh wireless channel conditions found inside industrial environments, together with interferences caused by workers and machinery, constitute a challenge for this kind of system. This paper describes a real industrial problem (location and tracking of forklift trucks) that requires precise internal positioning and presents a study on the feasibility of meeting this challenge using UWB technology. To this end, a simulator of this technology was created based on UWB measurements from a set of real sensors. This simulator was used together with a location algorithm and a physical model of the forklift to obtain estimations of position in different scenarios with different obstacles. Together with the simulated UWB sensor, an additional inertial sensor and optical sensor were modeled in order to test its effect on supporting the location based on UWB.

Our research topic mainly focuses on the area of data mining and analysis by means of multi-agent orchestration of intelligent sensor nodes using internet protocols, providing also web-based HMI visualizations for data interpretability and analysis. Thanks to the rapid spreading of IoT systems, supported by modern and efficient telecommunication infrastructures and new decentralized control paradigms, the field of service-oriented programming finds new application in wireless sensor networks and microservices paradigm: we adopted such paradigm in the implementation of two different industrial use cases.

Achieving dynamic control of cellular processes could lead to even better yields by balancing the two characteristic phases of bioproduction, namely, growth versus production, which lie at the heart of a trade-off that substantially impacts productivity. The versatility and controllability offered by light will be a key element in attaining the level of control desired. The popularity of light-mediated control is increasing, with an expanding repertoire of optogenetic systems for novel applications, and many optogenetic devices have been designed to test optogenetic strains at various culture scales for bioproduction objectives. In this review, we aim to highlight the most important advances in this direction. We discuss how optogenetics is currently applied to control metabolism in the context of bioproduction, describe the optogenetic instruments and devices used at the laboratory scale for strain development, and explore how current industrial-scale bioproduction processes could be adapted for optogenetics or could benefit from existing photobioreactor designs.

The controller successfully identified management zones and changed the angular velocity of the seed metering device.              The variable-rate controller maintained the actual seeding rate according to the prescribed seeding map.                              Abstract.                The use of machines for variable-rate applications is becoming popular in modern agriculture. Due to the presence of imported and complex components, the acquisition cost of these machines is high for smallholder farmers. Several studies have been carried out using low-cost components in the development of precision agriculture machines to facilitate their adoption in low-income agriculture. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop a variable-rate controller for a low-cost precision planter. The system was developed and installed on a 1-row manual planter with a horizontal perforated disk distributor. A direct-current electric motor was used to drive the seed metering device. The angular velocity of the electric motor was controlled by a BeagleBone Black single-board computer. A program was written in Python 3.6 language, and a graphical user interface was generated by using PyQt5. Field trials were performed with maize seeds using a 28-hole disk and a prescription seeding map with four management zones. The row spacing was 0.75 m, and the planter ground speed was close to 1.0 m s-1. Field tests showed that the controller was effective at identifying the four management zones and controlling the angular velocity of the motor. By counting the number of plants germinated in the field test, it was verified that the variation in the angular velocity of the motor produced a change in the planting density. At each management zone, the planting density corresponded to the prescribed seeding map. The total cost of the parts used to assemble the controller was US$337.97, characterizing it as low cost. Successful field tests showed the potential for using low-cost components to develop variable-rate machines for smallholder farmers.

Although the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been widely applied, drones cannot perform position estimation when a GNSS signal is not available or the GNSS is disturbed. In this paper, the problem of state estimation in multi-environments is solved by employing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to fuse the data from multiple heterogeneous sensors (MHS), including an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer, a barometer, a GNSS receiver, an optical flow sensor (OFS), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and an RGB-D camera.

These devices are generally designed for elderly care, for monitoring, surveillance, and collection information. As embedded systems are ubiquitous and pervasive in a smart home, office, or space, different layout affects not only reduce the implementation cost but also the power density of electromagnetic waves. This study aimed to develop a multiple-embedded-system optimization layout to consume less electromagnetic wave power density and gain better communication strength. For smart offices, we analyzed the layout topology of n-shaped and n-shaped with door layout categories. On the basis of the location of each embedded system in a communication center via an n-shaped layout, we investigated the electromagnetic wave effect to the local, direct, and semidirect effects. Indirect and subindirect effects were also studied in the n-shaped layout with a door. In addition, we derived a set of formulas from the scope for the diverse effects to help users to quickly identify the scope of each effect. To verify the multiple-embedded-system optimization layout, 16 cooperating embedded systems with four test cases in a smart office were used to evaluate the diverse effects of electromagnetic wave power density and communication strength. Experiment results showed that the optimization layout consumed 3950 × 10−6 W/m2 electromagnetic wave power density.","2020-09-12","2023-02-14 23:54:05","2023-02-14 23:54:05","2023-02-14 23:54:05","4758","","18","13","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve that goal, it requires accurate estimation of quadrotor states followed by proper control actions. For the position estimation in a GPS-denied environment, an open source high speed optical flow sensor PX4FLOW is adopted. As for the quadrotor control, there are several challenges due to its highly nonlinear system dynamics, such as underactuation, coupling, model uncertainties, and external disturbances. To deal with those challenges, the cascaded inner–outer uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based robust control scheme has been developed and applied to the attitude and position control of a quadrotor. Extensive real flight experiments, including attitude stabilization, hover, disturbance rejection, trajectory tracking, and comparison with the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed UDE-based controllers.","2018-03-01","2023-02-14 23:53:57","2023-02-14 23:53:57","2023-02-14 23:53:57","031001","","3","140","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The multidisciplinary study of the submerged Roman harbour at Nisida Island was aimed at reconstructing the natural and anthropogenic underwater landscape by elaborating a multiscale dataset. The integrated marine surveys were carried out by an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) foreseeing the simultaneous use of geophysical and photogrammetric sensors according to the modern philosophy of multi-modal mapping. All instrumental measurements were validated by on-site measurements performed by specialised scuba divers. The multiscale analysis of the sensing data allowed a precise reconstruction of the coastal morpho-evolutive trend and the relative sea level variation in the last 2000 years by means of a new type of archaeological sea-level marker here proposed for the first time.

Our dataset includes e-bike trips and battery charging sessions spanning nearly three years, from summer 2014 until spring 2017. We also conducted three surveys both before and during the trial. Our main findings were that the primary purpose of the e-bikes in our trial was for commuting, with most trips lasting less than 20 minutes and most trips taking place in the summer months. Our battery charging analysis revealed no evidence of range anxiety, and our analysis of survey results showed little correlation between anticipated and actual use. Furthermore, when asked about their opinions about various modes of transportation, our participants rated regular bicycles higher than e-bikes even after becoming familiar with e-bikes through the field trial. Based on our analysis, we draw several conclusions, including the fact that the general population in Canada is still unaware of e-bikes and their potential. Moreover, e-bike manufacturers should target sales to nonbike users, such as seniors, rather than trying to displace sales of regular bicycles.","2017","2023-02-14 23:53:23","2023-02-14 23:53:23","2023-02-14 23:53:22","1-14","","","2017","","Journal of Advanced Transportation","Usage Patterns of Electric Bicycles","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the incorporation of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain is the need of the hour for developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends on the farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure for precision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with a methodological paradigm which can accommodate a complete model to connect ground sensors to the compute nodes in a cost-effective way by keeping the data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In this regard, this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed in precision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with respect to heavy metal in agricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly, this manuscript illustrates the processing of data generated from the sensors. In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from cloud computing has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efficient offloading of data with smooth workflow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims to open a new corridor for the farming sector in developing nations by tackling challenges and providing substantial consideration.","2021-05-21","2023-02-14 23:52:54","2023-02-14 23:52:54","2023-02-14 23:52:53","475","","6","11","","Agriculture","Smart Sensing with Edge Computing in Precision Agriculture for Soil Assessment and Heavy Metal Monitoring","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as                Drosophila melanogaster                , where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup integrates existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, and built the system around a low-cost camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and an inexpensive tablet computer to present view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. In this paper, we thoroughly document the improved system; the accompanying repository incorporates CAD files, parts lists, source code, and detailed instructions. We detail a complete ~$300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance. We report the current state of this system, which started with a 1-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues toward a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems. This access enables broad opportunities for comparative work across labs, species, and behavioral paradigms.","2021-07-16","2023-02-14 23:52:51","2023-02-14 23:52:51","2023-02-14 23:52:50","689573","","","15","","Front.

Whilst envisioning alternative economic models is key to assure the sustainability and wellbeing of present and future generations, few studies have analysed what might be the role of ‘innovation’ in a post-growth era. Innovating has become an imperative for the survival and expansion of any form of organisation. But this ‘innovate or die mania’ underpins assumptions – such as technological determinism and productivism – that neglect the socially constructed character of technological development, its politics and its capacity to enable (or disable) just and equitable societies. In this paper we posit that untangling innovation from growth is key to imagine a post-growth era. We show how alternative bottom up initiatives, promoted by a variety of different organizational forms, have challenged mainstream ideas about innovation and growth. These experiments provide a glimpse into what ‘innovation without growth’ could mean in terms of technology and social organization. We conclude by proposing new paths in research aimed at exploring under which conditions post-growth-oriented organizations can flourish and diffuse.","2021-05","2023-02-14 23:52:43","2023-02-14 23:52:43","2023-02-14 23:52:42","380-404","","3","28","","Organization","Innovation without growth","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many key workers in health and social care have experienced crippling shortages of personal protective equipment, and clinical engineers in hospitals have been severely stretched due to insufficient supplies of medical devices and equipment. Many engineers who normally work in other sectors have been redeployed to address the crisis, and they have rapidly improvised solutions to some of the challenges that emerged, using a combination of low-tech and cutting-edge methods. Much publicity has been given to efforts to design new ventilator systems and the production of 3D-printed face shields, but many other devices and systems have been developed or explored. This paper presents a description of efforts to reverse engineer or redesign critical parts, specifically a manifold for an anaesthesia station, a leak port, plasticware for COVID-19 testing, and a syringe pump lock box. The insights obtained from these projects were used to develop a product lifecycle management system based on Aras Innovator, which could with further work be deployed to facilitate future rapid response manufacturing of bespoke hardware for healthcare. The lessons learned could inform plans to exploit distributed manufacturing to secure back-up supply chains for future emergency situations. If applied generally, the concept of distributed manufacturing could give rise to “21st century cottage industries” or “nanofactories,” where high-tech goods are produced locally in small batches.","2021-08-02","2023-02-14 23:52:40","2023-02-14 23:52:40","2023-02-14 23:52:39","702526","","","3","","Front.

Addressing this, we raise the question that guides our study: how can we monitor the elderly’s residence and health conditions, detect falls, and track their movement in the vicinity of their homes in a non-intrusive manner? To answer this question, we present a system prototype that uses affordable, low-cost, and low-energy equipment with media and data processing, supported by LoRa (Long Range) and ESP32 microcontrollers, coupling several sensors. As a result, it is possible to monitor sensors that predict and detect falls or other risk events for the user, e.g., fire, with authorized persons and entities, family members, civil protection, and security forces accessing the gathered data, assuring their security. We conclude that the system could decisively improve people’s quality of life, particularly those of the elderly who live in remote places with greater vulnerability.","2021-07-19","2023-02-14 23:52:31","2023-02-14 23:52:31","2023-02-14 23:52:30","1729","","14","10","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, the 3D city model data can be stored and exchanged with the Open Geospatial Consortium CityGML format. However, currently, there is no concrete model to integrate these sensor data with the 3D city model using the Open Geospatial Consortium standards.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of “CityThings” to integrate dynamic sensor data from the Open Geospatial Consortium SensorThings API into the CityGML 3D city models. We demonstrate the implementation of the CityThings concept in the Smart Villages project in the study area of Wüstenrot, Germany, by integrating dynamic sensor data from several systems including solar panels, agro-thermal plants, and weather monitoring sensors to visualize the sensor data with the 3D city model on the web platform. In the future, this concept can be applied to interconnect dynamic sensor data and 3D city model data in other Smart Cities applications.","2021-03","2023-02-14 23:52:25","2023-02-14 23:52:25","2023-02-14 23:52:25","417-432","","3","48","","Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science","CityThings","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Devising new policies to boost Africa’s neuroscience landscape is imperative, but these must be based on accurate data on research outputs which is largely lacking. Such data must reflect the heterogeneity of research environments across the continent’s 54 countries. Here, we analyse neuroscience publications affiliated with African institutions between 1996 and 2017. Of 12,326 PubMed indexed publications, 5,219 show clear evidence that the work was performed in Africa and led by African-based researchers - on average ~5 per country and year. From here, we extract information on journals and citations, funding, international coauthorships and techniques used. For reference, we also extract the same metrics from 220 randomly selected publications each from the UK, USA, Australia, Japan and Brazil. Our dataset provides insights into the current state of African neuroscience research in a global context.","2021-06-08","2023-02-14 23:52:22","2023-02-14 23:52:22","2023-02-14 23:52:22","3429","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces RDTrack, a system that leverages changes in Doppler shifts, which are not sensitive to multipath, to accurately track the target. Moreover, RDTrack identifies particular patterns for fine-grained motions such as turning, walking straightly, etc., which can achieve accurate tracking. For the purpose of achieving a fine-grained device-free tracking system, this paper builds a trajectory estimating model using HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to improve the matching accuracy and reduce the time complexity. We address several challenges including estimating the tag influenced time period, identifying moving path and reducing false positives due to multipath. We implement RDTrack with inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) hardware and extensively evaluate RDTrack in a lobby, staircase and library. Our results show that RDTrack is effective in tracking the moving target, with a low tracking error of 32 cm. This accuracy is robust for different environments, highlighting RDTrack’s ability to enable future essential device-free moving-based interaction with RFID devices.","2018-08-27","2023-02-14 23:52:08","2023-02-14 23:52:08","2023-02-14 23:52:07","2816","","9","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research, two studies were carried out to determine the reliability of the data obtained by different SEnviro nodes installed in vineyards. Two networks of meteorological stations were used to carry out these studies, one official and the other professional. The first study was based on calculating the homogenisation of the data, which was performed using the Climatol tool. The second study proposed a similarity analysis using cross-correlation.

This wide variety of scenarios creates different challenges such as the heterogeneity of IoT devices, support for large numbers of connected devices, reliable and safe systems, energy efficiency and the possibility of using this system by third-parties in other scenarios. A transversal middleware in all IoT solutions is called an IoT platform. the IoT platform is a piece of software that works like a kind of “glue” to combine platforms and orchestrate capabilities that connect devices, users and applications/services in a “cyber-physical” world. In this way, the IoT platform can help solve the challenges listed above. This paper proposes an IoT agnostic architecture, highlighting the role of the IoT platform, within a broader ecosystem of interconnected tools, aiming at increasing scalability, stability, interoperability and reusability. For that purpose, different paradigms of computing will be used, such as microservices architecture and serverless computing. Additionally, a technological proposal of the architecture, called SEnviro Connect, is presented. This proposal is validated in the IoT scenario of smart farming, where five IoT devices (SEnviro nodes) have been deployed to improve wine production. A comprehensive performance evaluation is carried out to guarantee a scalable and stable platform.","2020-04-24","2023-02-14 23:51:42","2023-02-14 23:51:42","2023-02-14 23:51:41","2418","","8","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there are various numerical models and analytical approaches to solving particular or holistic problems in estuaries, measurements are inevitably required. In this study, we developed an innovative low-cost probe based on the Arduino platform as an alternative to more expensive measuring systems. Our device is designed to measure position, temperature, and electrical conductivity in multiple realizations, and it consists of a floating container equipped with the following components: an Arduino Mega development board, a power management module, an SD card logging module, a Bluetooth module, a temperature measuring module, a global positioning satellite (GPS) position module, and a newly developed module for measuring electrical conductivity (EC). We emphasize that all used tools are open-source and greatly supported by the worldwide community. We tested our probe during a field campaign conducted at the estuary of River Jadro near Split (Croatia). Nine probes were released at the river mouth and their position, temperature, and EC were monitored and recorded during the experiment, which ended when the probes stopped, due to the river plume attenuation. The same experiment was repeated three times. All of the probes recorded consistent temperature data, while the EC data show more variable behavior, due to the higher sensitivity of the corresponding sensor. This was expected as a part of the natural process in the estuary. The measured data were additionally used to parameterize an analytical model for mean flow velocity and salinity as a proxy concentration. This showed a good match between the experimental results and the theoretical framework. This work, although focused on water surface applications in the near field zone of an estuary, should be considered as a promising step toward the development of innovative and affordable measurement devices.","2020-01-11","2023-02-14 23:51:31","2023-02-14 23:51:31","2023-02-14 23:51:30","209","","1","12","","Water","Application of Open Source Electronics for Measurements of Surface Water Properties in an Estuary","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Authors, most of whom are practitioners, investigate grassroots methods for collaboratively designing and developing low-cost monitoring tools, crowdsourcing data analysis, and imagining ways of redressing toxicity outside of the idioms of science.  Collectively, these articles work towards remaking how knowledge is made about and across industrial systems by networking community grounded approaches for accounting for environmental health issues created by the fossil fuels and allied petrochemical industries.","2017-09-28","2023-02-14 23:51:23","2023-02-14 23:51:23","2023-02-14 23:51:22","393-425","","","3","","Engaging STS","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering portability and applications in tasks characterized by constrained or small scope areas, this article presents a compact tricopter configuration tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with full modes of flight from the rotor mode to the fixed-wing mode and vice versa. The unique multiple modes make the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle a multi-input multi-output, non-affine, multi-channel cross coupling, and nonlinear system. Considering these characteristics, a control allocation method is designed to make the controller adaptive to the full modes of flight. To reduce the cost, the accurate dynamic model of the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle is not obtained, so a full-mode flight strategy is designed in view of this situation. An autonomous flight test was conducted, and the results indicate the satisfactory performance of the control allocation method and flight strategy.","2017-01-01","2023-02-14 23:51:20","2023-02-14 23:51:20","2023-02-14 23:51:19","172988141667814","","1","14","","International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this sense, we propose an original solution based on a novel architecture that duplicates the transceivers and also the power source using a hybrid storage system. By identifying the consumption needs of the transceivers, an appropriate methodology for sizing and controlling the power flow for the power source is proposed.

Yet, imaging systems capable of accomplishing these tasks are economically unattainable for most academic and teaching laboratories around the world.

The Picroscope is compatible with standard 24-well cell culture plates and captures 3D z-stack image data. The Picroscope can be controlled remotely, allowing for automatic imaging with minimal intervention from the investigator. Here, we use this system in a range of applications. We gathered longitudinal whole organism image data for frogs, zebrafish, and planaria worms. We also gathered image data inside an incubator to observe 2D monolayers and 3D mammalian tissue culture models. Using this tool, we can measure the behavior of entire organisms or individual cells over long-time periods.","2021-11-04","2023-02-14 23:50:37","2023-02-14 23:50:37","2023-02-14 23:50:36","1261","","1","4","","Commun Biol","Picroscope","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, real-time applications usually need to process a large amount of image data, which leads to a very large computational complexity and storage consumption, and restricts its deployment on resource-constrained embedded edge devices. To reduce the computing requirements and storage occupancy of the neural network model, we proposed the ensemble binarized DroNet (EBDN) model, which implemented the reconstructed DroNet with the binarized and ensemble learning method, so that the model size of DroNet was effectively compressed, and ensemble learning method was used to overcome the defect of the poor performance of the low-precision network. Compared to the original DroNet, EBDN saves more than 7 times of memory footprint with similar model accuracy. Meanwhile, we also proposed a novel and high-efficiency hardware architecture to realize the EBDN on the chip (EBDNoC) system, which perfectly realizes the mapping of an algorithm model to hardware architecture. Compared to other solutions, the proposed architecture achieves about 10.21 GOP/s/kLUTs resource efficiency and 208.1 GOP/s/W energy efficiency, while also providing a good trade-off between model performance and resource utilization.","2021-05-13","2023-02-14 23:50:34","2023-02-14 23:50:34","2023-02-14 23:50:33","3407","","10","21","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The global aim is to stop transmission and prevent the spread of the disease. To achieve it, every country needs to scale up emergency response mechanisms, educate and actively communicate with the public, intensify infected case finding, contact tracing, monitoring, quarantine of contacts, and isolation of cases. Responding to an emergency requires efficient collaboration and a multi-skilled approach (medical, information, statistical, political, social, and other expertise), which makes it hard to define one interface for all. As actors from different perspectives and domain backgrounds need to address diverse functions, the possibility to exchange available information quickly would be desirable. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a joint state-level public health institution has not been established, but is covered by entity competencies. In this sense, a geoportal has been developed as an epidemiological location-intelligence system (ELIS) that supports the exchange of such information between the entities and the cantons. For its development, open source software components in the cloud were used as a working platform with all the necessary functionalities. The geoportal provides an entry point for access to geospatial, epidemiological, environmental and statistical data used for analysis, geocoding of confirmed COVID-19 cases, identification of disease dynamics, identification of vulnerable groups, mapping of health capacities, and general modeling of infection spread with application support for communication and collaboration between all institutions and the public.

The proposed framework uses multimodal encrypted biometric traits to perform authentication. It employs a combination of centralized and federated identity access techniques along with biometric based continuous authentication. The framework uses a fusion of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals when performing authentication. In addition to relying on the unique identification characteristics of the users’ biometric traits, the security of the framework is empowered by the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The use of HE allows patients’ data to stay encrypted when being processed or analyzed in the cloud. Thus, providing not only a fast and reliable authentication mechanism, but also closing the door to many traditional security attacks. The framework’s performance was evaluated and validated using a machine learning (ML) model that tested the framework using a dataset of 25 users in seating positions. Compared to using just ECG or PPG signals, the results of using the proposed fused-based biometric framework showed that it was successful in identifying and authenticating all 25 users with 100% accuracy.

This consumption continues to increase globally. Smart building proposals (focused on Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB), air quality monitoring, energy saving with thermal comfort, etc.) were already necessary before 2020, and the pandemic has made this research and development area more essential. Furthermore, the need to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and obtain technological solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT) requires holistic contributions through real installations that serve as spaces for measuring, testing, study and research. This article proposes a “measure–analyse–decide and act” methodology to quantify the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) for university buildings as a reference environment for energy efficiency and COVID-19 prevention models. Two conceptual spaces (physical and digital) within two dimensions (users and infrastructures) are designated over an IoT three-level model (information acquisition, interoperable communication, and data-driven decision). An IoT ecosystem (sensoriZAR) was implemented as a proof-of-concept of a smart campus at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. Focused on CO2 and energy consumption monitoring, the results showed effectiveness through real installations, demonstrating the IoT potential as SDG-enabling technologies. These contributions allow not only experimental lab tests (from the authors’ expertise in several specialties of Industrial, Mechanical, Design, Thermal, Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering) but also a reference model for direct application in academic works, research projects and institutional initiatives, extendable to professional environments, buildings and cities.","2021-07-08","2023-02-14 23:50:16","2023-02-14 23:50:16","2023-02-14 23:50:16","7647","","14","13","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This LoRa sub-network complies with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) harmonized standard for its compatibility in Europe countries. In addition, the development of the devices has allowed them to also work on a LoRaWAN network. The introduced development has been compared to a reference system mounted with laser barriers that provided a high accurate comparison. Field tests of the system have been carried out and the data obtained in the measurement has been analyzed with two different methods, and both of them were valid for the application. The results can determine vehicle speed with adequate precision at low speeds. The attenuating behavior of the communication signal is also analyzed through the Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).

Monitoring the Arctic Ocean ecosystem is key to understanding the impact of natural and human-induced change on the environment. Large data sets are required to monitor the Arctic marine ecosystem and validate high-resolution satellite observations (e.g., Sentinel), which are necessary to feed climatic and biogeochemical forecasting models. However, the Global Observing System needs to complete its geographic coverage, particularly for the harsh, extreme environment of the Arctic Region. In this scenario, autonomous systems are proving to be valuable tools for increasing the resolution of existing data.

The tested insect-proof screens were examined in three different conditions: (i) in their new, unused state; (ii) under conditions of accumulated dust and dirt after a period of 3 to 4 years of use; and (iii) under clean conditions after a period of 3 to 4 years of use and a cleaning treatment with high-pressure water. The deterioration of the screens caused the mesh to become less tense, therefore increasing its thickness and improving its aerodynamic behaviour despite a slight increase of the thread diameter and a subsequent decrease of the 2-dimensional porosity. The pressure drop coefficient, Fφ, of the used but clean screens was 1.5% to 8.8% lower (for u=1.0 m/s) than that of the new ones, thus increasing the discharge coefficient, Cd,φ, by between 0.8% and 4.8% as a result of the presence of the screens. On the other hand, comparison of the used screens in their clean and unclean states showed that the accumulation of dirt has a major bearing on their aerodynamic characteristics: Fφ increased by between 16.5% and 61.2% (for u=1.0 m/s) for the unclean screens, resulting in a Cd,φ reduction of between 7.5% and 21.3% and therefore a lower natural ventilation capacity of the greenhouse. A regular cleaning treatment of the insect-proof screens is a simple measure that improves the natural ventilation capacity of the greenhouse.","2019-01-08","2023-02-14 23:49:53","2023-02-14 23:49:53","2023-02-14 23:49:52","e0205","","4","16","","Span J Agric Res","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas these discourses are historically distinct the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 wave of struggles have precipitated the political conditions for their intersection and hybridization. Such convergence produces both tensions and possibilities. On the one hand, technopopulism engenders a radically participatory model of democracy, which is ultimately anti-institutional as citizens cooperate and engage in sophisticated decision-making without the mediation of professional politicians. On the other hand, the more successful technopopulist parties—at least in the electoral arena—are all led by charismatic leaders who synthesize the positions that emerge from the netroots to mobilize them against the establishment. These two seemingly contradictory aspects precipitate in two variants of technopopulism: a leaderless-technocratic variant, which is derived from the open source mode of governance and from early experiments of the Global Justice Movement in networked self-government; and a leaderist-populist variant, which is more strictly focused on the electoral competition as an intrinsically reductive and thus hegemonic practice. The article concludes with a reflection on the discursive complementarity of these two variants and on the political tensions and challenges technopopulism faces in the current phase.","2017-05-29","2023-02-14 23:49:41","2023-02-14 23:49:41","2023-02-14 23:49:40","441-458","","2","15","","tripleC","Technopopulism","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, many works have developed systems that provide assistance to cyclists to deal with the range anxiety problem. However, these systems may have limited applications since they can only work with the e-bike manufacturers’ hardware and communication protocols. This paper proposes an energy monitoring system (EMS) for e-bikes, which is based on EnergyBus, a standardized hardware and communication protocol for e-bikes. EnergyBus standard is based on controller area network (CAN) bus and CANopen protocols. EMS comprises a gateway connected to EnergyBus of e-bike and an EMS application installed on a smart device that connects to the gateway via Bluetooth. The gateway provides CAN bus monitoring and CANopen device data access services to the smart device. These services are modeled to determine gateway parameters to ensure the efficient performance of the gateway and to keep the working status of the monitored e-bike safe. The EMS application provides the cyclist information about battery status, rider efforts, and other related information such as distance and speed. Experimental results show that the proposed gateway can monitor data in real-time and ensure monitored system safety.","2020-07-22","2023-02-14 23:49:30","2023-02-14 23:49:30","2023-02-14 23:49:29","3766","","15","13","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, an information-based solution for industry reopening is ineffective when the necessary operational information is locked up in disparate real-time data silos. There is a lot of ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic using different combinations of low-cost, location-based contact tracing, and sensing technologies. These ad hoc Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for COVID-19 were developed using different data models and protocols without an interoperable way to interconnect these heterogeneous systems and exchange data on people and place interactions. This research aims to design and develop an interoperable Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) architecture that is able to exchange, aggregate, and reuse disparate IoT sensor data sources in order for informed decisions to be made after understanding the real-time risks in workplaces based on person-to-place interactions. The IoCT architecture is based on the Sensor Web paradigm that connects various Things, Sensors, and Datastreams with an indoor geospatial data model. This paper presents a study of what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first real-world integrated implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and IndoorGML standards to calculate the risk of COVID-19 online using a workplace reopening case study. The proposed IoCT offers a new open standard-based information model, architecture, methodologies, and software tools that enable the interoperability of disparate COVID-19 monitoring systems with finer spatial-temporal granularity. A workplace cleaning use case was developed in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed IoCT architecture. The implemented IoCT architecture included proximity-based contact tracing, people density sensors, a COVID-19 risky behavior monitoring system, and the contextual building geospatial data.","2020-12-24","2023-02-14 23:49:27","2023-02-14 23:49:27","2023-02-14 23:49:27","50","","1","21","","Sensors","An Interoperable Architecture for the Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) Using Open Geospatial Standards—Case Study","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This resulted in global supply bottlenecks for medical protective equipment. The so-called Maker Movement recognized this emerging problem early on and, with the help of additive manufacturing (AM), began developing and manufacturing half masks or face shields as personal protective equipment (PPE). This knowledge has been made available in many places in form of open source product data, so that products could be adapted and improved, saving development time.                                            Methods                This production and innovation potential has been taken up and professionalized by the authors of this article. By means of a proof-of-principle we provide an overview of the possibility and successful unique introduction of a so-called professional “hybrid production” in a micro factory using 3D-printing at the place of greatest demand in a hospital by medical personnel to produce their own PPE. Furthermore the learning process and future benefits of on site 3D-printing are described.                                            Results                Our proof-of-principle successfully showed that the allocation of 3D-printing capabilities in the hospital infrastructure is possible. With assistance of the engineers, responsible for product design and development, the medical staff was able to produce PPE by means of AM. However, due to legal uncertainties and high material and production costs the usability is severely limited.                                            Conclusions                The practical research showed that a complete implementation of the concept and the short-term establishment of a 3D-printing factory for the autonomous supply of a hospital with PPE was not feasible without further efforts. Nevertheless, it has enabled the medical staff to use AM technologies for future research approaches.","2020-12","2023-02-14 23:49:19","2023-02-14 23:49:19","2023-02-14 23:49:18","37","","1","6","","3D Print Med","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This system was designed for installation on top of analog, magnetically driven, positive displacement, residential water meters and can collect data at a variable time resolution interval. The system couples an Arduino Pro microcontroller board, a datalogging shield customized for this specific application, and a magnetometer sensor. The system was developed and calibrated at the Utah Water Research Laboratory and was deployed for testing on five single family residences in Logan and Providence, Utah, for a period of over 1 month. Battery life for the device was estimated to be over 5 weeks with continuous data collection at a 4 s time interval. Data collected using this system, under ideal installation conditions, was within 2% of the volume recorded by the register of the meter on which they were installed. Results from field deployments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, functionality, and applicability of the system. Results indicate that the device is capable of collecting data at a temporal resolution sufficient for identifying individual water use events and analyzing water use at coarser temporal resolutions. This system is of special interest for water end use studies, future projections of residential water use, water infrastructure design, and for advancing our understanding of water use timing and behavior. The system’s hardware design and software are open source, are available for potential reuse, and can be customized for specific research needs.","2020-06-29","2023-02-14 23:49:16","2023-02-14 23:49:16","2023-02-14 23:49:15","3655","","13","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It sets up the eight variables of the four areas that comprise the DSI, and then identifies the causal conditions (arrangements) based on the empirical findings through the fuzzy-set multi-conjunctural analysis. In short, it concludes that, if OECD member countries have high level of democracy and e-participation, high GDP and business-friendly environment, high social expenditure, and high level of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) development and patent applications, they are highly likely to achieve a sufficient level of digital social innovation. This study underlines that the result of combined arrangement explains that the DSI can be more properly characterized by the multi-level and structured approach of the socio-technical system transition that goes beyond the fragmentary approach of existing innovation theories and the current related academic field. Moreover, this study reveals that the social factors (including the social capital variable) that have attracted attention from previous studies may have little effect on the DSI. In essence, it suggests that citizen interaction and social change can be newly formed through technological innovation in a multi-dimensional way, and that more in-depth discussion regarding the new context of ‘digital citizen’ might be required.","2019-09-06","2023-02-14 23:48:56","2023-02-14 23:48:56","2023-02-14 23:48:56","4887","","18","11","","Sustainability","Multiple Conjunctural Impact on Digital Social Innovation","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this new article, we argue that a new post–gross domestic product economy focusing on wellbeing rather than material output is already emerging in the Anthropocene, thanks to the convergence of policy reforms and economic shifts. At the policy level, the Sustainable Development Goals require policymakers to protect ecosystems, promote greater equality, and focus on long-term equitable development. At the economy level, the provision of services has outpaced industrial production as the key driver of prosperity, with innovative business models optimizing the match between supply and demand and giving rise to a burgeoning “sharing economy”, which produces value to people while reducing output and costs. The economic transformation already underway is, however, delayed by an obsolete system of measurement of economic performance still dominated by the gross domestic product–based national accounts, which rewards the incumbent and disincentives the new. We show that a different approach to measuring wellbeing and prosperity is the “missing link” we need to connect recent evolutions in policy and the economy with a view to activating a sustainable development paradigm for a good Anthropocene.","2019-12","2023-02-14 23:48:51","2023-02-14 23:48:51","2023-02-14 23:48:51","207-222","","3","6","","The Anthropocene Review","From gross domestic product to wellbeing","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","green","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In terms of mobility the cities that embrace the sensoring era can take advantage of this disruptive technology to improve the quality of life of their citizens, also thanks to the rationalization in the use of their resources. In Sii-Mobility, a national smart city project on mobility and transportation, a flexible platform has been designed and here, in this paper, is presented. It permits one to set up heterogeneous and complex scenarios that integrate sensors/actuators as IoT/IoE in an overall Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Analytics scenario. A detailed and complex case-study has been presented to validate the solution in the context of a system that dynamically reverse the traveling direction of a road segment, with all the safety conditions in place. This case study composes several building blocks of the IoT platform, which demonstrate that a flexible and dynamic set-up is possible, supporting security, safety, local, cloud and mixed solutions.","2018-12-20","2023-02-14 23:48:35","2023-02-14 23:48:35","2023-02-14 23:48:34","1","","1","19","","Sensors","Sii-Mobility","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that the dynamic airflow caused by drones affects temperature and humidity levels of the ambient air, which then affect the measurement quality of gas sensors. Then, in the second part of this article, we leverage the effects of weather conditions on pollution measurements’ quality in order to design an unmanned aerial vehicle mission planning algorithm that adapts the trajectory of the drones while taking into account the quality of aerial measurements.

We refer to these spaces as digital folds. Our paper contributes to the extant literature by providing a process theory of how transparency and openness are balanced with opacity and closure in open source communities according to the needs of the development work; by conceptualizing the nature of digital folds and their role in providing quiet spaces of work; and, by articulating how the process of digital folding and unfolding is made far more possible by select elite actors’ navigating the line between the pragmatics of coding and the accepted ideology of openness and transparency.","2016-12","2023-02-14 23:48:06","2023-02-14 23:48:06","2023-02-14 23:48:06","813-833","","4","27","","Information Systems Research","Folding and Unfolding","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","green","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, wearable biometrics have substantial differences from traditional biometrics for computer systems, such as fingerprints, eye features, or voice. In this article, we discuss these differences and analyse how researchers are approaching the wearable biometrics field. We review and provide a categorization of wearable sensors useful for capturing biometric signals. We analyse the computational cost of the different signal processing techniques, an important practical factor in constrained devices such as wearables. Finally, we review and classify the most recent proposals in the field of wearable biometrics in terms of the structure of the biometric system proposed, their experimental setup, and their results.

Rather than discussing it as a model of organising work, the study conceives free software as a production tool and shows how it becomes a locus of politics about finding material security in flexible capitalism. This politics is ultimately contradictory in that it extends creative and craft autonomy of digital artists but does not mobilise a critical project. Instead, it nurtures further precarious labour.

The proposed approach offers benefits over other current solutions, such as wide-area radio-frequency jamming that interferes with regular communication devices or high-energy military laser systems that are expensive and time consuming to set up. A linear dynamics model of the AR.Drone 2.0 vehicle stabilized by its onboard feedback control system is derived, and its parameters are experimentally identified. A linear model predictive control is developed to track specified flight trajectories, then implemented and validated in hardware flight tests. Detection and ranging of the target UAV from the pursuer UAV’s onboard monocular camera are performed using the YOLO v2 convolutional neural network algorithm.

This article investigates the potential to make all information and the whole work process of a qualification project such as a doctoral thesis comprehensively and freely accessible on the internet with an open free license both in the final form and completely traceable in development. The answer to the initial question, the self-experiment and the associated demand for openness, posed several challenges for a doctoral student, the institution, and the examination regulations, which are still based on the publication of an individually written and completed work that cannot be viewed by the public during the creation process. In the case of data and other documents, publication is usually not planned even after completion. This state of affairs in the use of open science in the humanities will be compared with open science best practices in the physical sciences. The reasons and influencing factors for open developments in science and research are presented, empirically and experimentally tested in the development of the first completely open humanities-based PhD thesis.

The current methodology of utilizing specialized equipment such as snooper trucks and scaffolding to support manned-inspections poses a significant financial cost, disrupts traffic, and is dangerous to the inspectors and public. The advent of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), more commonly called drones, presents a practical solution that promises reduced cost, enhanced safety, and is significantly less intrusive than previous methodologies. Current limitations in the implementation of UAS include the reliance on a skilled operator and/or the requirement for a UAS to operate in a cluttered, GPS-denied environment. A solution to these challenges is presented in this paper by utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware including laser rangefinders, optical flow sensors, and live video telemetry. Included in the system is the obstacle avoidance equipped drone and a ground station intended to be manned by a pilot and bridge inspector. The proposed custom-fabricated UAS was implemented during eight inspections of Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) bridges. The UAS was able to navigate under GPS-denied and obstacle-laden bridge decks with position-hold performance comparable to, if not better than, a COTS unit in an unobstructed environment. The position hold capability maintained an altitude of ±12.8 cm with a horizontal hold of ±435 cm. Details of the hardware, algorithm development, and suggestions for future research are discussed in this paper.","2020-09-18","2023-02-14 23:47:39","2023-02-14 23:47:39","2023-02-14 23:47:38","5358","","18","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beneath the simplicity offered by these solutions, we usually find complex, multi-layer architectures—from hardware sensors up to data analytics systems. These rely heavily on software running on the on-location gateway devices designed to bridge the communication between the sensors and the cloud. This will generally require updates and improvements—raising deployment and maintenance challenges. Especially for large scale commercial solutions, a secure and fail-safe updating system becomes crucial for a successful IoT deployment. This paper explores the specific challenges for infrastructures dedicated to remote application deployment and management, addresses the management challenges related to IoT sensors systems, and proposes a mathematical model and a methodology for tackling this. To test the model’s efficiency, we implemented it as a software infrastructure system for complete commercial IoT products. As proof, we present the deployment of 100 smart soda dispensing machines in three locations. Each machine relies on sensors monitoring its status and on gateways controlling its behaviour, each receiving 133 different remote software updates through our solution. In addition, 80% of the machines ran non-interrupted for 250 days, with 20% failing due to external factors; out of the 80%, 30% experienced temporary update failures due to reduced hardware capabilities and the system successfully performed automatic rollback of the system, thus recovering in 100% of the temporary failures.","2020-08-06","2023-02-14 23:47:33","2023-02-14 23:47:33","2023-02-14 23:47:32","4393","","16","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Open source ad blockers have the potential to reduce the time and thus electricity spent using computers by eliminating ads during Internet browsing and video streaming. In this study, three open source ad blockers are tested against a no-ad blocker control. Page load time is recorded for browsing a representative selection of the globally most-accessed websites, and the time spent watching ads on videos is quantified for both trending and non-trending content. The results show that page load time dropped 11% with AdBlock+, 22.2% with Privacy Badger, and 28.5% with uBlock Origin. Thus, uBlock Origin has the potential to save the average global Internet user more than 100 h annually. The energy conserved if everyone in the United States used the open source ad blocker would save over 36 Americans lives per year if it were to offset coal-fired electricity generated-based pollution. In the United States, if all Internet users enabled Privacy Badger on their computers, Americans would save more than $91 million annually. Globally, uBlock Origin could save consumers more than $1.8 billion/year.

Leveraging design methodologies for critical sociological purposes (a) allows us to envision programming as a means of opening up ‘black boxes’ by engaging more directly with the code through which software applications are executed, and (b) indicates the potential for sociology practitioners to design software ourselves – to build applications that fulfil the radical promise of sociology by intervening in social processes. To concretise these ideas, this article presents two stories about social media bots developed by the author: ‘Philbot’ (a Facebook random status generator) and ‘ @_Zen_Bot_ ’ (a Twitter service that provides mock lifestyle advice to users).

A procedure based on LQR/LQG (Linear Quadratic Regulator/Gaussian) theory is proposed for attitude and altitude control, which suposes a considerable simplification of the design problem due to only one pretuning parameter being used. With the aim to analyze the performance and robustness of the proposed method, a non-linear mathematical model of the DJI-F450 quadrotor is employed, where rotors dynamics, together with sensors drift/bias properties and noise characteristics of low-cost commercial sensors typically used in this type of applications are considered. In order to estimate the state vector and compensate bias/drift effects in the measures, a combination of filtering and data fusion algorithms (Kalman filter and Madgwick algorithm for attitude estimation) are proposed and implemented. Performance and robustness analysis of the control system is carried out by employing numerical simulations, which take into account the presence of uncertainty in the plant model and external disturbances. The obtained results show the proposed controller design method for multivariable PID controller is robust with respect to: (a) parametric uncertainty in the plant model, (b) disturbances acting at the plant input, (c) sensors measurement and estimation errors.","2019-05-01","2023-02-15 00:02:38","2023-02-15 00:02:38","2023-02-15 00:02:37","36","","2","8","","Robotics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The electric bike includes all the benefits that conventional bicycles offer, plus faster, more comfortable and longer trips, as well as less effort for the user. In this paper, we specifically focus on a new type of e-bike, the so-called ‘solar-powered e-bike’. Therefore, this review paper explores existing literature findings for the use of solar energy in transportation, and more specifically in e-bikes. This paper aims to capture the status of and experiences with the use of e-bikes; more specifically, with solar-powered e-bikes. It presents research conducted so far on e-bikes and solar-powered e-bikes, as well as the main technical features of the solar e-bike. Finally, it analyzes a sample of e-bikes’ and solar-powered e-bikes’ users, based on Dutch National Travel Survey data and an experimental field study conducted in 2017. Data showed that the main target group of (solar) e-bikes are commuters in the age group between 40 and 60 years old, commuting distances longer than 6 km, with a gross income higher than €2500. Solar-powered e-bikes are concluded to have potential as a sustainable way of transportation in urban areas and cities, potentially replacing the conventional means of transport.","2018-08-15","2023-02-15 00:01:49","2023-02-15 00:01:49","2023-02-15 00:01:48","2129","","8","11","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, the system for data acquisition is very easily interfered by the environment, the power, and the bio-amplifier, so that the results will lead to a failed promotion of capturing high SNR signals, especially in the tiny brain wave signal. In this study, it has been designed an inexpensive, purpose-built, high SNR brainwave signals measurement system. The system is composed of an improved capture system, record system, and analysis system. To better consider the strength and characteristics of the tiny brainwave signals, the system was designed to include a suitable bio-amplifier to make each channel of the invasive microelectrode able to collect the brainwave signals correctly and it provides recording and analysis software, which can not only extract the characteristics of brainwave signals, but also quickly classify signals. The system can collect biological signals from 10[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]V to 420[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]V and has a high SNR[Formula: see text]30. The proposed system is easy to make and can be fabricated for the relatively low cost of only US$203. The brain wave signals from the three actions can also be easily classified, with a correct rate up to 46.70%.

As a product of variable agricultural ingredients and processes, beer has high molecular complexity. We used DIA/SWATH-MS to investigate the proteomic complexity and diversity of 23 commercial Australian beers. While the overall complexity of the beer proteome was modest, with contributions from barley and yeast proteins, we uncovered a very high diversity of post-translational modifications (PTMs), especially proteolysis, glycation, and glycosylation. Proteolysis was widespread throughout barley proteins, but showed clear site-specificity. Oligohexose modifications were common on lysines in barley proteins, consistent with glycation by maltooligosaccharides released from starch during malting or mashing.                O                -glycosylation consistent with oligomannose was abundant on secreted yeast glycoproteins. We developed and used data analysis pipelines to efficiently extract and quantify site-specific PTMs from SWATH-MS data, and showed incorporating these features into proteomic analyses extended analytical precision. We found that the key differentiator of the beer glyco/proteome was the brewery, with beer from independent breweries having a distinct profile to beer from multinational breweries. Within a given brewery, beer styles also had distinct glyco/proteomes. Targeting our analyses to beers from a single brewery, Newstead Brewing Co., allowed us to identify beer style-specific features of the glyco/proteome. Specifically, we found that proteins in darker beers tended to have low glycation and high proteolysis. Finally, we objectively quantified features of foam formation and stability, and showed that these quality properties correlated with the concentration of abundant surface-active proteins from barley and yeast.","2021-08-05","2023-02-15 00:01:41","2023-02-15 00:01:41","2023-02-15 00:01:40","15890","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As recent advances in electronics, rapid prototyping and unmanned-vehicle technologies expand its capabilities and lower its cost, this experimental method is seeing growing interest across academia and the industry. However, subscale models cannot meet all similarity conditions required for simulating full-scale flight. This leads to a variety of approaches to scaling and to other alternative applications. Through a literature review and analysis of different scaling strategies, this study presents an overall picture of how subscale flight testing has been used in recent years and synthesises its main issues and practical limitations. Results show that, while the estimation of full-scale characteristics is still an interesting application within certain flight conditions, subscale models are progressively taking a broader role as low-cost technology-testing platforms with relaxed similarity constraints. Different approaches to tackle the identified practical challenges, implemented both by the authors and by other organisations, are discussed and evaluated through flight experiments.","2021-03-12","2023-02-15 00:01:27","2023-02-15 00:01:27","2023-02-15 00:01:26","74","","3","8","","Aerospace","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main issues in Latin America are the high-cost of solutions, no inclusion of renewable energies, poor energy management, the use of foreign systems not adapted to local contexts, ineffective regional legislation and politics, among others. In this paper the main technical issues concerning the implementation of a bike-sharing system using pedaling-assisted (PAS) electric bicycles for Bogota City are discussed and a solution is proposed. To solve such problems, a methodology to design a tailored solution well suited to Bogota citizen’s needs is developed. Such methodology starts with the development of an on-board-computer (OBC) in order to characterize bike-users by collecting a rider’s data in real-time. Furthermore, the proposed solution develops a low-cost middle-drive (mid-drive) propulsion system for the PAS in the electric bike using brushless-DC (BLDC) motors and by implementing a field-oriented controller (FOC). The reported bike-sharing system also includes the development and implementation of two charging-stations that enable charging the battery on the electric bikes exclusively by using photovoltaic energy.

In the mining industry, belt idlers or rollers are examples of such critical components. Although there are many precise laboratory techniques to assess the condition of a roller, companies still have trouble implementing a reliable and scalable procedure to inspect their field assets. This article enumerates and discusses the existing roller inspection techniques and presents a novel approach based on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integrated with a thermal imaging camera. Our preliminary results indicate that using a signal processing technique, we are able to identify roller failures automatically. We also proposed and implemented a back-end platform that enables field and cloud connectivity with enterprise systems.

This often includes the detection of the operative states of electrical appliances, which in turn allows for the recognition of user activities and intentions. For electrical appliances with largely different power consumption characteristics, their types and operational times can be easily inferred from data collected at a single metering point (typically, a smart meter). However, a disambiguation between consumers of the same type and model, yet located in different areas of a smart building, is not possible this way. Likewise, small consumers (e.g., wall chargers) are often indiscernible from measurement noise and spurious power consumption events of other appliances. As a consequence thereof, we investigate how additional sensing modalities, i.e., data beyond electrical signals, can be leveraged to improve the appliance detection accuracy. Through a set of practical experiments, recording ambient influences in eight dimensions and testing their effects on 21 appliance types, we evaluate the importance of such added features in the context of appliance recognition. Our results show that electrical power measurements already yield a high appliance recognition accuracy, yet further accuracy improvements are possible when considering ambient parameters as well.","2021-01-01","2023-02-15 00:00:41","2023-02-15 00:00:41","2023-02-15 00:00:41","188","","1","14","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world’s population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach.","2021-06-13","2023-02-15 00:00:39","2023-02-15 00:00:39","2023-02-15 00:00:38","1422","","12","10","","Electronics","State of the Art of Urban Smart Vertical Farming Automation System","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The telomeric shelterin protein TRF2 suppresses the DDR, and this function has been attributed to its abilities to trigger t-loop formation or prevent massive decompaction and loss of density of telomeric chromatin. Here, we applied stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to measure the sizes and shapes of functional human telomeres of different lengths and dysfunctional telomeres that elicit a DDR. Telomeres have an ovoid appearance with considerable plasticity in shape. Examination of many telomeres demonstrated that depletion of TRF2, TRF1, or both affected the sizes of only a small subset of telomeres. Costaining of telomeres with DDR markers further revealed that the majority of DDR signaling telomeres retained a normal size. Thus, DDR signaling at telomeres does not require decompaction. We propose that telomeres are monitored by the DDR machinery in the absence of telomere expansion and that the DDR is triggered by changes at the molecular level in structure and protein composition.","2017-03-15","2023-02-15 00:00:12","2023-02-15 00:00:12","2023-02-15 00:00:12","567-577","","6","31","","Genes Dev.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In comparison with the isolated individual control of converters in a microgrid, DC microgrids provide better voltage regulation and harmonized energy generation/consumption. To address the inherent vulnerability of communication links, robust methods have been proposed that improve the resilience of communication-based control. However, the failure of the communication links in microgrid control layers remains a considerable issue that may lead to one or more nodes being disconnected and operating as a communication island. Such types of communication islanding may cause the unpredictable behavior of the system and further destabilization may lead to a cascaded failure. This paper proposes a fast algorithm to detect and evaluate network connectivity based on the information stored at every node in the form of a look-up table. The control structure has been modified under communication islanding, and a communication connectivity observer is used at every node to detect and address power flow issues under communication islanding. The proposed method has been verified through mathematical analysis, simulation, and experimental results.","2018-12-10","2023-02-15 00:00:09","2023-02-15 00:00:09","2023-02-15 00:00:09","418","","12","7","","Electronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A more precise characterization of the environment will allow a better dealing with genotype-by-environment-by-management interactions. Therefore, space and time dependencies of the crop production processes have to be considered. The use of novel sensor technologies has drastically increased the amount and diversity of phenotypic data from agronomic field trials. Existing data management systems either do not consider space and time, are not customizable to individual needs such as field trial handling, or have restricted availability. Hence, we propose an integrative data management and information system (DMIS) for handling of traditional and novel sensor-based phenotypic, environmental and management data. The DMIS must be customizable, applicable and scalable from individual users to organizations.                                            Results                Key element of the system is a dynamic PostgreSQL database with GIS-extension, capable of importing, storing and managing all types of data including images. The database references every structural database object and measurement in a threefold approach with semantic, spatial and temporal reference. Timestamps and geo-coordinates allow automated linking of all data. Traits can be precisely defined individually or uploaded as predefined lists. Filtering and selection routines allow compilation of all data for visualization via tables, charts or maps and for export and external statistical analysis. New possibilities of environmental information-based planning of field trials, weather-guided phenotyping and data analysis for outlier or hot-spot detection are demonstrated.                                            Conclusions                The DMIS supports users in handling experimental field trials with crop plants and modern phenotyping methods. It focuses on linking all space and time dependent processes of plant production.

However, broader applications remain restrictive due to compatibility with conventional cell culture workflow and biochemical sensors, accessibility to up-right physiological imaging, or parallelization of data acquisition. Here, we introduce miniaturized modular-array fluorescence microscopy (MAM) for compact live-cell imaging in flexible formats. We advance the current miniscopy technology to devise an up-right modular architecture, each combining a gradient-index (GRIN) objective and individually-addressed illumination and acquisition components. Parallelization of an array of such modular devices allows for multi-site data acquisition                in situ                using conventional off-the-shelf cell chambers. Compared with existing methods, the device offers a high fluorescence sensitivity and efficiency, exquisite spatiotemporal resolution (∼3 µm and up to 60 Hz), a configuration compatible with conventional cell culture assays and physiological imaging, and an effective parallelization of data acquisition.

This pandemic has shown that future living will need to be agile and flexible to adapt to the various changes in needs of societal populations. Digital technology has played an integral role during COVID-19, assisting various sectors of the community, and demonstrating that smart cities can provide opportunities to respond to many future societal challenges. In the decades ahead, the rise in aging populations will be one of these challenges, and one in which the needs and requirements between demographic cohorts will vary greatly. Although we need to create future smart age-friendly ecosystems to meet these needs, technology still does not feature in the WHO eight domains of an age-friendly city. This paper extends upon Marston and van Hoof’s ‘Smart Age-friendly Ecosystem’ (SAfE) framework, and explores how digital technology, design hacking, and research approaches can be used to understand a smart age-friendly ecosystem in a post-pandemic society. By exploring a series of case studies and using real-life scenarios from the standpoint of COVID-19, we propose the ‘Concept of Age-friendly Smart Ecologies (CASE)’ framework. We provide an insight into a myriad of contemporary multi-disciplinary research, which are capable to initiate discussions and bring various actors together with a positive impact on future planning and development of age-friendly ecosystems. The strengths and limitations of this framework are outlined, with advantages evident in the opportunity for towns, regions/counties, provinces, and states to take an agile approach and work together in adopting and implement improvements for the greater benefits of residents and citizens.","2020-11-09","2023-02-14 23:59:40","2023-02-14 23:59:40","2023-02-14 23:59:40","8276","","21","17","","IJERPH","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The manufacturing process can be completed in less than 6 h making it a viable technique for testing new designs quickly. The technique is validated by creating a microfluidic device with channels of height and depth of 300 µm, with a ramp test structure where the height and width of the channels reduces to 100 µm to demonstrate the techniques 3D capabilities. The resulting PDMS device was easily removed from the metallic mould and closely replicated the shape aside the expected shrinkage during thermal curing. As the technique uses a single replica process, the surface roughness at the base of the channels corresponds to the un-ablated polished metal mould, resulting in a very low surface roughness of 0.361 nm. The ablated metallic mould surface corresponds to the top of the PDMS device, which is bonded to glass and does not affect the flow within the channels, reducing the need for optimisation of laser parameters.

This manuscript presents work in the field of event-driven architectures as part of spatial data infrastructures with a particular focus on sensor networks and the devices capturing in-situ measurements. The current landscape of spatial data infrastructures is outlined and used as the basis for identifying existing gaps that retain certain geospatial applications from using real-time information. We present a selection of approaches—developed in different research projects—to overcome these gaps. Being designed for specific application domains, these approaches share commonalities as well as orthogonal solutions and can build the foundation of an overall event-driven spatial data infrastructure.","2018-09-25","2023-02-14 23:58:55","2023-02-14 23:58:55","2023-02-14 23:58:55","385","","10","7","","IJGI","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The overwhelming amount of produced content and resulting network traffic gives rise to precarious scalability issues for social networks, such as handling a large number of users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, and data storage. There are few surveys conducted to explore the different dimensions of social networks, such as security, privacy, and data acquisition. Most of the surveys focus on privacy or security-related issues and do not specifically address scalability challenges faced by social networks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study of social networks along with their significant characteristics and categorize social network architectures into three broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) hybrid.

An understanding of the role played by tidewater glaciers in marine primary production is still affected by a lack of data from close proximity to glacier fronts, to which, for safety reasons, manned surface vessels cannot get too close. In this context, autonomous marine vehicles can play a key role in collecting high quality data in dangerous interface areas. In particular, the contribution given by light, portable, and modular marine robots is discussed in this paper. The state-of-the-art of technology and of operating procedures is established on the basis of the experience gained in campaigns carried out by Italian National Research Council (CNR) robotic researchers in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard Islands, in 2015, 2017, and 2018 respectively. The aim was to demonstrate the capability of an Unmanned Semi-Submersible Vehicle (USSV): (i) To collect water samples in contact with the front of a tidewater glacier; (ii) to work in cooperation with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for sea surface and air column characterisation in the proximity of the fronts of the glaciers; and (iii) to perform, when equipped with suitable tools and instruments, repetitive sampling of water surface as well as profiling the parameters of the water and air column close to the fronts of the tidewater glaciers. The article also reports the issues encountered in navigating in the middle of bergy bits and growlers as well as the problems faced in using some sensors at high latitudes.","2020-05-27","2023-02-14 23:58:41","2023-02-14 23:58:41","2023-02-14 23:58:41","1707","","11","12","","Remote Sensing","Monitoring of Sea-Ice-Atmosphere Interface in the Proximity of Arctic Tidewater Glaciers","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article examines and critiques the historic development, current position, gaps in knowledge, and future implications for survey-based   research. Two-hundred eighty-six articles from four events-specific journals were reviewed. Some diversity is found within survey-based research; however, the majority was carried out: as a single method (86%), in physical proximity to the event (67%), during the event (49%), using paper-based   forms (65%), designed for self-completion (94%). The most common events targeted were: sports (43%) festivals & celebrations (20%), and music (12%). The stakeholders targeted were: audiences (54%), nonparticipants (16%), and managers (12%). Sampling methods, where stated, were likely to   be random (23%) or convenience based (22%). Despite the predominance of this data collection tool, numerous areas are ideally in need of further understanding and experimentation. Mixed methods, multiple surveys, and more deliberate approaches to sampling are required. Despite an audience   focus, ""before and after"" studies are lacking. Electronic surveys and other emerging technologies undoubtedly provide options but these do not appear to have been investigated or adopted with sufficient rigor. Targeting stakeholders other than audiences, covering a broader range of events,   and longitudinal studies would also be desirable. The use of survey-based research by policy makers and funders is discussed as it potentially orients towards what the authors term ""operationalized knowledge management."" A brief but comprehensive typology of survey methods is established to   aid future researchers.","2020-04-07","2023-02-14 23:58:28","2023-02-14 23:58:28","2023-02-14 23:58:27","217-233","","2","24","","Event Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","green","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is to fill this gap. To be specific, the purpose of this paper is to answer the following two questions. What is the comparative advantage of 3D printing technology among countries? What is the relative impact of 3D printing technology in the worldwide?                                            Design/methodology/approach                Patent bibliometric analysis was used for analyzing and collecting data to find critical information of 3D printing. Some indicators (RTA, FSGI, RII, CV) have been applied in analyzing the national patterns of technology accumulation in developed and developing countries by using patent statistics.                                            Findings                First, the USA, Japan, and Germany are the leading countries in 3D printing technology, while the technology accumulation patterns of these countries are rather different. Second, Israel and Italy have good performance in the fast-growing technology sub-fields. Third, although the number of patents owned by developing countries, such as China and Russia, is not few, the citations received by these patents are low.                                            Research limitations/implications                A limitation of this study is that technological development can be reflected by many indicators and patent statistic is merely one reflection form. This study just analyzes the 3D printing technology development from the perspective of patent statistic, the authors would like to continue the comprehensive analysis with the other data indicators in a future study.

An optimized sensor was obtained by designing a PMA in accordance with the characteristics of the electromagnetic signal produced by PD. An ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna was obtained by applying the truncated ground plane technique. The patch geometry was bio-inspired by that of the Inga Marginata leaf, resulting in a significant reduction in size. To verify the operating frequency and gain of the PMA, measurements were carried out in an anechoic chamber. The results show that the antenna operating bandwidth covers most of the frequency range of PD occurrence. Moreover, the antenna presented a good sensitivity (mean gain of 3.63 dBi). The antenna performance was evaluated through comparative results with the standard IEC 60270 method. For this purpose, simultaneous tests were carried out in a PD generator arrangement, composed by an oil cell with point-to-plane electrode configurations. The developed PMA can be classified as an optimized sensor for PD detection and suitable for substation application, since it is able to measure PD radiated signals with half the voltage levels obtained from the IEC method and is immune to corona discharges.","2019-02-01","2023-02-14 23:58:09","2023-02-14 23:58:09","2023-02-14 23:58:08","628","","3","19","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our system (the Interactive Plant system) senses the electrical capacitance of the human body and visualizes users’ tactile information on a flat screen (when the touch is gentle, the program draws small and thin roots around the pot; when the touch is more harsh or abrupt, big and thick roots are displayed). We contrasted this multimodal combination (touch + vision) with a unimodal interface (touch only or watch only) and measured the impact of the multimodal interaction on participants’ emotion. We found significant emotional gains in the multimodal interaction. Participants’ self-reported positive affect, joviality, attentiveness and self-assurance increased dramatically in multimodal interaction relative to unimodal interaction; participants’ electrodermal activity (EDA) increased in the multimodal condition, suggesting that our plant-based multisensory visual-tactile interaction raised arousal.

Through analysing the nature of citizens’ concerns and proposed solutions, we explore the benefits of our approach, arguing that engaging citizens can uncover hyper-local concerns that provide a foundation for finding solutions to address citizen concerns. By reflecting on our approach, we identify four key challenges to utilising PD at an urban scale; balancing scale with the personal, who has control of the process, who is participating and integrating citizen-led work with local authorities. By addressing these challenges, we will be able to truly engage citizens as collaborators in co-designing their city.","2018-02-28","2023-02-14 23:57:52","2023-02-14 23:57:52","2023-02-14 23:57:52","1-34","","1","25","","ACM Trans.

A more complex micro-architecture leads to better peak performance and worse power consumption. Shutting down the units designed for performance enhancement could improve energy efficiency in low-workload scenarios. In this paper, we evaluated the energy distribution in various embedded processors. According to the analysis, pipeline registers and the dynamic branch predictor, which are employed for better peak performance, have great impacts on energy efficiency. Thus, we proposed an ultra-low-power processor with variable micro-architecture. The processor is based on a 4-stage pipeline core with a Gshare branch predictor, and all units work in high-performance mode. In normal mode, the Gshare predictor is shut down and Always-Not-Taken prediction is used. In low-power mode, some of the pipeline registers are bypassed to avoid unnecessary energy dissipation and improve executing efficiency. A mode register (MR) is designed to indicate current working mode. Switching between different modes is controlled by the software. The proposed core is implemented in 40 nm technology and simulated with the traces of 17 benchmarks in Embench. The average amounts of power consumed by the respective modes are 41.7 μW, 59.7 μW and 71.1 μW. The results show that normal mode (N-mode) and low-power mode (L-mode) consume 16.08% and 41.37% less power than high-performance mode (H-mode) on average. In best case scenarios, they could save 25.36% and 49.30% more power than H-mode. Considering the execution efficiency evaluated by instructions per cycle (IPC), the proposed processor consumes 7.78% or 51.57% less energy for each instruction than the baseline core. The area of the proposed processor is only 7.19% larger than the baseline core, and only 3.08% more power is consumed in H-mode.","2021-03-10","2023-02-14 23:57:31","2023-02-14 23:57:31","2023-02-14 23:57:30","292","","3","12","","Micromachines","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, factors influencing team formation relative to the composition of expertise are crucial for both organizational performance and for informing policy. In this paper, I draw attention to technology access as a highly influential factor impacting expertise in team formation. I examine the hack of Microsoft Kinect as an exogenous event that suddenly reduced motion-sensing technology costs. I show that great reductions in technology costs substitute for ex ante optimal involvement of area specialists and facilitate involvement of outside-area specialists through collaboration with researchers with broader knowledge—generalists. In other words, technology costs influence the composition of expertise in teamwork, with sufficiently large reductions leading to knowledge creation that combines more broadly across knowledge areas. These findings have important implications for organizations and policy makers in crafting incentives for more diverse knowledge creation through strategic investments that lower technology costs and influence team formation.

The article is divided in four parts. First, we contextualize our research by discussing some of our findings and situating them against what we define as a ‘third wave’ of institutional developments in international justice, prompted by an ‘accountability-turn’ affecting civil society groups and UN mandates. Secondly, we discuss — using real-world examples — both the opportunities and challenges arising from the use of digital and new documentation technologies in the field. Thirdly, the article pays particular attention to the role of UN mandates affected by the ‘accountability-turn’; our research reveals such UN mandates now often sit at the heart of the ‘life cycle’ of information and evidence collected for justice and accountability purposes. In this section of the article, we also briefly discuss issues relating to third party control of information, in particular by social media companies. Finally, we discuss the need (and welcome initiative) to develop better international guidance and best practices for actors across the board in order to maximize the effective use of new technologies and digital evidence in international justice and accountability processes.","2021-09-13","2023-02-15 00:05:26","2023-02-15 05:16:31","2023-02-15 00:05:26","9-34","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most known solutions are based on the use of the principles of human gait created in nature during evolution. Modernbipedal robots are also based on the locomotion manners of birds. This review presents the current state of the art of bipedal walking robots based on natural bipedal movements (human and bird) as well as on innovative synthetic solutions. Firstly, an overview of the scientific analysis of human gait is provided as a basis for the design of bipedal robots. The full human gait cycle that consists of two main phases is analysed and the attention is paid to the problem of balance and stability, especially in the single support phase when the bipedal movement is unstable. The influences of passive or active gait on energy demand are also discussed. Most studies are explored based on the zero moment. Furthermore, a review of the knowledge on the specific locomotor characteristics of birds, whose kinematics are derived from dinosaurs and provide them with both walking and running abilities, is presented. Secondly, many types of bipedal robot solutions are reviewed, which include nature-inspired robots (human-like and birdlike robots) and innovative robots using new heuristic, synthetic ideas for locomotion. Totally 45 robotic solutions are gathered by thebibliographic search method. Atlas was mentioned as one of the most perfect human-like robots, while the birdlike robot cases were Cassie and Digit. Innovative robots are presented, such asslider robot without knees, robots with rotating feet (3 and 4 degrees of freedom), and the hybrid robot Leo, which can walk on surfaces and fly. In particular, the paper describes in detail the robots’ propulsion systems (electric, hydraulic), the structure of the lower limb (serial, parallel, mixed mechanisms), the types and structures of control and sensor systems, and the energy efficiency of the robots. Terrain roughness recognition systems using different sensor systems based on light detection and ranging or multiple cameras are introduced. A comparison of performance, control and sensor systems, drive systems, and achievements of known human-like and birdlike robots is provided. Thirdly, for the first time, the review comments on the future of bipedal robots in relation to the concepts of conventional (natural bipedal) and synthetic unconventional gait. We critically assess and compare prospective directions for further research that involve the development of navigation systems, artificial intelligence, collaboration with humans, areas for the development of bipedal robot applications in everyday life, therapy, and industry.","2022-06-12","2023-02-15 00:12:23","2023-02-15 05:16:26","2023-02-15 00:12:22","4440","","12","22","","Sensors","Recent Advances in Bipedal Walking Robots","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They offer open-source blueprints of the electric conversion kits globally. The authors analysed the CoP by considering its entire life cycle, starting from the motives for its establishment, through its active performance, up to the current stage, where the members need to decide whether the community will remain viable. Particular attention was paid to the group dynamics and issues that seemed relevant to the change in dynamics which determine whether a CoP maintains its vitality or dissipates.                                            Design/methodology/approach                The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy (Yin, 1984) to answer the research question and understand the target phenomenon of the CoP by analysing textual data. This particular case was chosen because of its unusual revelatory value for the case CoP which aims at creating a tangible innovation by using a platform that normally aims at intangible problem-solving (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). In the data collection, the authors used method and researcher triangulation (Patton, 1990).                                            Findings                Life cycle analysis revealed four themes that explained the change in the group dynamics and the dispersal of the community: differentiation and dispersal of interests, growth that resulted in role differentiation, virtuality in community development and inclusion of investors. The themes were all related to the fact that the case community operated with not only knowledge, but also with a tangible product. Therefore, the tangibility of a problem to be solved seems to play a pivotal role in a CoP’s operations and dynamics and, in part, also explains the changing role of information and communications technology (ICT) in the process.                                            Research limitations/implications                However, this paper identified also different ways to characterize community participation, which was also relevant from group dynamics point of view. Thus, the topic should be studied further. Group dynamics in general, as it relates to the success of CoPs, should be also investigated further. Additional studies should implement the inclusion of external resources in the community. Further research is also needed to investigate tangible and intangible outcomes achieved through CoPs. Much of the available research was conducted over short periods; prolonged interactions in a CoP context could show different results.                                            Practical implications                In conclusion, at the beginning of the life cycle of the eCars community, ICT played a significant role. It helped increase awareness of the community in the first place and enabled people to join in, which thus enabled the community to evolve. When the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became emphasized and much more important. In the maturing stage, the role of ICT, and especially social media, is the essential part of the community.                                            Social implications                This analysis suggests that at the early stage of a community, the plans can be somewhat random, even utopian, but when the community evolves, this uncertainty can become a problem. First, it affects achieving the actual, and in this case, concrete results. Second, uncertainty and unclarity dampen enthusiasm and motivation, which are of utmost importance due to the voluntary participation. This paper also concludes that when the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became increasingly important.                                            Originality/value                This paper argues that the ideological basis for this kind of community should be openness. All information should be available for everyone who registers to the community platform on the internet. This community was working in the mindset of open innovation. Technical documentation and all other material were available for everyone in the community’s wiki pages, which attracted a lot of people who were delighted by eCars. Many advisors delivered technical information and good advice to the practitioners of the community through the platform. The hang arounds were also very well-informed in this stage regarding how the core group was working.","2016-05-09","2023-02-14 23:50:51","2023-02-15 05:16:18","2023-02-14 23:50:51","465-483","","3","20","","JKM","Group dynamics and the role of ICT in the life cycle analysis of community of practice-based product development","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","closed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tilted particleboard allows testing without standing waves between the transmitter and the particleboard. This eliminates the need to evaluate several parallel planes and to search for values belonging to the tilted particleboard. The numerical requirements can be optimally exploited through a combination with a flaw detectability enhancement method. The results are supported by experiments on a wooden particleboard with flaw imitations. Finally, we showed, through a comparison with the usual procedure of identifying a flaw (calculating many parallel planes and then selecting the data belonging to the tilted plane), that the calculation of the tilted plane is up to 98.5% faster and improves the detectability of flaws in a tilted particleboard.","2020-11-28","2023-02-15 00:01:04","2023-02-15 05:16:17","2023-02-15 00:01:03","8513","","23","10","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet unresolved is whether the aggregated net effect of ICT overall mitigates or aggravates environmental burdens. While the savings potentials have been explored, drivers that prevent these and possible counter measures have not been researched thoroughly. The concept digital sufficiency constitutes a basis to understand how ICT can become part of the essential environmental transformation. Digital sufficiency consists of four dimensions, each suggesting a set of strategies and policy proposals: (a) hardware sufficiency, which aims for fewer devices needing to be produced and their absolute energy demand being kept to the lowest level possible to perform the desired tasks; (b) software sufficiency, which covers ensuring that data traffic and hardware utilization during application are kept as low as possible; (c) user sufficiency, which strives for users applying digital devices frugally and using ICT in a way that promotes sustainable lifestyles; and (d) economic sufficiency, which aspires to digitalization supporting a transition to an economy characterized not by economic growth as the primary goal but by sufficient production and consumption within planetary boundaries. The policies for hardware and software sufficiency are relatively easily conceivable and executable. Policies for user and economic sufficiency are politically more difficult to implement and relate strongly to policies for environmental transformation in general. This article argues for comprehensive policies for digital sufficiency, which are indispensible if ICT are to play a beneficial role in overall environmental transformation.","2022-05-12","2023-02-15 00:10:15","2023-02-15 05:16:15","2023-02-15 00:10:14","","","","","","Ann.

Proteins were grouped according to their molecular weight (MW), and a matrix was developed to assess only the significant correlations (p < 0.05) with the physical parameters. Two ML models were developed using the NIR (Model 1), and RoboBEER (Model 2) data as inputs to predict the relative quantification of 54 proteins. Proteins in the 0–20 kDa group were negatively correlated with the maximum volume of foam (MaxVol; r = −0.57) and total lifetime of foam (TLTF; r = −0.58), while those within 20–40 kDa had a positive correlation with MaxVol (r = 0.47) and TLTF (r = 0.47).

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has imposed unprecedented challenges to human society. It affects every aspect of livelihood, including health, environment, transportation, and economy. Open-source technologies provide a new ray of hope to collaboratively tackle the pandemic. The role of open source is not limited to sharing a source code. Rather open-source projects can be adopted as a software development approach to encourage collaboration among researchers. Open collaboration creates a positive impact in society and helps combat the pandemic effectively. Open-source technology integrated with geospatial information allows decision-makers to make strategic and informed decisions. It also assists them in determining the type of intervention needed based on geospatial information. The novelty of this paper is to standardize the open-source workflow for spatiotemporal research. The highlights of the open-source workflow include sharing data, analytical tools, spatiotemporal applications, and results and formalizing open-source software development. The workflow includes (i) developing open-source spatiotemporal applications, (ii) opening and sharing the spatiotemporal resources, and (iii) replicating the research in a plug and play fashion. Open data, open analytical tools and source code, and publicly accessible results form the foundation for this workflow. This paper also presents a case study with the open-source spatiotemporal application development for air quality analysis in California, USA.

Lunar farside exploration is challenging because maneuvering rovers with efficient locomotion in harsh extraterrestrial environment is necessary to explore geological characteristics of scientific interest. Chang’E-4 mission successfully targeted the Moon’s farside and deployed a teleoperated rover (Yutu-2) to explore inside the Von Kármán crater, conveying rich information regarding regolith, craters, and rocks. Here, we report mobile exploration on the lunar farside with Yutu-2 over the initial 2 years. During its journey, Yutu-2 has experienced varying degrees of mild slip and skid, indicating that the terrain is relatively flat at large scales but scattered with local gentle slopes. Cloddy soil sticking on its wheels implies a greater cohesion of the lunar soil than encountered at other lunar landing sites. Further identification results indicate that the regolith resembles dry sand and sandy loam on Earth in bearing properties, demonstrating greater bearing strength than that identified during the Apollo missions. In sharp contrast to the sparsity of rocks along the traverse route, small fresh craters with unilateral moldable ejecta are abundant, and some of them contain high-reflectance materials at the bottom, suggestive of secondary impact events. These findings hint at notable differences in the surface geology between the lunar farside and nearside. Experience gained with Yutu-2 improves the understanding of the farside of the Moon, which, in return, may lead to locomotion with improved efficiency and larger range.            ,               Yutu-2 conducted in situ exploration on the lunar farside, yielding insights into lunar regolith, craters, and rocks.","2022-01-19","2023-02-15 00:15:30","2023-02-15 05:16:00","2023-02-15 00:15:29","eabj6660","","62","7","","Sci.

Suicidal ideation detection via online social network analysis has emerged as an essential research topic with significant difficulties in the fields of NLP and psychology in recent years. With the proper exploitation of the information in social media, the complicated early symptoms of suicidal ideations can be discovered and hence, it can save many lives. This study offers a comparative analysis of multiple machine learning and deep learning models to identify suicidal thoughts from the social media platform Twitter. The principal purpose of our research is to achieve better model performance than prior research works to recognize early indications with high accuracy and avoid suicide attempts. We applied text pre-processing and feature extraction approaches such as CountVectorizer and word embedding, and trained several machine learning and deep learning models for such a goal. Experiments were conducted on a dataset of 49,178 instances retrieved from live tweets by 18 suicidal and non-suicidal keywords using Python Tweepy API. Our experimental findings reveal that the RF model can achieve the highest classification score among machine learning algorithms, with an accuracy of 93% and an F1 score of 0.92. However, training the deep learning classifiers with word embedding increases the performance of ML models, where the BiLSTM model reaches an accuracy of 93.6% and a 0.93 F1 score.","2022-04-29","2023-02-15 00:15:44","2023-02-15 00:15:44","2023-02-15 00:15:43","57","","3","10","","Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Up to eight DEMs (ALOS Palsar, Aster GDEM, Bare Earth DEM, SRTM DEM, Merit DEM, TanDEM-X DEM, NASA DEM, and Copernicus DEM) of different data acquisition, spatial resolution, and data processing were used to reconstruct the January 2015 flood event. The systematic flow rate record from the Mocuba city gauge station as well as international aid organisms and field data were used to define both the return period peak flows in years for different flood frequencies (Tyear) and the January 2015 flooding event peak flow. Both visual and statistical analysis of flow depth values at control point locations give us a measure of the different hydraulic modelling performance. The results related to the Copernicus DEM, both in visual and statistical approach, show a clear improvement over the results of the other free global DEMs. Under the assumption that Copernicus DEM provides the best results, a flood hazard analysis was carried out, its results being in agreement with previous data of the effects of the January 2015 flooding event in the Mocuba District. All these results highlight the step forward that Copernicus DEM represents for flood hazard analysis in developing countries, along with the use of so-called “citizen science” in the form of flooding evidence field data acquisition.","2022-01-10","2023-02-15 00:15:37","2023-02-15 00:15:37","2023-02-15 00:15:36","176","","2","14","","Water","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The limited classes of structures and materials that can be used in such robots, however, create challenges in achieving desired performance parameters and modes of operation. Here, we introduce approaches in manufacturing and actuation that address these constraints to enable untethered, terrestrial robots with complex, three-dimensional (3D) geometries and heterogeneous material construction. The manufacturing procedure exploits controlled mechanical buckling to create 3D multimaterial structures in layouts that range from arrays of filaments and origami constructs to biomimetic configurations and others. A balance of forces associated with a one-way shape memory alloy and the elastic resilience of an encapsulating shell provides the basis for reversible deformations of these structures. Modes of locomotion and manipulation span from bending, twisting, and expansion upon global heating to linear/curvilinear crawling, walking, turning, and jumping upon laser-induced local thermal actuation. Photonic structures such as retroreflectors and colorimetric sensing materials support simple forms of wireless monitoring and localization. These collective advances in materials, manufacturing, actuation, and sensing add to a growing body of capabilities in this emerging field of technology.            ,               Submillimeter-scale robots developed from shape memory alloys can be actuated by a laser to permit terrestrial locomotion.","2022-05-25","2023-02-15 00:15:18","2023-02-15 00:15:18","2023-02-15 00:15:18","eabn0602","","66","7","","Sci.

Their high-speed (15 to 23 micrometer per second; 9.5 ± 5.4 body lengths per second) swimming in multicomponent ionic solutions with concentrations up to 5 M and without dedicated fuels is demonstrated, overcoming one of the bottlenecks of previous light-driven microswimmers. Such high ion tolerance is attributed to a favorable interplay between the particle’s textural and structural nanoporosity and optoionic properties, facilitating ionic interactions in solutions with high salinity. Biocompatibility of these microswimmers is validated by cell viability tests with three different cell lines and primary cells. The nanopores of the swimmers are loaded with a model cancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), resulting in a high (185%) loading efficiency without passive release. Controlled drug release is reported under different pH conditions and can be triggered on-demand by illumination. Light-triggered, boosted release of DOX and its active degradation products are demonstrated under oxygen-poor conditions using the intrinsic, environmentally sensitive and light-induced charge storage properties of PHI, which could enable future theranostic applications in oxygen-deprived tumor regions. These organic PHI microswimmers simultaneously address the current light-driven microswimmer challenges of high ion tolerance, fuel-free high-speed propulsion in biological media, biocompatibility, and controlled on-demand cargo release toward their biomedical, environmental, and other potential applications.            ,               Biocompatible microswimmers show light-controlled swimming in ionic and biological media with responsive drug release.","2022-01-19","2023-02-15 00:15:14","2023-02-15 00:15:14","2023-02-15 00:15:14","eabm1421","","62","7","","Sci.

This functional organization changes in the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the heterogeneous nature of autism brings inconsistency in the findings, and specific pattern of changes based on the cognitive theories of ASD still requires to be well-understood. In this study, we hypothesized that the theory of mind (ToM), and the weak central coherence theory must follow an alteration pattern in the network level of functional interactions. The main aim is to understand this pattern by evaluating interactions between all the brain functional networks. Moreover, the association between the significantly altered interactions and cognitive dysfunctions in autism is also investigated. We used resting-state fMRI data of 106 subjects (5–14 years, 46 ASD: five female, 60 HC: 18 female) to define the brain functional networks. Functional networks were calculated by applying four parcellation masks and their interactions were estimated using Pearson's correlation between pairs of them. Subsequently, for each mask, a graph was formed based on the connectome of interactions. Then, the local and global parameters of the graph were calculated. Finally, statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample                t                -test to highlight the significant differences between autistic and healthy control groups. Our corrected results show significant changes in the interaction of default mode, sensorimotor, visuospatial, visual, and language networks with other functional networks that can support the main cognitive theories of autism. We hope this finding sheds light on a better understanding of the neural underpinning of autism.","2022-10-06","2023-02-15 00:15:11","2023-02-15 00:15:11","2023-02-15 00:15:10","828985","","","16","","Front.

In the same area, a significant number of studies have been conducted in identifying or classifying upper-limb movement intentions. On the contrary, few works have been concerned with movement intention identification for lower limbs. Notwithstanding, lower-limb neurorehabilitation is a major topic in medical settings, as some people suffer from mobility problems in their lower limbs, such as those diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, and people with hemiplegia or quadriplegia. Particularly, the conventional pattern recognition (PR) systems are one of the most suitable computational tools for electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis as the explicit knowledge of the features involved in the PR process itself is crucial for both improving signal classification performance and providing more interpretability. In this regard, there is a real need for outline and comparative studies gathering benchmark and state-of-art PR techniques that allow for a deeper understanding thereof and a proper selection of a specific technique. This study conducted a topical overview of specialized papers covering lower-limb motor task identification through PR-based BCI/EEG signal analysis systems. To do so, we first established search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria to find the most relevant papers on the subject. As a result, we identified the 22 most relevant papers. Next, we reviewed their experimental methodologies for recording EEG signals during the execution of lower limb tasks. In addition, we review the algorithms used in the preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification stages. Finally, we compared all the algorithms and determined which of them are the most suitable in terms of accuracy.","2022-03-04","2023-02-15 00:14:59","2023-02-15 00:14:59","2023-02-15 00:14:58","2028","","5","22","","Sensors","Identification of Lower-Limb Motor Tasks via Brain–Computer Interfaces","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a reference, a hydrophone array was deployed alongside the glider and buoy at a shallow-water site southwest of Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts, USA) over a four-week period in spring 2017. A call-by-call comparison between North Atlantic right whale upcalls localized with the array (n = 541) and those detected by the glider or buoy was used to estimate the detection function for each DMON/LFDCS platform. The probability of detection was influenced by range, ambient noise level, platform depth, detection process, review protocol, and calling rate. The conservative analysis of near real-time pitch tracks suggested that, under typical conditions, a 0.33 probability of detection of a single call occurred at 6.2 km for the buoy and 8.6–13.4 km for the glider (depending on glider depth), while a 0.10 probability of detection of a single call occurred at 14.4 m for the buoy and 22.6–27.5 km for the glider.

However, as outsiders, emergent citizen groups responding to the dire shortage of personal protective equipment at the onset of COVID-19 lacked local knowledge and legitimacy. In this study, we examine how entrepreneurial citizens mobilized collective resources in attempts to gain acceptance and meet local needs amid the urgency of the pandemic. Through longitudinal case studies of citizen groups connected to makerspaces in four U.S. cities, we study how they adapted to address the resource and legitimacy limitations they encountered. We identify three mechanisms—augmenting, circumventing, and attenuating—that helped transient citizen groups calibrate their resource mobilization based on what they learned over time. We highlight how extreme temporality imposes limits on resourcefulness and legitimation, making it critical for collective entrepreneurs to learn when to work within their limitations rather than try to overcome them.","2022-10-14","2023-02-15 00:14:21","2023-02-15 00:14:21","2023-02-15 00:14:21","104225872211202","","","","","Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice","Pandemic Makers","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the conventional 3D cell culture method has limitations such as difficulty in using an extracellular matrix (ECM), low experimental reproducibility, complex 3D cell culture protocol, and difficulty in applying to high array plates such as 96- or 384-plates. Therefore, detailed protocols related to robust 3D-aggregated spheroid model (3D-ASM) production were optimized and proposed. A specially designed wet chamber was used to implement 3D-ASM using the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, and the conditions were established for the icing step to aggregate the cells in one place and optimized ECM gelation step. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining is mainly used to simultaneously analyze drug efficacy and changes in drug-target biomarkers. By applying the IF staining method to the 3D-ASM model, confocal microscopy imaging and 3D deconvolution image analysis were also successfully performed. Through a comparative study of drug response with conventional 2D-high throughput screening (HTS), the 3D-HTS showed a more comprehensive range of drug efficacy analyses for HCC cell lines and enabled selective drug efficacy analysis for the FDA-approved drug sorafenib. This suggests that increased drug resistance under 3D-HTS conditions does not reduce the analytical discrimination of drug efficacy, also drug efficacy can be analyzed more selectively compared to the conventional 2D-HTS assay. Therefore, the 3D-HTS-based drug efficacy analysis method using an automated 3D-cell spotter/scanner, 384-pillar plate/wet chamber, and the proposed 3D-ASM fabrication protocol is a very suitable platform for analyzing target drug efficacy in HCC cells.","2022-11-07","2023-02-15 00:14:17","2023-02-15 00:14:17","2023-02-15 00:14:17","18937","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autonomous anastomosis is a challenging soft-tissue surgery task because it requires intricate imaging, tissue tracking, and surgical planning techniques, as well as a precise execution via highly adaptable control strategies often in unstructured and deformable environments. In the laparoscopic setting, such surgeries are even more challenging because of the need for high maneuverability and repeatability under motion and vision constraints. Here we describe an enhanced autonomous strategy for laparoscopic soft tissue surgery and demonstrate robotic laparoscopic small bowel anastomosis in phantom and in vivo intestinal tissues. This enhanced autonomous strategy allows the operator to select among autonomously generated surgical plans and the robot executes a wide range of tasks independently. We then use our enhanced autonomous strategy to perform in vivo autonomous robotic laparoscopic surgery for intestinal anastomosis on porcine models over a 1-week survival period. We compared the anastomosis quality criteria—including needle placement corrections, suture spacing, suture bite size, completion time, lumen patency, and leak pressure—of the developed autonomous system, manual laparoscopic surgery, and robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Data from a phantom model indicate that our system outperforms expert surgeons’ manual technique and RAS technique in terms of consistency and accuracy. This was also replicated in the in vivo model. These results demonstrate that surgical robots exhibiting high levels of autonomy have the potential to improve consistency, patient outcomes, and access to a standard surgical technique.            ,               An autonomous robotic strategy allows laparoscopic soft tissue surgery in end-to-end anastomosis of the small bowel.","2022-01-26","2023-02-15 00:13:58","2023-02-15 00:13:58","2023-02-15 00:13:57","eabj2908","","62","7","","Sci.

However, high-resolution tactile skins are not widely available; this is due to the large size of robust sensing units and because many units typically lead to fragility in wiring and to high costs. One route toward high-resolution and robust tactile skins involves the embedding of a few sensor units (taxels) into a flexible surface material and the use of signal processing to achieve sensing with superresolution accuracy. Here, we propose a theory for geometric superresolution to guide the development of tactile sensors of this kind and link it to machine learning techniques for signal processing. This theory is based on sensor isolines and allows us to compute the possible force sensitivity and accuracy in contact position and force magnitude as a spatial quantity before building a sensor. We evaluate the influence of different factors, such as elastic properties of the material, structure design, and transduction methods, using finite element simulations and by implementing real sensors. We empirically determine sensor isolines and validate the theory in two custom-built sensors with 1D and 2D measurement surfaces that use barometric units. Using machine learning methods to infer contact information, our sensors obtain an average superresolution factor of over 100 and 1200, respectively. Our theory can guide future tactile sensor designs and inform various design choices.            ,               We propose a theory using taxel value isolines to guide superresolution tactile sensor design and evaluate it empirically.","2022-02-23","2023-02-15 00:13:51","2023-02-15 00:13:51","2023-02-15 00:13:50","eabm0608","","63","7","","Sci.

Behavioral differences can affect the performance of directional algorithms in hearing aids, as was shown in previous work by using head movement trajectories of normal-hearing (NH) listeners in acoustic simulations for noise-suppression performance predictions. However, the movement behavior of hearing-impaired (HI) listeners with or without hearing aids may differ, and hearing-aid users might adapt their self-motion to improve the performance of directional algorithms. This work investigates the influence of hearing impairment on self-motion, and the interaction of hearing aids with self-motion. In order to do this, the self-motion of three HI participant groups­­­—aided with an adaptive differential microphone (ADM), aided without ADM, and unaided—was measured and compared to previously measured self-motion data from younger and older NH participants. Self-motion was measured in virtual audiovisual environments (VEs) in the laboratory, and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and SNR improvement of the ADM resulting from the head movements of the participants were estimated using acoustic simulations. HI participants did almost all of the movement with their head and less with their eyes compared to NH participants, which led to a 0.3 dB increase in estimated SNR and to differences in estimated SNR improvement of the ADM. However, the self-motion of the HI participants aided with ADM was similar to that of other HI participants, indicating that the ADM did not cause listeners to adapt their self-motion.","2022-01","2023-02-15 00:13:47","2023-02-15 00:13:47","2023-02-15 00:13:47","233121652210787","","","26","","Trends in Hearing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electricity harvesting based on solar or wind energies is also discussed to gather more power from nature. Pros and cons in strategies of energy management, which are valuable tools to enhance power utilization efficiency, are elaborated. This article is hoped to provide researchers in long-term robotic sailing with a comprehensive reference from the perspectives of energy.","2022-01-05","2023-02-15 00:13:26","2023-02-15 00:13:26","2023-02-15 00:13:26","787253","","","8","","Front.

However, existing consumer focused SLA 3D printers struggle to fabricate functional microfluidic devices due to several challenges associated with micron-scale 3D printing. Here, we explore the origins and mechanism of the associated failure modes followed by presenting guidelines to overcome these challenges. The prescribed method works completely with existing consumer class inexpensive SLA printers without any modifications to reliably print PDMS cast microfluidic channels with channel sizes as low as ~75 μm and embedded channels with channel sizes as low ~200 μm. We developed a custom multi-resin formulation by incorporating Polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and Ethylene glycol polyether acrylate (EGPEA) as the monomer units to achieve micron sized printed features with tunable mechanical and optical properties. By incorporating multiple resins with different mechanical properties, we were able to achieve spatial control over the stiffness of the cured resin enabling us to incorporate both flexible and rigid components within a single 3D printed microfluidic chip. We demonstrate the utility of this technique by 3D printing an integrated pressure-actuated pneumatic valve (with flexible cured resin) in an otherwise rigid and clear microfluidic device that can be fabricated in a one-step process from a single CAD file. We also demonstrate the utility of this technique by integrating a fully functional finger-actuated microfluidic pump. The versatility and accessibility of the demonstrated fabrication method have the potential to reduce our reliance on expensive and time-consuming photolithographic techniques for microfluidic chip fabrication and thus drastically lowering our barrier to entry in microfluidics research.","2022-08-17","2023-02-15 00:13:23","2023-02-15 00:13:23","2023-02-15 00:13:23","652","","8","12","","Biosensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The extensible and configurable simulator is helpful for system-level exploration of u-architecture, as well as operator optimization algorithm developments. The simulator is a functional simulator that simulates the latencies of calculation and memory access and the concurrent process between modules, and it gives the number of program execution cycles after the simulation is completed.

Furthermore, as it is a developing field of study, its location on campus facilitates research, maintenance, and financing. In this scenario, a SCADA system is proposed, capable of monitoring and centrally storing the values of the most important production and consumption parameters. In addition, by using this system, it is possible to control the state of the different energy sources in a centralized way, as well as their distribution in the plant where it is implemented.

Before the journal's launch in July 2012, the editors aimed to make publishing more than a narrative presentation of work already done into a fully open process. Major milestones include creating our own data repository, embracing FAIR principles, promoting and integrating preprints, and working with other platforms to contribute to a 21st century publishing infrastructure. Almost 10 years after GigaScience’s launch, UNESCO published its Open Science Recommendations. With these in mind, looking back, we are happy to have contributed in various ways to UNESCO's aim to “foster a culture of Open Science and aligning incentives for Open Science” from the very beginning, and, more, to use those recommendations to guide our path into the future: to truly embrace the full spectrum of information, tools, and access to Open Science for all participants in scientific endeavours.","2022-07-12","2023-02-15 00:07:37","2023-02-15 00:07:37","2023-02-15 00:07:36","giac067","","","11","","","A Decade of <i>GigaScience</i>","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A rapidly growing approach to reduce the costs of scientific equipment is to combine open-source hardware methods with digital distributed manufacturing with 3D printers. Although high-end 3D printers can manufacture vacuum components, again, the cost of access to tooling is economically prohibitive. Low-cost material extrusion 3D printing with plastic overcomes the cost issue, but two problems arise when attempting to use plastic in or as part of vacuum systems: the outgassing of polymers and their sealing. To overcome these challenges, this study explores the potential of using post-processing heat treatments to seal 3D printed polypropylene for use in vacuum environments. The effect of infill overlap and heat treatment with a readily available heat gun on 3D printed PP parts was investigated in detail on ISO-standardized KF vacuum fitting parts and with the use of computer vision-based monitoring of vacuum pump down velocities. The results showed that infill overlap and heat treatment both had a large impact on the vacuum pressures obtainable with 3D printed parts. Heat treatment combined with 98% infill reliably sealed parts for use in vacuum systems, which makes the use of low-cost desktop 3D printers viable for manufacturing vacuum components for open scientific hardware.","2022-09-08","2023-02-15 00:07:33","2023-02-15 00:07:33","2023-02-15 00:07:32","98","","5","6","","JMMP","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This trend has increased attention to open source hardware (OSH): a phenomenon that extends the intellectual property management and development practices in open source software (OSS) into the design of physical objects. OSH projects are different from OSS projects due to product type, and distinct from traditional closed source new product development (NPD) ones due to their openness. These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation – the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output – the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process – activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management. While our study confirms a similarity between OSS and OSH in defining project success, it also highlights themes that are uniquely important to the latter. These findings are helpful for OSH development practice and could provide lessons for OSS development and closed source NPD.","2022","2023-02-15 00:07:15","2023-02-15 00:07:15","2023-02-15 00:07:15","e8","","","8","","Des.

However, with respect to other vertebrates, fish are relatively underrepresented in psychological and cognitive research. A greater availability of easily accessible, flexible, open-source experimental platforms that facilitate the automation of task control and data acquisition may help to reduce this bias and improve the scalability and refinement of behavioural experiments in a range of different fish species. Here we present                GoFish,                a fully automated platform for behavioural experiments in aquatic species.                GoFish                includes real-time video tracking of subjects, presentation of stimuli in a computer screen, an automatic feeder device, and closed-loop control of task contingencies and data acquisition. The design and software components of the platform are freely available, while the hardware is open-source and relatively inexpensive. The control software,                Bonsai                , is designed to facilitate rapid development of task workflows and is supported by a growing community of users.

Low-cost sensors open the possibility of monitoring storm and waste water systems at a much greater spatial and temporal resolution without prohibitive costs and resource investment. To aid in this, this work developed a low-cost, low-power velocity sensor based on acoustic Doppler velocimetry. The sensor, costing less than 50 USD is open-source, open-hardware, compact, and easily interfaceable to a wide range of data-logging systems. A freely available sensor design at this price point does not currently exist, and its novelty is in enabling high-resolution real-time monitoring schemes. The design is capable of measuring water velocities up to 1200 mm/s. The sensor is characterised and then verified in an in-field long-term test. Finally, the data from this test are then used to evaluate the performance of the sensor in a real-world scenario.

This ability requires the nervous system to undergo adjustments at distinct temporal scales, from short-term dynamic changes in expression of neurotransmitters and receptors to longer-term growth, spatial and connectivity reorganization, while integrating external stimuli. The nematode                  Caenorhabditis elegans                  provides a model of nervous system plasticity, in particular its dauer exit decision. Under unfavorable conditions, larvae will enter the non-feeding and non-reproductive stress-resistant dauer stage and adapt their behavior to cope with the harsh new environment, with active reversal under improved conditions leading to resumption of reproductive development. However, how different environmental stimuli regulate the exit decision mechanism and thereby drive the larva’s behavioral change is unknown. To fill this gap and provide insights on behavioral changes over extended periods of time, we developed a new open hardware method for long-term imaging (12h) of                  C. elegans                  larvae.                                                            Results                Our WormObserver platform comprises open hardware and software components for video acquisition, automated processing of large image data (> 80k images/experiment) and data analysis. We identified dauer-specific behavioral motifs and characterized the behavioral trajectory of dauer exit in different environments and genetic backgrounds to identify key decision points and stimuli promoting dauer exit. Combining long-term behavioral imaging with transcriptomics data, we find that bacterial ingestion triggers a change in neuropeptide gene expression to establish post-dauer behavior.                                            Conclusions                                  Taken together, we show how a developing nervous system can robustly integrate environmental changes activate a developmental switch and adapt the organism’s behavior to a new environment. WormObserver is generally applicable to other research questions within and beyond the                  C. elegans                  field, having a modular and customizable character and allowing assessment of behavioral plasticity over longer periods.","2022-12-13","2023-02-15 00:06:34","2023-02-15 00:06:34","2023-02-15 00:06:33","277","","1","20","","BMC Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lack of reliable quality management tools has impeded repository development in the past several decades. Microfabricated open-hardware devices have emerged as a new approach to assist repository development by providing standardized quality assessment capabilities to enable routine quality control. However, prototyping of microfabricated devices (microdevices) traditionally relies on photolithography techniques that are costly, time intensive, and accessible only through specialized engineering laboratories. Although resin 3-D printing has been introduced into the microfabrication domain, existing publications focus on customized or high-cost (>thousands of USD) printers. The goal of this report was to identify and call attention to the emerging opportunities to support innovation in microfabrication by use of low-cost (<USD 350) resin 3-D printing for rapid prototyping. We demonstrate that low-cost mask-based stereolithography (MSLA) 3-D printers with straightforward modifications can provide fabrication quality that approaches traditional photolithography techniques. For example, reliable feature sizes of 20 µm with dimensional discrepancy of <4% for lateral dimensions and <5% for vertical dimensions were fabricated with a consumer-level MSLA printers. In addition, alterations made to pre-processing, post-processing, and printer configuration steps improved print quality as demonstrated in objects with sharper edges and smoother surfaces. The prototyping time and cost of resin 3-D printing (3 h with USD 0.5/prototype) were considerably lower than those of traditional photolithography (5 d with USD 80/prototype). With the rapid advance of consumer-grade printers, resin 3-D printing can revolutionize rapid prototyping approaches for microdevices in the near future, facilitating participation in interdisciplinary development of innovative hardware to support germplasm repository development for aquatic species.","2022-02-15","2023-02-15 00:06:31","2023-02-15 00:06:31","2023-02-15 00:06:31","49","","1","7","","Fishes","Low-Cost Resin 3-D Printing for Rapid Prototyping of Microdevices","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The instrument has been designed to allow transient absorption spectroscopy measurements of either low or high quantum yield processes by combining intense sub-microsecond excitation flashes using a xenon lamp together with stroboscopic non-actinic white light probing using LED sources driven under high pulsed current from a capacitor bank. The instrument is sensitive to resolve 0.15 mOD flash-induced differences within 1000 measurements at 20 Hz repetition rate using an inexpensive CCD sensor with 200 μm pixel dimension, 40 K electrons full well capacity and a dynamic range of 1800.

Initially designed to appeal to electronic hobbyists, open electronics have formed a global “maker” community and are increasingly used in science and industry. In this perspective article, we review the current costs and benefits of open electronics for use in scientific research ranging from the experimental to the theoretical sciences. We discuss how user-made electronic applications can help (I) individual researchers, by increasing the customization, efficiency, and scalability of experiments, while improving data quantity and quality; (II) scientific institutions, by improving access to customizable high-end technologies, sustainability, visibility, and interdisciplinary collaboration potential; and (III) the scientific community, by improving transparency and reproducibility, helping decouple research capacity from funding, increasing innovation, and improving collaboration potential among researchers and the public. We further discuss how current barriers like poor awareness, knowledge access, and time investments can be resolved by increased documentation and collaboration, and provide guidelines for academics to enter this emerging field. We highlight that open electronics are a promising and powerful tool to help scientific research to become more innovative and reproducible and offer a key practical solution to improve democratic access to science.","2022-10-29","2023-02-15 00:06:15","2023-02-15 00:06:15","2023-02-15 00:06:15","1061-1075","","4","62","","","Open Hardware in Science","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a modular hardware platform allowing to prototype, test and even implement IoT appliances on low-cost reconfigurable devices is presented. The proposed platform, named Dracon, includes a Z80-clone microprocessor, up to 64 KB of RAM, and 256 inputs/outputs (I/Os). These I/Os can be used to connect additional co-processors within the same FPGA, external co-processors, communications modules, sensors and actuators. Dracon also includes as default peripherals a UART for programming and accessing the microprocessor, a Real Time Clock, and an Interrupt Timer. The use of an 8-bit microprocessor allows the use of the internal memory of the reconfigurable device as program memory, thereby, enabling the implementation of a complete IoT device within a single low-cost chip. Indeed, results using a Spartan 7 FPGA show that it is possible to implement Dracon with only 1515 6-input LUTs while operating at a maximum frequency of 80 MHz, which results in a better trade-off in terms of area and performance than other less powerful and less versatile alternatives in the literature. Moreover, the presented platform allows the development of embedded software applications independently of the selected FPGA device, enabling rapid prototyping and implementations on devices from different manufacturers.","2022-07-02","2023-02-15 00:06:12","2023-02-15 00:06:12","2023-02-15 00:06:12","2080","","13","11","","Electronics","Dracon","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article reviews the opportunity to use FOSH as a sanction to undercut imports and exports from a target criminal country. A formal methodology is presented for selecting strategic national investments in FOSH development to improve both national security and global safety. In this methodology, first the target country that is threatening national security or safety is identified. Next, the top imports from the target country as well as potentially other importing countries (allies) are quantified. Hardware is identified that could undercut imports/exports from the target country. Finally, methods to support the FOSH development are enumerated to support production in a commons-based peer production strategy. To demonstrate how this theoretical method works in practice, it is applied as a case study to a current criminal military aggressor nation, who is also a fossil-fuel exporter. The results show that there are numerous existing FOSH and opportunities to develop new FOSH for energy conservation and renewable energy to reduce fossil-fuel-energy demand. Widespread deployment would reduce the concomitant pollution, human health impacts, and environmental desecration as well as cut financing of military operations.","2022-04-18","2023-02-15 00:06:09","2023-02-15 00:06:09","2023-02-15 00:06:09","53","","2","10","","Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is completely open source and open hardware and supports both model-based and neural network–based controllers. Also, it provides high thrust-to-weight and torque-to-inertia ratios for agility, onboard vision sensors, graphics processing unit (GPU)–accelerated compute hardware for real-time perception and neural network inference, a real-time flight controller, and a versatile software stack. In contrast to existing frameworks, Agilicious offers a unique combination of flexible software stack and high-performance hardware. We compare Agilicious with prior works and demonstrate it on different agile tasks, using both model-based and neural network–based controllers. Our demonstrators include trajectory tracking at up to 5                g                and 70 kilometers per hour in a motion capture system, and vision-based acrobatic flight and obstacle avoidance in both structured and unstructured environments using solely onboard perception.

Double-sided (bifacial) panels are gaining increasing popularity in commercial applications due to the increased energy yield with a constant occupied mounting surface. However, the value of the additional energy yield produced by the back of the panel depends on several important factors. This paper presents the influence of working conditions on electricity generation in bifacial modules. This paper also investigates the influence of weather conditions, the module inclination angle, and the substrate beneath the panel surface on electricity generation. Fill factor and efficiency were calculated for each case included in the study scope. Based on the current voltage, power characteristics, and calculations, the module operation for different conditions was compared. It was observed that the optimal inclination angle to the surface is higher for the bifacial modules compared to the unilateral modules. The type of surface under the module has also been indicated to impact the amount of electricity generated. The additional energy yield associated with the panels’ rear side accounts for 2% to more than 35% of the total power generated by a photovoltaic (PV) module. The unit cost of electricity generation in the analyzed cases was also determined.","2021-08-13","2023-02-15 00:05:46","2023-02-15 00:05:46","2023-02-15 00:05:45","4964","","16","14","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying the authenticity of the data submitted by the nodes is the top priority. We propose a scheme to verify the authenticity of multinode data. In this scheme, the authenticity of node data is checked through visual secret recovery and XOR operation together. The least significant bit (lsb) operation converts data from nodes into a bit, which improves the efficiency of data verification and reduces the risk of data leakage. This scheme achieves the purpose of verifying the data provided by the node, which avoids malicious attacks from illegal nodes.

Still, much work has to be completed to turn anaerobic digestion modelling into a reliable and practical tool. Indeed, the complex biochemical processes described in the ADM1 model require the identification of several parameters and many analytical determinations for substrate characterization. A combined protocol including batch Biochemical Methane Potential tests and analytical determinations is proposed and applied for substrate influent characterization to simulate a pilot-scale anaerobic digester where co-digestion of waste sludge and expired yogurt was operated. An iterative procedure was also developed to improve the fit of batch tests for kinetic parameter identification. The results are encouraging: the iterative procedure significantly reduced the Theil’s Inequality Coefficient (TIC), used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model for alkalinity, total volatile fatty acids, pH, COD, volatile solids, and ammoniacal nitrogen.

This paper focuses on how and why electrically-assisted bikes make a difference to cycling in hilly contexts, and can thus be an important element of sustainable mobility in hilly geographies. It makes a novel contribution in being able to draw on recorded sensor data of the actual use of assistance in relation to the specific geography of the route cycled (GPS data), and interview/survey material. It shows that e-bikes extend the range, nature and scope of journeys manageable by bike, and therefore the general viability of e-bikes as alternative to other modes. It highlights that the benefits of using e-bikes are often also psychological, since they can change the overall enjoyability of the cycling experience in hilly areas. Resulting policy recommendations, that could lead to significant CO2 savings through the uptake of e-cycling in hilly contexts, include ‘try before you buy’ schemes, training for e-bike users and investing in relevant cycling infrastructure.","2021-08-10","2023-02-15 00:05:19","2023-02-15 00:05:19","2023-02-15 00:05:18","8946","","16","13","","Sustainability","Impact of E-Bikes on Cycling in Hilly Areas","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed a set of DHS for digital innovation (DHS10). There are numerous studies on DHS impacts/outcomes in the recent years. However, little research has been conducted to identify whether DHS has lasting benefits on designers’ ideation performance. This paper explores whether DHS10 can help designers achieve more creative ideas based on different design briefs, and if DHS has lasting impacts on or benefits for students. An empirical study was conducted with two groups (i.e., 32 students who learned DHS10 five weeks ago, and 24 students who studied DHS10 instantly). They were asked to address an open-ended design brief on COVID-19 and generate as many innovative ideas as possible. The results suggest DHS has impacts on students who learned DHS just now and five weeks ago. The effect is stronger on those who just learned DHS10. We suggest that DHS10 be provided for ideation as it provides texts and visual stimuli for designers. DHS10 also has the potential to help students understand digital innovation and generate ideas accordingly.","2021-05-28","2023-02-15 00:05:16","2023-02-15 00:05:16","2023-02-15 00:05:16","6103","","11","13","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, inspired by pedestrian behavior, swarm robotic pedestrian behavior (SRPB) was proposed. It considered many realistic constraints in the multi-target search problem, including limited communication range, limited working time, unknown sources, unknown extrema, the arbitrary initial location of robots, non-oriented search, and no central coordination. The performance of different cooperative strategies was evaluated in terms of average time to find the first, the half, and the last source, the number of located sources and the collision rate. Several experiments with different target signals, fixed initial location, arbitrary initial location, different population sizes, and the different number of targets were implemented. It was demonstrated by numerous experiments that SRPB had excellent stability, quick source seeking, a high number of located sources, and a low collision rate in various search strategies.","2020-03-13","2023-02-15 00:05:08","2023-02-15 00:05:08","2023-02-15 00:05:07","1606","","6","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is due to a number of breakthroughs in the medical field and the need for big data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT) to be incorporated in a real-time smart health information management system. In addition, the requirements of patient care have evolved over time, allowing for more accurate prognoses and diagnoses. In this paper, we discuss the temporal evolution of health data management systems and capture the requirements that led to the development of a given system over a certain period of time. Consequently, we provide insights into those systems and give suggestions and research directions on how they can be improved for a better health care system.                                            Objective                This study aimed to show that there is a need for a secure and efficient health data management system that will allow physicians and patients to update decentralized medical records and to analyze the medical data for supporting more precise diagnoses, prognoses, and public insights. Limitations of existing health data management systems were analyzed.                                            Methods                To study the evolution and requirements of health data management systems over the years, a search was conducted to obtain research articles and information on medical lawsuits, health regulations, and acts. These materials were obtained from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Association for Computing Machinery, Elsevier, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.                                            Results                Health data management systems have undergone a disruptive transformation over the years from paper to computer, web, cloud, IoT, big data analytics, and finally to blockchain. The requirements of a health data management system revealed from the evolving definitions of medical records and their management are (1) medical record data, (2) real-time data access, (3) patient participation, (4) data sharing, (5) data security, (6) patient identity privacy, and (7) public insights. This paper reviewed health data management systems based on these 7 requirements across studies conducted over the years. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the temporal evolution of health data management systems giving insights into the system requirements for better health care.                                            Conclusions                There is a need for a comprehensive real-time health data management system that allows physicians, patients, and external users to input their medical and lifestyle data into the system. The incorporation of big data analytics will aid in better prognosis or diagnosis of the diseases and the prediction of diseases.

The advances on metering technology and low-cost devices make it possible to form a submetering network, which measures the main supply and other intermediate points providing information of the behavior of different areas. However, an analysis by means of classical techniques can lead to wrong conclusions if the load is not balanced. This paper proposes the use of a deep convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct the whole consumption measured by the submeters using the learnt features in order to analyze the behavior of different building areas. The display of weights and information of the latent space provided by the autoencoder allows us to obtain precise details of the influence of each area in the whole building consumption and its dependence on external factors such as temperature. A submetering network is deployed in the León University Hospital building in order to test the proposed methodology. The results show different correlations between environmental variables and building areas and indicate that areas can be grouped depending on their function in the building performance. Furthermore, this approach is able to provide discernible results in the presence of large differences with respect to the consumption ranges of the different areas, unlike conventional approaches where the influence of smaller areas is usually hidden.","2020-06-30","2023-02-15 00:05:02","2023-02-15 00:05:02","2023-02-15 00:05:02","3665","","13","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study constructs a framework suitable for China that has both the ability of quick responses and full-time dynamic decision support, such as an experienced expert, while not being affected by pressure, to be used an emergency response for sudden water pollution accidents. To allow new decisionmakers to integrate into this professional decision-making role more quickly, a brain-inspired system is realized through combining the machine learning algorithm KNN and the idea of iteration and dynamic programming. The feasibility of our framework is further tested through a major water pollution happened recently. The results show that this framework can be well connected with the emergency response technology system that has been completed before, while also supporting the rapid and robust decision making such as the decisionmaker’s second brain, reducing the demand for professional background and experience of emergency decisionmakers, thus effectively shorten the waiting period for response.","2021-11-03","2023-02-15 00:05:00","2023-02-15 00:05:00","2023-02-15 00:04:59","3097","","21","13","","Water","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These optimal control parameters will be very valuable to all the online optimization problems where the convergence time and the failure convergence rate are vital concerns. The newly proposed strategy uses two nested PSO (NESTPSO) searching loops; the inner one contained the original objective function, and the outer one used the inner PSO as a fitness function. The control parameters and the swarm size acted as the optimization variables for the outer loop. These variables were optimized for the lowest premature convergence rate, the lowest number of iterations, and the lowest swarm size. The new proposed strategy can be used for all the swarm optimization techniques as well.

Such approaches normally rely on object and contact models and do not generalize well to novel manipulation tasks. Here, we propose a modular grip stabilization method based on a proposition that explains how humans achieve grasp stability. In this biomimetic approach, independent tactile grip stabilization controllers ensure that slip does not occur locally at the engaged robot fingers. Local slip is predicted from the tactile signals of each fingertip sensor i.e., BioTac and BioTac SP by Syntouch. We show that stable grasps emerge without any form of central communication when such independent controllers are engaged in the control of multi-digit robotic hands. The resulting grasps are resistant to external perturbations while ensuring stable grips on a wide variety of objects.","2020-03-21","2023-02-15 00:04:48","2023-02-15 00:04:48","2023-02-15 00:04:47","1748","","6","20","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, the current study expands the application of sEMG-controlled steering assistance by validating the Myo armband, a mass-produced sEMG-based interface, with respect to the path-following accuracy of a commercially available automobile. It was hypothesized that one-handed remote steering with the Myo armband would be comparable or superior to the conventional operation of the automobile steering wheel. Although results of low-speed field testing indicate that the Myo armband had lower path-following accuracy than the steering wheel during a 90° turn and wide U-turn at twice the minimum turning radius, the Myo armband had superior path-following accuracy for a narrow U-turn at the minimum turning radius and a 45° turn.

Lab on chips foster the integration of actuation and detection systems, and require minute sample and reagent amounts. Typically employed microfluidic structures have similar dimensions as cells, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of individual cells and their local environments. Several strategies for high spatio-temporal control of cells in microfluidics have been reported in recent years, namely methods relying on careful design of the microfluidic structures (                e.g.                pinched flow), by integration of actuators (                e.g.                electrodes or magnets for dielectro-, acousto- and magneto-phoresis), or integrations thereof. This review presents the recent developments of cell experiments in microfluidics divided into two parts: an introduction to spatial control of cells in microchannels followed by special emphasis in the high temporal control of cell-stimulus reaction and quenching. In the end, the present state of the art is discussed in line with future perspectives and challenges for translating these devices into routine applications.","2016","2023-02-15 00:04:09","2023-02-15 00:04:09","2023-02-15 00:04:09","1888-1905","","6","141","","Analyst","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","hybrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple optical flow sensors are mounted on a micro air vehicle (MAV) at different positions with different viewing directions for detecting optical flow around the MAV. A fault-tolerant decentralized extended Kalman filter (EKF) is performed for estimating navigation errors by fusing the inertial and optical flow measurements, which can prevent the estimation divergence caused by the failure of the optical flow sensor. Then, the estimation of navigation error is inputted into the SINS settlement process for correcting the SINS measurements. The results verify that the navigation errors of SINS can be effectively reduced (even more than 9/10). Moreover, although the sensor is in a state of failure for 400 seconds, the fault-tolerant integrated navigation system can still work properly without divergence.","2018-09-20","2023-02-15 00:04:03","2023-02-15 00:04:03","2023-02-15 00:04:02","1-17","","","2018","","Journal of Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous pan-sharpening methods are based on intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform, which may cause evident spectral distortion. To address this problem, an IHS-based pan-sharpening method using ripplet transform and compressed sensing is proposed. Firstly, the IHS transform is applied to the MS image to separate intensity components. Secondly, discrete ripplet transform (DRT) is implemented on the intensity component and the PAN image to obtain multi-scale sub-images. High-frequency sub-images are fused by a local variance algorithm and, for low-frequency sub-images, compressed sensing is introduced for the reconstruction of the intensity component so as to integrate the local information from both the intensity component and the PAN image. The specific fusion rule is defined by local difference. Finally, the inverse ripplet transform and inverse IHS transform are coupled to generate the pan-sharpened image. The proposed method is compared with five state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods and also the Gram-Schmidt (GS) method through visual and quantitative analysis of WorldView-2, Pleiades and Triplesat datasets. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieves relatively higher spatial resolution and more desirable spectral fidelity.","2018-10-25","2023-02-15 00:04:00","2023-02-15 00:04:00","2023-02-15 00:04:00","3624","","11","18","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal is to make the robot able to engage users through natural language for different tasks. Using our software the robot can (i) talk to the user and understand their sentiments through a dedicated Semantic Sentiment Analysis engine; (ii) answer to open-dialog natural language utterances by means of a Generative Conversational Agent; (iii) perform action commands leveraging a defined Robot Action ontology and open-dialog natural language utterances; and (iv) detect which objects the user is handing by using convolutional neural networks trained on a huge collection of annotated objects. Each module can be extended with more data and information and the overall architectural design is general, flexible, and scalable and can be expanded with other components, thus enriching the interaction with the human.

A drawback of these and other small molecule inducers is the difficulty of their removal from cell cultures, limiting their application for dynamic control. Here, we describe a simple method to overcome this limitation, and show that the natural photosensitivity of aTc/Tc can be exploited to turn them into highly predictable optogenetic transcriptional- and growth-regulators. This new optogenetic class uniquely features both dynamic and setpoint control which act via population-memory adjustable through opto-chemical modulation. We demonstrate this method by applying it for dynamic gene expression control and for enhancing the performance of an existing optogenetic system. We then expand the utility of the aTc system by constructing a new chemical bandpass filter that increases its aTc response range. The simplicity of our method enables scientists and biotechnologists to use their existing systems employing aTc/Tc for dynamic optogenetic experiments without genetic modification.","2020-07-31","2023-02-15 00:03:27","2023-02-15 00:03:27","2023-02-15 00:03:27","3834","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physiological regulation can be achieved in these nanomaterials through external light. The combination of nanomaterials with infrared optics can be termed optogenetics. The low autofluorescence of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) has several applications in the biological field. For optogenetics applications, UCNPs with high fluorescence performance and photostability can solve the penetration depth problem. NaYF                4                :Yb,Tm nanocrystals with controllable sizes, shapes, and compositions were synthesized using a rapid coprecipitation method in organic solvent. UCNPs using single crystal nanoparticles provide higher chemical stability than those using amorphous phase. However, because UCNPs are usually capped with hydrophobic ligands, it is particularly important to prepare biocompatible UCNPs with specific molecular recognition capabilities. Surface modification and subsequent functionalization are essential for the application of inorganic nanomaterials in the biological environment and are arousing increasing research interest. Due to the high biocompatibility and high loading of materials, mesoporous silica and amine groups were selected as the best candidates. Expression of plasmid DNA                in vivo                and transfection efficiency were determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The MTT assay was used to evaluate the particle biocompatibility; the results showed that UCNP@mSiO                2                has great biocompatibility. Additionally, at neutral pH, the cell surface is negatively charged. Therefore, the surface is functionalized with amino groups and can be electrostatically bound to DNA. Finally, UCNP@mSiO                2                -NH                2                as a vector was applied in live cells by loading DNA; according to the results, DNA-UCNPs were successfully transfected in the primary cells, and NaYF                4                :Yb,Tm@mSiO                2                -NH                2                -DNA were observed to have good transfection efficiency by flow cytometry. It is expected that this work will provide a different method from the traditional adenovirus method and improve the immune response and side effects caused by adenovirus.","2020","2023-02-15 00:03:19","2023-02-15 00:03:19","2023-02-15 00:03:18","41013-41021","","67","10","","RSC Adv.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-fidelity haptic feedback is critical to the safety and success of any interaction with human beings. Such interactions can be seen in haptic systems utilized in medical fields, such as for surgical training, robotic tele-surgery, and tele-rehabilitation, which require appropriate haptic interface design and control. In order to recreate high-fidelity soft and stiff contact experiences for the user in the intended application, different designs strike different trade-offs between the desirable characteristics of an interface, such as back-drivability, low apparent inertia and low friction for the best perception of small reflected forces, large intrinsic stiffness and force feedback capability for the best perception of large reflected forces, a large-enough workspace for exploring the remote or virtual environment, and the uniformity of haptic feedback and its adequate sensitivity over the workspace. Meeting all of the requirements simultaneously is impossible, and different application-driven compromises need to be made. This paper reviews how various kinematic designs have helped address these trade-offs in desired specifications. First, we investigate the required characteristics of linkage-based haptic interfaces and inevitable trade-offs between them. Then, we study the state of the art in the kinematic design of haptic interfaces and their advantages and limitations. In all sections, we consider the applications of the intended haptic interfaces in medical scenarios. Non-linkage-based haptic interfaces are also shortly discussed to show the broad range of haptic technologies in the area. The potentials of kinematic redundancy to address the design trade-offs are introduced. Current challenges and future directions of haptic interface designs for medical applications are shortly discussed, which is finally followed by the conclusion.","2021-04-01","2023-02-15 00:03:13","2023-02-15 00:03:13","2023-02-15 00:03:13","022005","","2","3","","Prog.

Observations made in past field studies suggest that ET and its impact on soil hydrology can also lead to increases in soil pollutant concentrations near shrubs. To investigate this, sections of a mature willow plantation (seven years old) were cut to eliminate transpiration (Cut treatment). Soil concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), aliphatic compounds C10–C50, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and five trace elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn) were compared between the Cut and the uncut plots (Salix miyabeana ‘SX61’). Over 24 months, the results clearly show that removal of the willow shrubs limited the contaminants’ increase in the soil surface, as observed for C10–C50 and of 10 PAHs under the Salix treatment. This finding strongly reinforces a hypothesis that SRIC of willows may facilitate the migration of contaminants towards their roots, thus increasing their concentration in the surrounding soil. Such a “pumping effect” in a high-density willow crop is a prominent characteristic specific to field studies that can lead to counterintuitive results. Although apparent increases of contaminant concentrations contradict the purification benefits usually pursued in phytoremediation, the possibility of active phytoextraction and rhizodegradation is not excluded. Moreover, increases of pollutant concentrations under shrubs following migration suggest that decreases would consequently occur at the source points. Some reflections on interpreting field work results are provided.","2021-03-26","2023-02-15 00:03:10","2023-02-15 00:03:10","2023-02-15 00:03:10","2979","","7","11","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a simple, fast, and cost-effective curved-crease origami technique for transforming flat sheets of flexible plastic material into face shields for infection control.

The latter can be achieved by regulating to zero the power exchanged with the main grid. The second feature allows to limit voltage increases due to active power injection by distributed energy resources and, thus, to limit stresses on the electrical infrastructure and the served loads, which is a concrete issue as renewables become widely deployed in the low-voltage scenario.

In this research, eye movement dynamics were studied in terms of chaotic behavior and self-similarity assessment to provide a description of young, healthy, oculomotor system characteristics. The first of the investigated features is present and advantageous for many biological objects or physiological phenomena, and its vanishing or diminishment may indicate a system pathology. Similarly, exposed self-similarity may prove useful for indicating a young and healthy system characterized by adaptability. For this research, 24 young people with normal vision were involved. Their eye movements were registered with the usage of a head-mounted eye tracker, using infrared oculography, embedded in the sensor, measuring the rotations of the left and the right eye. The influence of the preprocessing step in the form of the application of various filtering methods on the assessment of the final dynamics was also explored. The obtained results confirmed the existence of chaotic behavior in some parts of eye movement signal; however, its strength turned out to be dependent on the filter used.

The standardized testing of soft tissues requires different experimental protocols and fixtures compared to hard tissues or non-biological materials due to their characteristics. Some of the most commonly-used clamping methods for soft tissue testing affect the tissues’ mechanical properties as chemicals are involved to decelerate degradation and autolysis. Moreover, they are unsuitable for standardized and high-throughput testing. Material slippage is also a recurrent unwanted influence on the testing routine with impact on measurement validity. Addressing these issues, this protocol presents a clamping system for simplified testing of biological soft tissues with all necessary components manufactured utilizing 3D printing technology. Templates allow trimming the samples into standardized shapes and sizes while preparation tables facilitate clamping in a fixed distance. The key parts of the system are clamps with a pyramid design, which allow the mounting of biological soft tissues before transferring it into the testing device and minimize material slippage during tensile testing. Flexible holder arms are used to transfer samples from preparation tables into the testing device and simplify positioning. Mechanical testing itself is performed with digital image correlation for precise strain measurements.","2020-10-01","2023-05-12 21:51:52","2023-05-12 21:51:52","2023-05-12 21:51:31","e00159","","","8","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\Y2W25U3U\Scholze et al. - 2020 - Standardized tensile testing of soft tissue using .pdf","","","3D printing; Biomechanical testing; Clamps; Soft tissues; Tensile testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drying is highly dependent on the condition of the drying air in terms of temperature, relative humidity and velocity and on the thickness of the product layer. The influence of these drying parameters on the drying behavior and quality is product-specific and has to be investigated in laboratory experiments due to the high costs for full-scale evaluation. For this purpose, a high precision laboratory dryer was developed in order to achieve controlled and stable climate conditions during the drying of light bulk material. To avoid temperature drift of the load cell during drying, a temperature-controlled sensor housing was applied. To further stabilize the signal, it was corrected with the instantaneous temperature. The high precision laboratory dryer HPD TF1 could be potentially useful to establish drying curves for defined temperature, relative humidity and velocity of the drying air.

As a case study, open source face masks were 3-D printed in PEKK and shown not to warp upon widely home-accessible oven-based sterilization.","2020-10-01","2023-05-12 21:51:25","2023-05-12 21:51:25","2023-05-12 21:50:59","e00130","","","8","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\4Y4XI9AT\Skrzypczak et al. - 2020 - Open source high-temperature RepRap for 3-D printi.pdf","","","Open source; RepRap; Open hardware; 3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; COVID-19; High temperature 3-D printing; Medical hardware; Open source medical hardware; Polycarbonate; ULTEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world.

The swab was designed using parametric OpenSCAD in two components (a head with engineered break point and various handles), which has several advantages: i) minimizing print time on relatively slow SLA printers, ii) enabling the use of smaller print volume open source SLA printers, iii) reducing the amount of relatively expensive UV resin, and iv) enabling production of handle on more accessible material extrusion 3-D printers. A modular open source UV LED box was designed, fabricated for $45 and tested for batch curing. Swabs can be fabricated for $0.06-$0.12/swab.

Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O.

The comparatively low cost and no-fluid-contact design of peristaltic pumps make them the go-to systems for such ventures, but using commercially available pumping systems this still becomes a costly endeavor at typically $250-$1000 per pump line. Here we have developed an alternative, a peristaltic pump that can be fabricated in most research laboratories using 3D-printing and readily available off-the-shelf parts. The pump features 8 parallel channels with linear ranges spanning from 0.7 µL/min to 6 mL/min. The pump can be fabricated and assembled by anyone with access to a 3D-printer at a cost of less than $45 per channel and is driven by a stepper motor that connects directly to any computer. This device has the potential to be disruptive in areas such as drug screening and assay development, as well as lab-on-a-chip applications and cell cultivation, where it significantly reduces hardware expenses and allows for construction of more comprehensive fluidic systems at a fraction of current costs.","2020-10-01","2023-05-12 21:50:06","2023-05-12 21:50:06","2023-05-12 21:49:55","e00115","","","8","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\LHF77IGC\Jönsson et al. - 2020 - The FAST Pump, a low-cost, easy to fabricate, SLA-.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\9SIFBQ8C\S2468067220300249.html","","","Open source hardware; Open hardware; DIY; 3D-printing; SLA; DLP; Ease-of-use; Off the shelf; Stereolithography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead, we propose an easy-to-adopt, cost effective, open source hydrogel bead generator. This generator consists of two modules. The first module rotates two immiscible liquids in rigid body motion: mineral oil as the continuous phase (CP) liquid on top, and a hydrogel cross-linking (CL) liquid at bottom. The second module injects a hydrogel pre-polymer solution as the dispersed phase (DP) liquid into the rotating CP liquid. As the DP liquid flows out of a syringe needle, its drops are pinched off by the shear force from the CP liquid, and move with the CP liquid while settling down. When the drops enter the CL liquid, they become hydrogel beads. Experiments using water and mineral oil showed that the size of produced drops could be controlled by adjusting the flow speed of the CP and DP liquids. A demonstration using alginate showed that the proposed generator could successfully create alginate gel beads of uniform size and shape.","2020-10-01","2023-05-12 21:50:00","2023-05-12 21:50:00","2023-05-12 21:49:58","e00121","","","8","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\NER85VK7\Zhang and Ryu - 2020 - Rotating-liquid-based hydrogel bead generator.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\Z7F759JS\S2468067220300304.html","","","Alginate; Continuous phase; Cross flow; Dispersed phase; Dripping mode; Drop generation; Jetting mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce the labor entailed in moon watching, we designed a low-cost system called LunAero that can track and record video of the moon at night. Here we present a proof-of-concept prototype that can serve as a platform for citizen scientists interested in observing nocturnal bird migration. We tested the video recording on clear nights from February 2018 to May 2019 when the moon was full or nearly full. Manual analysis of a 1.5 h sample of video revealed a total of 450 birds, which is a much higher detection rate than previous moon watching efforts have yielded. The hardware described here is part of a larger effort involving software development (currently underway) to automate recorded video analysis.

The primary design goal was to minimize the vehicle’s size and cost while providing a stable and maneuverable platform with onboard autonomy. To that end the vehicle is built using 3D printed and off-the-shelf hobbyist electronic components and uses an overhead camera system to simulate sensor data to minimize the number of onboard sensors required. This article describes the context, design, and assembly procedures for a microUSV and demonstrates the platform’s base-level functionality in the form of a waypoint following controller implementation for both single and multi-robot configurations.","2020-04-01","2023-05-12 21:42:58","2023-05-12 21:42:58","2023-05-12 21:42:54","e00105","","","7","","HardwareX","microUSV","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\QY8GLX39\Gregory and Vardy - 2020 - microUSV A low-cost platform for indoor marine sw.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\G48HC7TH\S2468067220300134.html","","","Autonomous surface vehicle; Boat; Multi-robot system; Swarm; Unmanned surface vehicle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed a microinjection system that can support and semiautomate the injections of small animals.

Due to the presence of electrical wires and sensors, heating MET using water jacket recirculation can raise safety issues, whereas heating coils may affect the results of electrochemical analyses. The proposed open-source temperature-control chamber (OpenTCC) aims to provide a low-cost solution for controlling temperature (in the range 20–55 °C) while simultaneously reducing the electromagnetic interferences caused by switching mode power supplies. OpenTCC consists of a light and cheap structure, incorporating eight heating pads and two Peltier-cooling modules powered by open-source electronic circuits. Its hardware is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller and a Python interface which provides data-logging and serve as a basis for programable temperature cycles. The system has a modular design to allow stacking several independent modules. OpenTCC provides a reliable and tunable temperature control at lower costs than currently available commercial temperature controllers and provides a platform for field-specific upgrades. Though optimized for MET, Open-TCC can be adapted to other laboratory applications due to its flexible design.","2020-04-01","2023-05-12 21:42:55","2023-05-12 21:42:55","2023-05-12 21:42:54","e00099","","","7","","HardwareX","OpenTCC","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\9LYY5TJT\Sánchez et al. - 2020 - OpenTCC An open source low-cost temperature-contr.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\5NJKTJTI\S2468067220300080.html","","","Bioelectrochemistry; Electrical noise; Faraday cage; Incubator; Peltier element","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this platform, a series of experiments was carried out to observe the effect of in vivo axial stretch on axonal lengthening.

In both marine and terrestrial systems, observing the ecology of remote locations at fine temporal scales is made difficult by the high cost or complexity of resurveying the same location at high frequency.

Thus, we designed LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home cage Device) with the goal of using capacitive sensors to increase accuracy and analyze lick microstructure, building a device compatible with ventilated home cages, increasing scale with prolonged undisturbed recordings, and creating a design that is easy to build and use with an intuitive touchscreen graphical user interface. The system tracks two-bottle choice licking behavior in up to 18 rodent cages, or 36 single bottles, on a minute-to-minute timescale controlled by a single Arduino microcontroller. The data are logged to a single SD card, allowing for efficient downstream analysis. LIQ HD accuracy was validated with sucrose, quinine, and ethanol two-bottle choice tasks. The system measures preference over time and changes in bout microstructure, with undisturbed recordings tested up to 7 d. All designs and software are open-source to allow other researchers to build on the system and adapt LIQ HD to their animal home cages.","2023-04-01","2023-05-12 21:39:26","2023-05-12 21:39:26","2023-05-12 21:39:26","","","4","10","","eNeuro","LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home Cage Device)","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2023 Petersen et al..

In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs.

Developed primarily for dielectric elastomer actuators, it offers a low-cost solution to generate user controllable voltages up to 5 kV, either continuous, or as square waves with a frequency range between 1 mHz and 1 kHz. The high voltage power supply was developed as an answer to the lack of commercial devices that combine a low cost (<450 USD), portability, and the ability to generate square signals with a high slew rate (>15 V/µs for a 1 pF load). The PCB is designed to be easy to assemble, with a minimum of panel-mounted elements: the unit is controlled from a computer with a user-friendly interface. A Python library of functions is provided, which enables seamless integration of the power supply with other instruments.

Many available designs, however, may be too complex to fabricate in teaching environments. Presented here is OMIS, the Open Millifluidic Inquiry System, which is a platform for performing small-scale chemical synthesis and analysis. OMIS consists of a 3D printed syringe pump, control hardware based upon the Arduino microcontroller and 3D printed reaction vessels. The OMIS syringe pump utilizes a low-power stepper motor which simplifies the instrument construction and allows for power to be supplied from batteries or the USB port of a computer. The simple design of OMIS allows for the instrument to be fabricated in one day, including the time to 3D print components. The OMIS syringe pump is able to deliver fluids at rates between 60 and 300 μL/min, depending on syringe size, with a reproducibility of 3%. Several applications of OMIS are presented, including a demonstration of laminar flow in a 3D printed millifluidic chip, implementation of a low-volume flow-cell cuvette insert and the synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles.","2018-10-01","2023-05-12 21:33:01","2023-05-12 21:33:01","2023-05-12 21:33:00","e00038","","","4","","HardwareX","OMIS","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\JM5VFGSU\LeSuer et al. - 2018 - OMIS The Open Millifluidic Inquiry System for sma.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\ARW4LFRK\S246806721830052X.html","","","3D printed syringe pump; Arduino microcontroller; Lab on a chip","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, the conventional system needs some modification to ensure there is minimal wastage and food grains reach the right people. The major contribution of the hardware lies in acquiring records from the warehouses located in far off places to a centralized server managed by the administrator. This system also solves the problem of black marketing with the use of Aadhar cards and biometric scanning which are used for the verification of the consumer at the time of purchase.

The broad design requirements included (i) fuselage capable of accommodating an imaging package or other instrumentation, (ii) suitability for over-lake BVLOS authorization in Switzerland, (iii) capability of land or water take-offs/landing, (iv) at least 90-min flight autonomy, (v) modularity of the imaging package and (vi) real-time IR/RGB imagery. Requirement (i) was to ensure an aircraft amenable to future developments. Requirements (ii)–(iv) were driven by the goal of improving estimates of lake surface energy fluxes, since such fluxes have a major impact on long-term lake temperatures and hence ecological status. Requirement (v), in conjunction with (i), allows the UAV to be adapted to other imaging applications. The real-time imagery requirement (vi) permits modifications of on-going missions to map areas of specific interest as they are detected. The prototype UAV produced to satisfy these characteristics was built on the twin-motor My Twin Dream (MTD) aircraft, which has a 1.8-m wing span airframe and a spacious fuselage. The legal authorization necessitated, where feasible, hardware redundancy as well as installation of a parachute system. Continuous communication between the ground station and UAV is provided by the LTE cellular telephone network. The UAV communication is handled by an on-board Linux computer, which is also responsible for control of the imagery package. The avionics involved modifications of the open-source APM autopilot software and the associated ground control station. A key modification was to support a custom-built emergency recovery system, which is triggered by loss of a heart-beat signal from the autopilot. The MTD airframe was modified to accommodate the system electronics and imaging hardware.

SCA is responsible for over 300,000 deaths per year both in Europe and in USA, and immediate clinical assistance through defibrillation is fundamental for recovery. In this context, an open-source approach can easily lead in improvements to the distribution and efficiency of AEDs. The proposed Open-Source AED (OAED) is composed of two separate electric boards: a high voltage board (HV-B), which contains the circuitry required to perform defibrillation and a control board (C-B), which detects SCA in the patient and controls the HV-B. Computer simulations and preliminary tests show that the OAED can release a 200J biphasic defibrillation in about 12s and detects SCA with sensitivity higher than 90% and specificity of about 99%.

The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17°C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light.","2017-10-01","2023-05-12 21:20:40","2023-05-12 21:20:40","2023-05-12 21:20:40","13-33","","","2","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\YTJNGB5D\Chen et al. - 2017 - A programmable optical stimulator for the Drosophi.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\RSTRGBUT\S246806721730024X.html","","","Drosophila; Embedded computers; Light-emitting diodes; Open hardware; Optical stimulation; Rhodopsin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, the educational buildings sector presents a very interesting and important case for the monitoring and management of buildings, since it addresses both energy and educational issues. In this work, we present and discuss the hardware IoT infrastructure substrate that provides real-time monitoring in multiple school buildings. We believe that such a system needs to follow an open design approach: rely on hardware-agnostic components that communicate over well-defined open interfaces. We present in detail the design of our hardware components, while also providing insights to the overall system design and a first set of results on their operation. The presented hardware components are utilized as the core hardware devices for GAIA, an EU research project aimed at the educational community. As our system has been deployed and tested in several public school buildings in Greece, we also report on its validation.","2017-04-01","2023-05-12 21:18:58","2023-05-12 21:18:58","2023-05-12 21:18:58","54-67","","","1","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\T5QLR5Z6\Pocero et al. - 2017 - Open source IoT meter devices for smart and energy.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\SXPXKVPD\S2468067216300293.html","","","Environmental monitoring; Open source hardware and software; Energy efficiency; IoT deployment; Smart school building; Validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed design is intrinsically unbalanced and features a very good match to a 50Ω line at resonance, which makes our device essentially plug’n’play for a coaxial cable feed. Another interesting property of the proposed antenna is its simplicity of construction. The antenna has been modelled using the moment method. A prototype resonant at 2.4GHz has been built and we have measured its impedance in this spectral region. The radiation pattern and the gain at resonance have also been characterized and the device has been shown to provide 6.31 dBi gain. The overall properties of the device make it an excellent option to provide WiFi connectivity when required in open hardware implementations.","2017-04-01","2023-05-12 21:18:53","2023-05-12 21:18:53","2023-05-12 21:18:52","46-53","","","1","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\YEJMFLK9\Chamorro-Posada et al. - 2017 - A plug’n’play WiFi surface-mount dual-loop antenna.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\H4KHY2MC\S2468067216300104.html","","","Loop antenna; Surface mount; WiFi connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These patterns of activity often limit the extent of animal co-occurrence in space and time. Quantifying when particular species are active and how activity varies with environmental conditions is difficult without the use of automated devices due to the need for continuous monitoring. Time-sorting pitfall traps passively collect active arthropods into containers with known beginning and end sample times. The trap described here, similar to previous designs, sorts arthropods by the time they fall into the trap using a rotating circular rack of vials. This trap represents a reduction in size, cost, and time of construction, while increasing the number of time windows sampled. The addition of temperature data collection extends functionality, while the use of store-bought components and inclusion of customizable software make the trap easy to reproduce and use.","2017-04-01","2023-05-12 21:18:50","2023-05-12 21:18:50","2023-05-12 21:18:50","38-45","","","1","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\7MFAHW57\McMunn - 2017 - A time-sorting pitfall trap and temperature datalo.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\G3Q3HK6X\S2468067216300220.html","","","Activity times; Arthropod collection; Circadian rhythms; Datalogger; Entomology; Time-sorting pitfall trap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It can be interfaced with fixed traffic sensors, or receive data from vehicle transponders. This platform is specifically designed for solar-powered, low bandwidth, high computational performance wireless sensor network applications. A self-recovering unit is designed to increase reliability and allow periodic hard resets, an essential requirement for sensor networks. A radio monitoring circuitry is proposed to monitor incoming and outgoing transmissions, simplifying software debugging. We illustrate the performance of this wireless sensor platform on complex problems arising in smart cities, such as traffic flow monitoring, machine-learning-based flash flood monitoring or Kalman-filter based vehicle trajectory estimation.

Several commercial automatic feeders for animal experiments are available which are specific to certain species and food types. However, it would be beneficial for researchers if they could easily build their own experimental feeders customized for their study species, food types, and other experimental considerations. In this paper, we describe an open source experimental feeder using an Arduino microcontroller. The design of the feeder is focused on simplicity to provide a straight-forward building process and allow custom modifications for various requirements. The cost for building this feeder is less than €200 and we have successfully tested our design with three different food types for pigeons, cats, and marmoset monkeys.","2017-04-01","2023-05-12 21:18:42","2023-05-12 21:18:42","2023-05-12 21:18:42","13-21","","","1","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\KC4PM8JK\Oh et al. - 2017 - An open source automatic feeder for animal experim.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\N8Q3GQT8\S2468067216300050.html","","","Operant conditioning; Open source hardware; Animal experiments; Automatic feeder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs.","2017-04-01","2023-05-12 21:18:20","2023-05-12 21:18:37","2023-05-12 21:18:20","1-12","","","1","","HardwareX","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\NATRK6F3\Dhankani and Pearce - 2017 - Open source laboratory sample rotator mixer and sh.pdf; C:\Users\Andre Maia Chagas\Zotero\storage\N8N8AWQY\S2468067216300049.html","","","Open source hardware; Open hardware; Lab mixer; Mixer; Rotator mixer; Shaker","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
