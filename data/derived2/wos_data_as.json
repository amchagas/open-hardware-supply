Typically, management includes removal of the hardware, debridement of necrotic tissue, and eventual placement of an alternative method of stabilization, usually, an external fixator or cast. However, problems arise when the fracture cannot be managed adequately with an external method. Such is the case with supination external rotation (SER) fractures, yet maintaining the hardware in the setting of infection typically is not considered an option.", "METHODS: Case report and review of pertinent English-language literature.", "RESULTS: The patient was a 47-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who sustained a type IV SER fracture that was treated with plate and screw fixation.

This was treated with debridement of the wound and dressing changes while leaving the hardware in place. It was decided to use a free muscle flap in an effort to preserve the ankle for a functional outcome versus the alternative of a below-knee amputation. With a free rectus abdominis flap, the lower extremity was preserved, and after four months, the patient was able to walk. One year postoperatively, the patient was ambulating without difficulty, and the hardware was still in place.", "CONCLUSIONS: This report examines the dilemma of SER ankle fractures and how management strategies must be tailored to the individual situation.

Dysphagia is a well-documented complication associated with ACDF. It may result postoperatively from a variety of etiologies, including hardware displacement, pharyngeal edema, or vocal fold paresis. One rare cause of persistent dysphagia is the formation of a hypopharyngeal diverticulum, reported in the literature in 9 previous cases. Such diverticula after ACDF surgery may have pathogenesis that is distinct from that of typical Zenker diverticula. We report 3 new cases of hypopharyngeal diverticula in patients who underwent revision ACDFs. Variables assessed included age, sex, level of fusion, ACDF-related complications, and diverticulum management. Two patients underwent successful open surgical diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeal myotomy. In the third case, the patient had a small diverticulum close to the surgical hardware and minimal symptoms and was managed conservatively. Our cases, combined with the 9 previous cases, demonstrate commonalities, particularly with regard to the risk of revision spinal surgery and infection and subsequent hypopharyngeal diverticula development.

As the demand varies between the different behaviors swarm and organism behavior the behavior of the simulator needs to vary as well, e.g. for a swarm, a dynamic simulation is not necessary, whereas for an organism, a fast dynamic simulation is obligatory. We are therefore developing the Symbricator3D simulation environment, that will fulfill all the described requirements.", "Smartphone is becoming more and more popular in, mobile market but applications running on smartphone are much fewer than on existing mobile phones. In order to overcome the shortage of smartphone applications, we have developed the sharable mobile platform that can be used on both smartphones and legacy mobile phones.

However, communication node mobility in such systems can lead to rapid channel variation which limits the quality of attainable channel state information (CSI).

Results based on experimentally obtained MIMO channels in outdoor environments are presented.", "Software routers based on personal computer (PC) architectures are becoming an important alternative to proprietary and expensive network devices. However, software routers suffer from many limitations Of the PC architecture, including, among others, limited bus and central processing unit (CPU) bandwidth high memory access latency, limited scalability in terms of number of network interface cards, and lack of resilience mechanisms. Multistage PC-based architectures can be an interesting alternative since they permit us to i) increase the performance of singlesoftware routers, ii) scale router size, iii) distribute packet-manipulation and control functionality, iv) recover from single-component failures, and v) incrementally upgrade router performance. We propose a specific multistage architecture, exploiting PC-based routers as switching elements, to build a high-speed, largesize, scalable, and reliable software router. A small-scale prototype of the multistage router is currently up and running in our labs, and performance evaluation is un er way.", "This paper presents an on-going research project on development of a wireless sensor node equipped a MEMS accelerometer, which is aiming to design a wireless sensor node to meet specific requirements of the drive-by bridge monitoring for short span bridges.

The goal of SHM techniques is to identify, quantify and locate damage in structures. In light of the aging infrastructure and recent failures of important bridges, long-term monitoring techniques are being increasing investigated and adopted. In addition to SHM, structural control (SC) is increasingly adopted in modern structures around the world. In the past two decades a number of SC techniques, including, passive, semi-active, and active control methods have been developed and adopted in civil engineering-particularly, in infrastructure such as important tall buildings, critical facilities, and long span bridges. Both SHM and SC technology face significant challenges due to the size and scale of civil engineering structures.

As such, AMRDEC has developed Continuum, a new software architecture foundation to allow for the integration of these codes into a HWIL lab facility while enhancing existing AMRDEC HWIL scene generation codes such as the Joint Signature Image Generator (JSIG). This new real-time framework is a minimalistic modular approach based on the National Institute of Standards (NIST) Neutral Messaging Language (NML) that provides the basis for common HWIL scene generation. High speed interconnects and protocols were examined to support distributed scene generation whereby the scene graph, associated phenomenology, and resulting scene can be designed around the data rather than a framework, and the scene elements can be dynamically distributed across multiple high performance computing assets. Because of this open architecture approach, the framework facilitates scaling from a single GPU \"traditional\" PC scene generation system to a multi-node distributed system requiring load distribution and scene compositing across multiple high performance computing platforms. This takes advantage of the latest advancements in GPU hardware, such as NVIDIA's Tesla and Fermi architectures, providing an increased benefit in both fidelity and performance of the associated scene's phenomenology. Other features of the Continuum easily extend the use of this framework to include visualization, diagnostic, analysis, configuration, and other HWIL and all digital simulation tools.", "In this paper, we describe an embed iris recognition system for the personal identification.

First, this paper identifies the main items possessing the large portion of SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system by the experiment on the target platform which is similar to a commercial mobile handheld system. Both the world interoperabillity for microwave access (WiMAX) and high speed downlink packet access (HS-DPA) waveform software packages are used as an SCA waveform application. This paper also presents the results of the relative binary size distribution of SCA software resources for looking for the major elements making an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system heavier. As a result, when focusing on the relative weight portion of SCA core framework (CF), the SCA CF takes 16% up and others have 84% out of the whole binary size distribution of SCA software resources. The results of the experiment give us notice that the weight portion of SCA CF is minor and compatible with the overall software binary size needs of an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system, on the other hand, the practical problem on the lightweight is in a common object request broker architecture (CORBA) and extensible markup language (XML) parser resources. Second, this paper describes an important feature for implementing a high speed broadband radio to an SCA waveform and presents the performance evaluation results of the SCA port communication on both power PC (PPC) 405 and x86 processor platforms. The PPC 405 platform, which is similar to a commercial mobile handset, takes the value of average round trip time (RTT) with a maximum of thirty six millisecond. The x86 platform, however, which is analogous to a server platform, maintains stable micro-second resolution. From our experiments, we observe that rapid SCA port communication, sufficiently less than the frame length of high-speed broadband radios, should be provided for serving those radio services in a commercial handheld system based on the SCA.", "Software/open routers, PCs (personal computers) running open-source OSs (operating systems) and equipped with Ethernet network interface cards (NICs), are receiving increasing attention in the research community, because they can offer multi-gigabit-per-second packet forwarding speed, performance comparable to those of low-to-medium end commercial routers. However, commercially available NICs lack programmability. Furthermore, the use of standard NICs implies that each packet crosses the bus twice, and is processed and routed in software by the OS, thus reducing forwarding performance. In this paper, we discuss the design and the implementation of an FPGA-based NIC that permits overcoming the performance bottleneck and the lack of flexibility of commercial NICs. Performance and limitations of the proposed approach are thoroughly discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This new technology has transformed the cytogenetics laboratory by adapting techniques that have heretofore been the province of molecular geneticists. Intimate knowledge and comfortable familiarity with these techniques are now a must for the modern cytogeneticist, rather than a stimulating but discretionary intellectual exercise or an elective luxury. The cytogenetic laboratory of the future will likely have more scanners than microscopes, more software packages than darkrooms, and more technologists, supervisors, and directors with molecular training than ever before. This technical convergence between molecular diagnostics and clinical cytogenetics is exciting and has already resulted in many stimulating discoveries. However, the traditional skills of the cytogeneticist are needed now more than ever before. As our ability to inspect the genome increases, so does the variety of abnormalities that we uncover. Understanding the mechanisms of these aberrations to guide additional testing of the parents and genetic counseling of the patients and their families requires the expertise of individuals who are well-versed in meiotic mechanisms and chromosomal structures that may lead to these abnormalities. Cytogeneticists are uniquely positioned to understand these mechanisms and assist genetic counselors and clinicians in their daily interactions with patients and families.", "This paper presents that software radio technique is applied to laser target detection system with the pseudo-random code modulation.

Although virtualization is widely used to make systems reconfigurable, it fails to provide a totally integrated management framework in which the allocation of required services to adequate physical resources takes into account the presence of shared risk groups. We present a basic system architecture and a highly scalable hardware platform, as well as a reliability management framework that provides both a service availability management interface and automated risk assessment. Our evaluation of a prototype system shows that, with the proposed framework, complete service breakdown will occur only in the case of multiple-point failure. While this corresponds to the same level of reliability as ordinary manual risk management, resource utilization efficiency is twice as high.", "In this paper, the implementation in the e-puck robot of an algorithm to keep going in a trajectory while evading fixed obstacles is presented. A review of some existing algorithms for trajectory tracking with obstacles avoidance is done. Also the basic characteristics of the mobile robot e-puck and the programming environment used to implement the control algorithm and prove the performance of the robot are summarized. By modeling the kinematics of the robot and simulating the implementation of the algorithm, the good performance of the control in both the simulated environment and the real robot in different surroundings are shown. The effects of different environmental factors in the performance of the robot are analyzed. This leads to suggest some algorithm improvements as a matter of future works.", "The video capture, processing, and communication in wireless video sensor networks critically depend on the resources of the nodes forming the sensor networks. We provide a survey of wireless video sensor node platforms (WVSNPs). From a comprehensive literature review, we first select the node architectures that meet basic requirements for a WVSNP. We then introduce a classification of WVSNPs into general purpose architectures, heavily coupled architectures, and externally dependent architectures. We thoroughly survey and contrast the existing WVSNPs within this classification framework. Based on the insights from our survey we develop a novel Flexi-WVSNP design. The Flexi-WVSNP design includes dual-radio communication, a middleware for sensor operation and communication control, as well as a cohesive hardware and software design.", ["Exploration of remote environments, once the domain of intrepid adventurers, can now be conducted in relative safety using unmanned vehicles.

Well over 100 search programs have been conducted since that time, primarily at radio and optical wavelengths, (see www.seti.org/searcharchives) without any successful signal detection. Some have suggested that this means humans are alone in the cosmos. But that is far too strong a conclusion to draw from far too small an observational sampling. Instead of concluding that intelligent life on Earth is unique, it is more appropriate to note that in 50 years our ability to search for electromagnetic signals has improved by at least 14 orders of magnitude and that these improvements are still occurring at an exponential rate. At the SETI Institute we are in the process of re-inventing the way we search in order to fully utilize these technological enhancements. We are now building the setiQuest community and we intend to get the world involved in making our searches better. We need to find ways to harness the intelligence of all Earthlings in order to better seek out extraterrestrial intelligence. If we do it right, we just might succeed, and we might also change how we see ourselves, and make our own world a better place.", "We describe herein the features of a novel cultivation system, combining electrical stimulation with medium perfusion for producing thick, functional cardiac patches. A custom-made electrical stimulator was integrated via inserting two carbon rod electrodes into a perfusion bioreactor, housing multiple neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac cell constructs between two 96% open-pore-area fixing nets. The stimulator produced adjustable stimulation waveform (i.e., duty cycle, number of stimulating channels, maximum stimulation amplitude, etc.), specially designed for cardiac cell stimulation. The cell constructs were subjected to a homogenous fluid flow regime and electrical stimulation under conditions optimal for cell excitation. The stimulation threshold in the bioreactor was set by first determining its value in a Petri dish under a microscope, and then matching the current density in the two cultivation systems by constructing electric field models. The models were built by Comsol Multiphysics software using the exact three-dimensional geometry of the two cultivation systems. These models illustrate, for the first time, the local electric conditions required for cardiomyocyte field excitation and they confirmed the uniformity of the electrical field around the cell constructs. Bioreactor cultivation for only 4 days under perfusion and continuous electrical stimulus (74.4 mA/cm(2), 2 ms, bipolar, 1 Hz) promoted cell elongation and striation in the cell constructs and enhanced the expression level of Connexin-43, the gap junction protein responsible for cell-cell coupling. These results thus confirm the validity of the electrical field model in predicting the optimal electrical stimulation in a rather complex cultivation system, a perfusion bioreactor.", "This paper presents the experimental activities on a precommercial hydrogen generator unit HYGen II, for Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) in residential applications. The unit is able to convert light hydrocarbons (methane, propane, LPG, butane) with a nominal hydrogen production of 5 Nm(3)h(-1) and a maximum hydrogen production of 8.5 Nm(3)h(-1). Stability tests with a proprietary Pt/CeO(2) catalyst for the C(3)H(8) autothermal reforming (ATR) step, coupled with commercial catalyst for intermediate water gas shift (ITWS) and preferential oxidation (PROX), have been carried out. Propane conversion of 99.8% associated with total oxygen conversion, in absence of byproducts has been evidenced. A CO concentration below to 10 ppm was observed in the first 140 h of operation. Subsequently, a performance decrease in the ITWS step determined a rapid increase in the CO concentration.", "This paper presents an I advanced control system for the humanoid robot.

This makes its use and integration within safety or security-critical systems, a risk. And, simultaneously an opportunity and a challenge for rigourous, mathematically based, methods which aim at pushing software analysis and development to the level of a mature engineering discipline.", "This paper discusses such a challenge and proposes a number of ways in which open source development may benefit from the whole patrimony of formal methods."], "Human walking is theoretically explained by two prevailing, but contradictory theories. The first theory called \"The Six Determinants of Gait\" (SDG) aims to minimize the energetic cost of locomotion by reducing the vertical displacement of the body center of mass (COM). The second theory called \"The Inverted Pendulum Analogy\" (IPA) suggests that walking is a movement combination of two pendulums: the inverted pendulum for the stance leg and a direct pendulum for the swing leg. Therefore, results that COM describes a quasi-sinusoid curve. The main evidence against SDG theory is that a flattened COM trajectory increases muscle work and force requirements. The IPA theory analysis shows that it predicts no work or force requirements. These shortcomings may be resolved through a new theory: \"The Dynamic Walking Theory\" DWT. These theories describe more or less appropriate walking of healthy persons. The paper presents some theoretical aspects to he considered at the design of a mechatronic system for the locomotory disabled persons.", "It is vital that space colonies and settlements be able to maximize any possible advantages to improve survival of both man and machines. An array of human and machine solutions and operations can be utilized to not only enhance safety, but to also increase productivity. For many years robots have been simply a part of science fiction. Funding for robot technology and development is hard to acquire and to maintain. Robot technology needs to reach \"critical mass\" in order to break the barrier of acceptance from funding organizations. Other technologies have overcome this hurdle and, by learning from and building on their experiences, this will generate funding and acceptance to propel robot technology in support of space colonization to a much sooner reality.", "Embedded controllers are increasingly popular in industrial applications since designing flexible control modules over them can rapidly provide a finished product with a low manufacturing cost. Hence, rapid controller prototyping for embedded controller has been presented to resolve obstacles to developing controllers quickly. However, most proposed methods are prohibitively expensive and are restricted in the choice of software and hardware, thus, making them infeasible for engineering applications with the considerations of performance and cost. To solve the aforementioned problems, this study adopts MATLAB/Simulink with Real-Time Workshop as an effective means of producing a rapid controller development platform (RCDP), in which the controller model is built by the graphical drive modules, and is verified in Simulink, and the executable code correspondent to the controller model is then automatically generated and transferred to the target system for testing and verification. Experimental results indicate that the automatic generated code for third order controller with 1 ms sampling rate and actual position tracking in the X-Y table motion control can typically achieve the desired performance. Thus the proposed RCDP can effectively and practically save the development time of controller designs, particularly in the experimental course related to control theory in the education.", "The \"iCub\" is a robotic platform that was developed within the RobotCub European project to provide the cognition research community with an open \"child-like\" humanoid platform for understanding and development of cognitive systems [1].

Although both are equally critical to the effectiveness of a TRS system, past research has focused primarily on the former, while giving little thought to the latter. Not surprisingly, many successful breaks of commercial TRS systems found their first breaches at the relatively naive tamper-response modules. In this paper, we describe a novel tamper-response system that evades hacker detection by introducing delayed, probabilistic failures in a program. This is accomplished by corrupting the program's internal state at well-chosen locations. Our tamper-response system smoothly blends in with the program and leaves no noticeable traces behind, making it very difficult for a hacker to detect its existence. The paper also presents empirical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our system.", "The benefits of project-based learning environments are well documented; however, setting up and maintaining these environments can be challenging due to the high cost and expertise associated with these platforms.

Since fibroblasts can both synthesize and degrade ECM, ventricular fibroblasts from adult rat hearts underwent cyclical mechanical stretch (CMS; 0.33 Hz) by three different elongations ( 3%,6%, 9%) and four different serum concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 5%, 10%) within 24 h. Expression of collagen I and III, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP- 2), tissue inhibitor of MMP- 2 (TIMP-2), and colligin were analyzed by RNase protection assay. In the absence of serum, 9% CMS increased the mRNA of collagen I by 1.70- fold and collagen III by 1.64-fold. This increase was prevented by the inhibition either of PKC or of tyrosine kinase but not of PKA. Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase itself reduced the expression of collagen I and collagen III mRNA. The mRNA of MMP- 2, TIMP-2, and colligin showed the same tendency by stretch. Combined with 10% serum, 6% CMS reduced the mRNA of collagen I (0.62-fold) and collagen III ( 0.79fold). Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase, but not of PKA, prevented the reduction of collagen I and collagen III mRNA in 10% serum. The results show that the response of fibroblasts to CMS depends on the serum concentration. At least two signaling pathways are involved in the stretch-induced ECM regulation. Myocardial fibrosis due to ECM remodeling contributes to the dysfunction of the failing heart, which might be attributed to changes in hemodynamic loading.", "We present a human factors experiment aimed at investigating certain systematic errors in locating position cues on a rectangular array of vibrating motors. Such a task is representative of haptic signals providing supplementary information in a collaborative or guided exploration of some dataset. In this context, both the visual size and presence of correct answer reinforcement may be Subject to change. Consequently, we considered the effects of these variables oil position identification. We also investigated five types of stimulus points based Oil the stimulus' position relative to adjacent motors. As visual size increases, it initially demonstrates the dominant effect oil error magnitude, then correct answer feedback plays a role in larger sizes. Radial error, roughly the radial difference in the stimulus and response position, modeled the systematic error. We applied a quadratic fit and estimated a calibration procedure within a 2-fold cross validation.", "The use of Golay Complementary Pairs to synchronize a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel is presented in this paper. The Golay code's correlation properties make it ideal for this purpose. Golay codes have been used for synchronization before and has also been suggested for possible use in MIMO channels. However we have not seen it implemented and physically tested in the past. This paper shows the generation, simulation and implementation of such a code scheme on field programmable gate array (FPGA) and investigates it's performance on a MIMO channel. The results show excellent correlation of better than 90dB and almost perfect synchronization hence confirming that Golay codes or its complementary pair is a good candidate for MIMO synchronization.", "Although analysis in IR and IPE has increasingly started to focus on non-state actors and the information society, the role of the legal architecture of the Internet has been relatively under-analysed in terms of the structural power around communication interfaces. In this article I suggest the work of Lewis Mumford offers a useful tens for thinking about the political economy of technological change in an information society. I set out the role of intellectual property rights as the legal form of the global information society, and suggest a major challenge to this legal form is the idea of 'openness', specifically in the realm of open-source and/or free software. I examine this issue in the realm of (so-called) informational development, where major proprietary players (predominantly Microsoft) have been confronted by an increasingly vibrant open-source alternative. The open-source and free-software movements can be analysed as an emerging example of a globalised 'double movement', seeking to re-embed the tools of informational development in a societal realm of information, establishing in Mumford's terms a 'democratic technics' as a reaction to the programme of information and knowledge commodification spurred by the TRIPs agreement.", "With the ever-increasing deployment and usage of gigabit networks, traditional networks intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDSs/IPSs) have not scaled accordingly. More recently, researchers have been looking at hardware-based solutions that use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to assist network IDSs/IPSs, and some proposed systems have been developed that can be scaled to achieve a high speed over 10 Gbps. However, these solutions have certain drawbacks. In this paper, we present a uniform high-speed traffic collection platform for intrusion detection/prevention based on sampling on FPGAs, called HSTCP. The methodology is when the proposed platform is unable to capture the whole network traffic, it will initiate elephant flow sampling rather than simple packets drop. Meanwhile, the sampling rate is adaptive to the traffic load changes in the elephant flow. The noteworthy features of HSTCP include the following: (a) it takes the self-similarity of network traffic into account with complete mice flows capture and elephant flow sampling; (b) it employs adaptive elephant flow sampling to retain inherent characteristics of network traffic; and (c) it provides a flexible and scalable platform for network IDSs/IPSs faced to the challenge of the future high-speed network.", ["A set-up for the calibration of a heterodyne laser-vibrometer is described. By a distinctive optical set-up it is possible to use the laser of the device under test as the single source for the calibration device. In this way many difficulties of the optical adjustment usually encountered in set-ups for laser-vibrometer calibration are avoided and exceptionally low measurement uncertainties are achieved.", "This article describes the set-up for the case of a commercially available device which is additionally modified to provide the means for primary traceability. The measurement results are discussed for the analogue output usually used in industrial applications as well as for the output of the photodetector signal, which is used if the device is part of a primary calibration system. Special attention is given to the provisions necessary to achieve low measurement uncertainties."], "Selective marking of a single cell within a living embryo is often difficult due to the inaccuracy and invasiveness of standard techniques. This unit describes a minimally invasive optical protocol that uses 405-nm laser light to photoactivate a variant of green fluorescent protein (PAGFP). This method takes advantage of the accessibility of the chick embryo to inject PAGFP into a region of interest and uses electroporation to deliver the construct into cells. This unit describes in detail how single and small groups of cells (n<10) that express PAGFP can be made visually distinguishable from the host population using the photoactivation process. Included is a means to maximize the fluorescence increase due to photoactivated GFP signal and to reduce photobleaching. Briefly outlined are previously developed chick culture and time-lapse imaging techniques to allow for the subsequent monitoring of photoactivated cell migratory behaviors. The technique has the potential to be a less-invasive, accurate tool for in vivo studies that involve following cell lineage and cell migration.", "Distributed embedded sensor and actuator platforms will be at the core of any research initiatives on smart objects. In this context, recent developments in wireless sensing and micro-sensor technologies provide foundation platforms for considering the development of effective modular systems. They offer the prospect, currently at a prototyping level, of flexibility in use and network scalability. Wireless sensor devices are the hardware building blocks required to construct the core elements of wireless sensor networks. A number of large scale research programmes have developed over the last few years to explore these emerging technologies. We review some of the largest of these, including a review of the current wireless sensor integration technologies. This chapter will also look more closely at some of the more well-known wireless motes that are being used as toolkits for research, development and field trials.", "GJK is one of the main methods for distance calculations between convex objects. In this article, the adaptation of GJK for deformable object collision detection is proposed. Although the original method is only suited for distance calculations, the proposed method is capable of nding the colliding triangle pairs between two cotinuously deforming virtual objects in real time. Furthermore, it handles all deformation types at no extra time cost and it allows the client application to add, or remove triangles from the considered object meshes at run time with no extra overhead for the collision detection. The proposed method is very exible in many aspects, making it an ideal choice for virtual reality and haptic applications.", "The concept of trusted computing technology is becoming significant in that such technologies are being increasingly available in PCs and mobile devices. With the advent of this technology, one can move from traditional user-only based trust management systems to user and platform-based trust management systems. In this paper, we propose a TCP based trust management and negotiation framework for better security decision making. In this regard, we outline a 3-stage property model that can be leveraged to define policies of different granularities. We then propose how Trust Policy Language (TPL) can be used to create compositions of properties. Finally, the paper discusses the different architectural design choices (such as push, pull and delegation based models) in negotiating trust using these policies and their implications in a distributed web service based environment.", "An extremely simple and inexpensive modification of the Michelson interferometer is presented together with the outlines of a curriculum of physical optics. The most important experiments of optics such as diffraction, interference of light originated by one, or alternatively, by two independent sources and interference of polarized light can be easily arranged for classroom demonstrations without changing instrumentation. A simple and effective experiment to show how the resolution limit of an optical system is diffraction-limited is reported.", "At our institute we built a variety of robots. As these robots are quite different as well in size, shape and in actuation principle it would be very time consuming and inefficient to build a computer and hardware architecture especially tailored to the specific robot. In this paper it will be described how common aspects in robot control can be identified and how a modular software framework and a respective computer architecture can be mapped to modular components on the hardware side. A decentralized computer architecture based on embedded PC systems connected to local controller modules via CAN-Bus was developed. The requirements and restrictions that led to the development of these controller modules and their associated power amplifier boards will be described.", "The paper addresses the potential benefits of using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as opposed to a traditional processor for music synthesis. The benefits result from the use of a cellular design, with each cell performing identical operations on its own state and the states of its neighbours. This gives advantages of design simplicity through inherent parallelism. A cellular model which has previously been used for music synthesis is the mass spring paradigm, and this model is implemented on an FPGA. On a sequential processor, the clock speed requirements of this model increase as N-2 (where N is the number of cells), whereas the clock speed requirement increases as Non an FPGA (if the cells can be made small enough that available area on the chip is not a constraint). To make the cells small enough, a bit-serial design was used. This work was performed to advocate the FPGA as a stand-alone live performance music synthesis platform, which has the potential to be reconfigured for example in performance, between synthesis techniques as different sound patches are selected. The paper considers in particular the mass-spring model, because it demonstrates the type of music synthesis technique for which FPGAs provide the greatest potential benefit. The capability to reconfigure combined with the high performance that can be achieved using cellular design suggests that the FPGA is an ideal platform for a live performance hardware music synthesiser, combining the flexibility of software with the speed of a custom ASIC.", "In this paper, we use the software-defined radio platform GNU Radio + USRP to implement a GSM channel smart sensing system by using the wireless channel smart sensing strategy based on sequence characterizes matching method. We adopted multi-step to design the system from physical layer. First, we rough scan the signal intensity of GSM channels, then select the channel that has better signal intensity to precise scan and save the data. Then, according to the sequence characterizes of different type channel, we analysis these data and realize the utilization rate of channels.", "Typically, commercially available standard-cell libraries consist of a large set of items, including cells optimized with respect to speed, area or power consumption. A large number of cells makes the synthesis process and the library maintenance quite demanding. By using a reduced set of properly-selected cells, such efforts can be reduced, without critically affecting performance. This paper introduces an innovative library-reduction strategy, based on a evolutionary algorithm, which allows for selecting an arbitrarily small subset of cells. Library compaction is strictly related to the features of the actual synthesis tool, and is tuned by means of a large set of benchmark circuits, so that it produces results suitable for general-purpose circuit design. Different technologies were accounted for, analyzing dependence of the area, time and power figures on the library cell count. Performance, with respect to full-size library synthesis, do not appreciably degrades, and in several cases actually improves. Synthesis time decreases and library maintenance and characterization tasks can thus be significantly reduced.", "A scalable hardware/software hybrid module called Ubidule- endowed with bio-inspired ontogenetic and epigenetic features is configured to run a neural networks simulation with developmental and evolvable capabilities. We simulated the activity of hierarchically organized spiking neural networks characterized by an initial developmental phase featuring cell death followed by spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity in presence of background noise. An upstream 'sensory' network received a spatiotemporally organized external input and downstream networks were activated only via the upstream network. Precise firing sequences, formed by recurrent patterns of spikes intervals above chance levels, were observed in all recording conditions, thus suggesting the build-up of a connectivity able to sustain temporal information processing. The activity of a Ubinet -a network of Ubidules- is analyzed by means of virtual electrodes that recorded neural signals similar to EEG. The analysis of these signals was compared with a small set of human recordings and revealed common patterns of shift in quadratic phase coupling. The results suggest some interpretations of changes and plasticity of functional interactions between cortical areas driven by external stimuli and by learning/cognitive paradigms.", "In this invited editorial, professors from leading institutions in the Philippines, share information regarding their programs relating to Exercise Science. They have provided information on academic components such as entrance requirements, progression through programs, and professional opportunities available to students following completion; as well as details regarding funding available to students to participate in research, collaboration, and specific research interests.", null, "The biomechanical environment to which cells are exposed is important to their normal growth, development, interaction, and function. Accordingly, there has been much interest in studying the role of biomechanical forces in cell biology and pathophysiology. This has led to the introduction and even commercialization of many experimental devices. Many of the early devices were limited by the heterogeneity of deformation of cells cultivated in different locations of the culture plate membranes and were also attached with complicated technical/electronic efforts resulting in a restriction of the reproducibility of these devices. The objective of this study was to design and build a simple device to allow the application of dose-dependent homogeneous equibiaxial static stretch to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes to investigate biological and biomedical questions. In addition, cultured neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes were stretched with the proposed device with different strain gradients. For the first time with this study we could demonstrate that stretch up to 21% caused dose-dependent changes in biological markers such as the calcineurin activity, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, voltage-gated potassium channel isoform 4.2, and voltage-gated K+ channel-interacting proteins-2 gene expression and transient outward potassium current densities but not the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. With both markers mentioned last, dose-dependent stretch alterations could only be achieved with stretch up to 13%.

We present four rendering methods, two of which are anti-abased methods to improve display quality and smoothness. We describe three experiments to evaluate the methods. The first experiment compares them based on subjective experiment investigates the potential for one approach to communicate information at a sub-tactor resolution, based on the shortest line segment allowing identification of its direction. The third experiment is a shape discrimination experiment and finds that only one of the approaches allows reasonable discrimination for the selected shapes.", null, "Information theoretic limits for random key generation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems exhibiting a reciprocal channel response are investigated experimentally with a new three-node MIMO measurement campaign. As background, simple expressions are presented for the number of available key bits, as well as the number of bits that are secure from a close eavesdropper. Two methods for generating secret keys are analyzed in the context of MIMO channels and their mismatch rate and efficiency are derived. A new wideband indoor MIMO measurement campaign in the 2.51- to 2.59-GHz band is presented, whose purpose is to study the number of available key bits in both line-of-sight and nonline-of-sight environments. Application of the key generation methods to measured propagation channels indicates key generation rates that can be obtained in practice for four-element arrays.", "Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.", "This paper describes a compact analog computer and proposes its use in electronic engineering teaching laboratories to develop student understanding of applications in analog electronics, electronic components, engineering mathematics, control engineering, safe laboratory and workshop practices, circuit construction, testing, and maintenance.

This paper summarizes several ongoing projects to allow greater independence for people with disabilities.", "Economists often assume that a patent gives its owner a well-defined legal right to exclude others from practicing the invention described in the patent. In practice, however, the rights afforded to patent holders are highly uncertain. Under patent law, a patent is no guarantee of exclusion but more precisely a legal right to try to exclude. Since only 0.1% of all patents are litigated to trial, and since nearly half of fully litigated patents are declared invalid, this distinction is critical to understanding the economic impact of patents. The growing recognition among economists and legal scholars that patents are probabilistic property rights has significant implications for our understanding of patents in four important areas: (1) reform of the system by which patents are granted; (2) the legal treatment of patents in litigation; (3) the incentives of patent holders and alleged infringers to settle their disputes through licensing or cross-licensing agreements rather than litigate them to completion; and (4) the antitrust limits on agreements between rivals that settle actual or threatened patent litigation.", "There is growing interest in physical-layer key generation schemes that provide very strong or even perfect security in wireless communication systems. One such scheme is reciprocal channel key generation, where two nodes quantize reciprocal channel state information to generate keys. Although the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques is interesting in this case since the number of random parameters available for rapid key generation is increased, MIMO techniques may also provide more information to an eavesdropper. This work presents a new MIMO measurement campaign performed in LOS and NLOS indoor environments that studies the correlation of the channel between legitimate users with the eavesdropper channel, revealing what key generation rates can be attained in practice and what fraction of generated key bits are safe from eavesdroppers. The effect of eavesdropper separation, number of antennas, eavesdropper advantage, and covariance separability are studied.", "The author surveys the entrepreneurial and small business policies from Carter through Clinton, evaluating each based on how they fostered entrepreneurship, or small business ownership, and if these policies seek to create economic efficiency or target market equity for specific groups. It provides a theoretical framework for analyzing each administration's major small business and entrepreneurship policies and examines each policy's overall effects on small business and entrepreneurial activities, its qualifications as a target market equity or economic efficiency policy, and the policy's beneficiaries. This discussion should provide policy makers, researchers, and academics the ability to recognize the types of policies which best foster entrepreneurial and small business activities, and also encourage policy makers to pursue these types of policies.", "Both linear and nonlinear transmit precoding strategies based on accurate channel state information (CSI) can significantly increase available throughput in a multiuser wireless system. With propagation delay, infrequent channel updates, lag due to network layer overhead, and time-varying node position or environment characteristics, channel knowledge becomes outdated and CSI-based transmission schemes can experience severe performance degradation. This paper studies the performance of precoding techniques for the multiuser broadcast channel with outdated CSI at the transmitter. Traditional channel models as well as channel realizations measured by a wideband channel sounder are used in the analysis. With measured data from an outdoor urban environment, it is further shown the existence of stable subspaces upon which transmission is possible without any instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. Such transmissions allow for consistent performance curves at the cost of initial suboptimality compared to CSI-based schemes.

This study models a dual-polarized MIMO channel using the Kronecker and Weichselberger models for two different indoor environments. The author's contribution here is based on a measurement campaign employing dual-polarized 8x8 patch arrays, and is analyzed at 2.4 and 5.2 GHz, where measurements were performed in an office building and an industrial environment. The average capacities attained from the measured data is compared with that of the models. Although the Weichselberger model performs better than the Kronecker model in both environments and at both frequencies, both models are found to underestimate the measured data. The Kronecker model is known to perform poorly for large antenna sizes and the performance of the Weichselberger model can be attributed to certain parts of the channel not fading enough.", "This work explores the performance of a multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel where both the transmitter and receivers have outdated channel knowledge due to node motion or other time-variations in the communication channel. A performance analysis based on measured channel responses reveals significant throughput degradation for optimal linear and nonlinear precoding strategies unless the channel state information (CSI) is frequently fed back to the transmitter. The paper then develops a linear beamforming precoding strategy based on channel distribution information in the form of a full spatial correlation matrix for each user. This algorithm is shown to provide highly stable communication, with a throughput that is higher than that for optimal precoders operating on outdated CSI, in a time-variant environment, indicating that this approach can operate with significantly reduced feedback frequency. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the use of the well-known Kronecker and Weichselberger models to parameterize the full correlation matrix to enable further reduction in the amount of feedback data required for implementation of the new beamforming technique.", "The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.", "In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low cost.

Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of GSM protocols in general.

While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless music production system based on open hardware and open software which requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio, generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on, enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications.", null, "This paper analyzes the collective behaviors of swarm robots that play role in the aggregation scenario. Honeybee aggregation is an inspired behavior of young honeybees which tend to aggregate around an optimal zone. This aggregation is implemented based on variation of parameters values. In the second phase, two modifications on original honeybee aggregation namely dynamic velocity and comparative waiting time are proposed. Results of the performed experiments showed the significant differences in collective behavior of the swarm system for different algorithms.", "Embedded online laboratories are becoming frequent nowadays, because they can include both the functionality of a data acquisition device and the functionality of a webserver and this, in turn, results in lower implementation costs. However, while it is easy to configure a laboratory server which is located on a computer, the local configuration and control of an embedded laboratory is more challenging, because of the lack of interactive peripherals (such as the keyboard is to a computer). This paper introduces a novel concept which allows administrators to easily achieve the local configuration of the embedded (on-chip) laboratory parameters (including network settings) by using a mobile device.", "Because battery-powered nodes are required in wireless sensor networks and energy consumption represents an important design consideration, alternate energy sources are needed to provide more effective and optimal function.

The WILGA conferences take place two times a year and the participants are young scientists from this country and abroad. This paper debates chosen topical tracks and some papers presented during the 31 WILGA Multi-Conference, which took place on 8-10 February 2013 at the Faculty of WEiTI PW. The January conference was attended by around 100 persons. Here we discuss closer the subjects of biomedical photonics, electronics and informatics, as well as chosen aspects of applications of advanced photonic, electronic circuits and systems. The 32nd WILGA Symposium took place on 27 May - 02 June 2013 in WUT WILGA resort near Warsaw. These two editions of WILGA Conferences - January and May have generated more than 250 articles, from which around 100 were chosen by the Symposium and Conference Committees to be published in this volume of Proc. SPIE. WILGA Symposium papers are traditionally submitted via the WILGA web page [wilga.ise.pw.edu.pl] to the SPIE Proceedings publishing system [spie.org].

We analyze the design costs and architectures and communication costs associated with each model. We conclude that both innovation by individual users and open collaborative innovation increasingly compete with and may displace producer innovation in many parts of the economy. We explain why this represents a paradigm shift with respect to innovation research, policy making, and practice. We discuss important implications and offer suggestions for further research.", "This article examines the open paradigm in design research and introduces a new conceptualization for 'open design' and a three-layer framework to demonstrate the degrees of openness in design practices. The conceptualization comprises all stages in the design process, ranging from need-finding to the openness of the design documents and the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for open design. The article builds on an extensive literature review about studies on 'open' in design: open-source software, open hardware, and participatory methods in design, such as co-design and participatory design, and user-engagement methods such as crowdsourcing and co-creation.", "This paper presents the development and testing of an open and flexible embedded system applied to positioning and telecontrol (OFESAPO) for outdoor applications. The system is composed of a control center (CC) and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map.", "Synchrophasor measurement is increasingly becoming a standard tool of the electrical power systems engineer and is attracting much interest in the research community due to the novel new methods and techniques it offers for observing and controlling the power system. A common difficulty in the development of Synchrophasor based technology is the closed environment in which the measurement algorithms and processes governing the operation of Phasor Measurement Units, PMUs, are developed. While most PMUs will support the relevant IEEE standards for Synchrophasor measurement, where transient or dynamic operation is concerned it would be useful to have detailed knowledge of the mathematical transforms and indeed any limitations of the measurement hardware. This can be especially important in developing new protection systems utilizing Synchrophasors, when confidence in the system rests on consistent performance between devices over a long period of service, including device upgrades. The \"OpenPMU\" described in this paper intends to settle some of these concerns by defining and developing a research orientated platform for Synchrophasor algorithm and application development.", ["Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe how 3D printing and scanning technology was implemented by the Dalhousie University Libraries in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

This paper sets the groundwork for further exploration into how 3D technologies can improve and expand library services."], "Typical experiments in psychological and neurophysiological settings often require the accurate control of multiple input and output signals. These signals are often generated or recorded via computer software and/or external dedicated hardware. Dedicated hardware is usually very expensive and requires additional software to control its behavior. In the present article, I present some accuracy tests on a low-cost and open-source I/O board (Arduino family) that may be useful in many lab environments. One of the strengths of Arduinos is the possibility they afford to load the experimental script on the board's memory and let it run without interfacing with computers or external software, thus granting complete independence, portability, and accuracy. Furthermore, a large community has arisen around the Arduino idea and offers many hardware add-ons and hundreds of free scripts for different projects. Accuracy tests show that Arduino boards may be an inexpensive tool for many psychological and neurophysiological labs.", "Humanoid robotics is a field of a great research interest nowadays. This work implements a low-cost teleoperated system to control a humanoid robot, as a first step for further development and study of human motion and walking. A human suit is built, consisting of 8 sensors, 6 resistive linear potentiometers on the lower extremities and 2 digital accelerometers for the arms. The goal is to replicate the suit movements in a small humanoid robot. The data from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted via two ZigBee RF configurable modules installed on each device: the robot and the suit. Replicating the suit movements requires a robot stability control module to prevent falling down while executing different actions involving knees flexion. This is carried out via a feedback control system with an accelerometer placed on the robot's back. The measurement from this sensor is filtered using Kalman. In addition, a two input fuzzy algorithm controlling five servo motors regulates the robot balance. The humanoid robot is controlled by a medium capacity processor and a low computational cost is achieved for executing the different algorithms. Both hardware and software of the system are based on open platforms. The successful experiments carried out validate the implementation of the proposed teleoperated system.", null, "The fusion of Biomedical Technology, Informatics and Medical Decision-making into the modern Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), as well as the population ageing and the escalation of hospital costs are the driving forces for adopting decentralized systems of health care provision. One of the main problems arising with decentralized health care provision, such as Home Care, is the discontinuity of medical care. This discontinuity appears not only in medical data transfer, but also in the quality of medical supervision. In order to accommodate for the lack of sufficient medical supervision in Home-Care environment, we have developed low-cost prototype solution for monitoring basic physiological parameters. The implemented architecture is employing wearable biomedical signal acquisition modules, utilizing \"off the shelf\" technologies in order to minimize cost.

Their design, optimized for a wide range of radio astronomical applications, is presented. Developed for operation with the GREAT far infrared heterodyne spectrometer on-board SOFIA, the eXtended bandwidth FFTS (XFFTS) offers a high instantaneous bandwidth of 2.5GHz with 88.5 kHz spectral resolution and has been in routine operation during SOFIA's Basic Science since July 2011.

For five years, this was the most affordable method for connecting computers. The development of this technology was guided by the idea that it should be controlled by its users. With reference to this experiment, it is argued that a shared ethical and/or political vision can contribute to the establishment of norms within user communities encouraging their members to share information with each other. Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question. Particular focus is placed on the tension between, on one hand, the norms and ethical-political motives of the user community, and, on the other hand, the needs satisfied through product development, both stemming from the same innovation process.", "Because battery-powered nodes are required in wireless sensor networks and energy consumption represents an important design consideration, alternate energy sources are needed to provide more effective and optimal function.

A new emerging group of these devices is the wearable devices, and the wireless sensor networks are a good way to integrate them in the IoT concept and bring new experiences to the daily life activities. In this paper, we present an everyday life application involving a WSN as the base of a novel context-awareness sports scenario, where physiological parameters are measured and sent to the WSN by wearable devices. Applications with several hardware components introduce the problem of heterogeneity in the network. In order to integrate different hardware platforms and to introduce a service-oriented semantic middleware solution into a single application, we propose the use of an enterprise service bus (ESB) as a bridge for guaranteeing interoperability and integration of the different environments, thus introducing a semantic added value needed in the world of IoT-based systems. This approach places all the data acquired (e. g., via internet data access) at application developers disposal, opening the system to new user applications.

This prompted an outpouring of research work related to CR, including the publication of more than 30 special issue scientific journals and more than 60 dedicated conferences and workshops. Although the theoretical research is blooming, with many interesting results presented, hardware and system development for CR is progressing at a slower pace.

They generate digital footprints that reveal the activity in the city over time and space, making possible a quantitative analysis of movements using bicycles in the city. A careful study relying on nonstationary statistical modeling and data mining allows us to first model the time evolution of the dynamics of movements with Velo'v, that is mostly cyclostationary over the week with nonstationary evolutions over larger time-scales, and second to disentangle the spatial patterns to understand and visualize the flows of Velo'v bicycles in the city. This study gives insights on the social behaviors of the users of this intermodal transportation system, the objective being to help in designing and planning policy in urban transportation.", "Over the last five decades, progress in neural recording techniques has allowed the number of simultaneously recorded neurons to double approximately every 7 years, mimicking Moore's law. Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.", "Dual sideband (2SB) receivers are well suited for the spectral observation of complex astronomical signals over a wide frequency range. They are extensively used in radio astronomy, their main advantages being to avoid spectral confusion and to diminish effective system temperature by a factor 2 with respect to double sideband (DSB) receivers. Using available millimeter-wave analog technology, wideband 2SB receivers generally obtain sideband rejection ratios (SRR) of 10-15 dB, insufficient for a number of astronomical applications. We report here the design and implementation of an FPGA-based sideband separating FFT spectrometer. A 4 GHz analog front end was built to test the design and measure sideband rejection. The setup uses a 2SB front end architecture, except that the mixer outputs are directly digitized before the IF hybrid, using two 8 bit ADCs sampling at 1 GSPS. The IF hybrid is implemented on the FPGA together with a set of calibration vectors that, properly chosen, compensate for the analog front end amplitude and phase imbalances. The calibrated receiver exhibits a sideband rejection ratio in excess of 40 dB for the entire 2 GHz RF bandwidth.", "In this paper we discuss results and observations based on empirical studies of introducing programming using Scratch-Arduino to high school students. We analyse the programming experience of students across diverse educational and economic backgrounds, culture and region. Learning of key programming and electronics concepts was measured during the exercise. Results indicate that these fundamentals can be imparted at high schools in the Indian educational context. We find that the introduction of logic programming and computer-hardware interfacing at the high school level is advantageous in terms of creating an interactive environment fostering learning and creativity.", "We are entering a new era in our ability to modify and edit the genomes of model organisms. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) opened the door to the first custom nuclease-targeted genome engineering in the late 1990s. However, ZFNs remained out of reach for most research labs because of the difficulty of production, high costs, and modest efficacy in many applications. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were built upon a DNA binding system discovered in a group of plant bacterial pathogens and broadened custom nuclease technology, showing significant improvements in both targeting flexibility and efficiency. Perhaps most importantly, TALENs are open source and easy to produce, providing zebrafish laboratories around the world with affordable tools that can be made in-house rapidly, at low cost, and with reliably high activity. Now a new system for targeted genome engineering derived from the CRISPR/Cas system in eubacteria and archaea promises to simplify this process further. Together, these tools will help overcome many of the bottlenecks that have constrained gene targeting in zebrafish, paving the way for advanced genome engineering applications in this model teleost.", "Two Australian researchers specializing in China's creative industries examine recent developments in southern China commonly associated with the shanzhai phenomenon (e. g., production and sale of cheap local facsimiles of globally branded goods). While shanzhai is often condemned as the embodiment of China's \"knock-off\" industries, the authors argue that it might be more appropriately viewed as an instance of China's emerging creative economy and an example of rapid prototyping. The paper traces the evolution of shanzhai mobile phones and the materialization of the shanzhai ethos in popular culture. In arguing that shanzhai provides inputs into creative industries, the paper describes the fuzzy boundary between formal and informal culture and notes the interaction between three spheres of activity: official culture, the market, and grassroots culture.

Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs).

Composing 'outside' electronics is regarded as a method for revealing processes that can be represented in other areas of the work beyond sound-generating circuits.

Through the sharing of information online and in workshops, the DIY community has become knowledgeable, which has resulted in a community 'full of experts' and the growth of custom-designed circuits. The rise of discrete hand-held music players, such as the Buddha Machine, and the boutique synthesiser are also discussed, and the physical artefact and sound object are seen as a vehicle for the dissemination of ideas.

LDI can measure the particle velocity of a small (0.03 mm(2)) element of the surface of the sample along the direction of the laser beam. By measuring the particle velocity of the same surface element in three linearly independent directions and then transforming those velocities to Cartesian coordinates, three orthogonal components of the particle-velocity vector are obtained. Thus, LDI can be used as a localized three-component (3C) receiver of ultrasonic waves, and, together with a piezoelectric transducer as a source, it can simulate a 3C seismic experiment in the laboratory. Performing such 3C measurements at various locations on the surface of the sample produces a 3C seismogram, which can be used to separate the P-wave and two S-waves and to find the polarizations and traveltimes of those waves. Then, the elasticity tensor of the medium can be obtained by minimizing the misfit between measured and predicted polarizations and traveltimes. Computation of the polarizations and traveltimes of body waves inside a sample with a given elasticity tensor is based on the Christoffel equation. The predicted polarizations on the surface then are obtained using the anisotropic Zoeppritz equations. The type of velocity measured (phase or group velocity) depends on the acquisition geometry and the material properties. This is taken into account in the inversion procedure.

This advance over current designs is achieved by a novel spring-based drive mechanism that reduces implant weight and complexity.

This paper proposes a generic architecture, containing multiple processors, that allows easy integration of custom and/or predefined peripherals. The architecture allows students to explore both the hardware and software issues associated with real-time and embedded systems. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended to train students in advanced concepts in embedded multiprocessor systems. This generic architecture has been used for two courses at the National University of Singapore-one on real-time embedded systems and the other emphasizing the hardware aspects of embedded systems. The project in the real-time embedded systems course has students develop a five-a-side soccer system on multiple field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards using embedded processors. In the embedded hardware design course project, students use an embedded processor-based system to perform decryption of a block encrypted image, accelerated through a custom co-processor. The use of displays gives students a visual/interactive experience and a sense of accomplishment, while reinforcing the theoretical concepts. Both qualitative and quantitative assessment results are presented, showing how students perceived these projects and met the learning objectives.", "The low cost, simple, robust, mobile, and easy to use Mobile Motion Capture (MiMiC) system is presented and the constraints which guided the design of MiMiC are discussed.

MiMiC is cost effective and can be used for an entire day in a person's daily routine without being intrusive.

A robot can provide assistance with these tasks by moving its end effector to poses near the care-receiver's body. However, perceiving and maneuvering around the care-receiver's body can be challenging due to a variety of issues, including convoluted geometry, compliant materials, body motion, hidden surfaces, and the object upon which the body is resting (e.g., a wheelchair or bed). Using geometric simulations, we first show that an assistive robot can achieve a much larger percentage of end-effector poses near the care-receiver's body if its arm is allowed to make contact. Second, we present a novel system with a custom controller and whole-arm tactile sensor array that enables a Willow Garage PR2 to regulate contact forces across its entire arm while moving its end effector to a commanded pose. We then describe tests with two people with motor impairments, one of whom used the system to grasp and pull a blanket over himself and to grab a cloth and wipe his face, all while in bed at his home. Finally, we describe a study with eight able-bodied users in which they used the system to place objects near their bodies. On average, users perceived the system to be safe and comfortable, even though substantial contact occurred between the robot's arm and the user's body.", "The work presented in this paper is part of a larger initiative to develop a Geo-based Load Forecasting (GLF) methodology for distribution master planning in South Africa. Part of the planning process, is forecasting the peak load for a geographical area with a given load class composition. This forecast is used to plan the capacity and timeline of infrastructure to service that area. In this paper, an overview of the GLF peak load estimation technique is provided as background. A Monte Carlo simulation based approach to evaluate the accuracy of this method was developed and is presented. Using the simulation, an evaluation of the current method and load library was completed and the results show that the current method significantly under-estimates the peak load. This can be attributed to changes in the load profile shapes of customers since 2007 when the current load profile library was derived, as well as simplifications in the derivation of the customer load behaviour. Specifically, the differences between the load behaviours of customers within a specific load class is ignored. An enhancement to the geo-based method is presented and compares well with simulated results across different customer classes and load aggregation periods. This improvement reflects the customer load behaviour more accurately and can readily be incorporated as part of the distribution master planning process.", "http://DlYbio.org (Do It Yourself Biology) is an online site and a digital brand subscribed to local groups of amateur biologists worldwide. Despite of making up a rather heterogeneous public, DIYbio groups are organized around a concern to make biology accessible, easy and enjoyable. DlYbio combines an open source ethos, with a DIY will to do things and the joy to mess with biological matter. As biohacking is about de-composing and re-composing things, DIYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new and to the making of futures that this paper explores. Inspired by Heidegger's notion of the thing, I suggest that differing from institutionalized forms of biology, DlYbio produces things rather than techno-objects. I go into this point by first situating DIYbio in relation to synthetic biology and other instutionalised forms of biology. To explore how DlYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new, I look at a number of things that DlYbio groups have projected, designed and realized. I suggest that DlYbio combines a sort of individual craftiness and self-determination to do things with a praxis in which things are always in the making, waiting for the next realization. DIYbio take on an approach to the making of things and futures that is immediate and mundane. Yet, as an emerging public, DlYbio relies on an ambiguous relation to institutionalized science, and might be turned into a transfer of materialities and temporalities from public domains to science.

Whilst this form of media access control brings several timeliness benefits, studies have also illustrated negative effects on transmission reliability. This paper extends the 'window transmission' technique which was recently proposed by the authors to help overcome this problem in TDMA-based networks to include the effects of correlated (burst) errors. This paper employs a simple Markov model to describe burst error behaviors in a CAN network, and the model is used to develop an algorithm for calculating TDMA slot sizes which aim to provide prespecified statistical guarantees of message delivery. Computational results are presented which indicate that the technique can reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for specified reliability levels by a significant factor when compared to the use of message duplicates. The paper is concluded with an empirical study which provides further supportive evidence for the described technique.", "The rising popularity of location-based services has prompted considerable research in the field of indoor location systems. Since there is no single technology to support these systems, it is necessary to consider the fusion of the information coming from heterogeneous sensors.

The architecture was designed to be used by different kinds of actors independently and with mutual transparency: hardware administrators, algorithm developers and user applications.

Sizing the internal architecture to sustain the peak load may lead to power inefficiency at low loads. This paper presents a power saving scheme to improve the power efficiency of the MSSR by dynamically adapting the size of its internal architecture to the offered load to reduce power needs. The off-line problem is defined as a mixed integer linear programming optimization model, shown to be NP-hard. We propose a differential on-line heuristic to solve the optimization problem when the traffic load changes. The heuristic avoids the complete MSSR reconfiguration of the optimal off-line solution that may lead to forwarding delay increase or service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed on-line algorithm, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserves the load proportional power demand characteristics of the optimal off-line solution.", "Rapid prototyping of medically assistive mobile devices promises to fuel innovation and provides opportunity for hands-on engineering training in biomedical engineering curricula.

However, as most of the proposed approaches are suitable for outdoor operation, only a few techniques have been designed for indoor environments, where the systems cannot rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and, therefore, have to use their exteroceptive sensors for navigation. In this paper, we present a general navigation system that enables a small-sized quadrotor system to autonomously operate in indoor environments. To achieve this, we systematically extend and adapt techniques that have been successfully applied on ground robots. We describe all algorithms and present a broad set of experiments, which illustrate that they enable a quadrotor robot to reliably and autonomously navigate in indoor environments.", "Performance and total cost of ownership (TCO) are key optimization metrics in large-scale data centers.

The ETHZ haptic paddle was developed for a new pHRI course offered in the undergraduate Mechatronics Focus track of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Twenty students engaged in this 2-h weekly lecture over the 14 weeks of the Autumn 2011 semester, complemented by a weekly 2-h laboratory session with the ETHZ haptic paddle. In pairs, students worked through three common sets of experiments before embarking on a specialization project that investigated one of several advanced topics such as impedance control with force feedback, admittance control, the effect of velocity estimation on stability, or electromyographic control. For these projects, students received additional hardware, including force sensors, electrooptical encoders or high-performance data acquisition cards. The learning objectives were developed in the context of an accompanying faculty development program at ETH Zurich; a set of interactive sequences and the oral exam were explicitly aligned to these learning objectives. The outcomes of the specialization project presentations and oral exams, and a student evaluation of the course, demonstrated that the ETHZ haptic paddle is a valuable tool that allows students to quite literally grasp abstract principles such as mechanical impedance, passivity, and human factors and helps students create a tangible link between theory and practice in the highly interdisciplinary field of pHRI.", "The interdisciplinary nature of robotics allows mobile robots to be used successfully in a broad range of courses at the postgraduate level and in Ph.D. research.

The infrastructure was built around EPOS' second generation of motes, which features an ARM processor and an IEEE 802.15.4 radio transceiver. It is presented to end users through a trustful communication protocol stack compatible with TCP/IP. Trustfulness was tackled at MAC level by extending C-MAC, EPOS native MAC protocol, with AES capabilities that were used to encrypt and authenticate IP datagrams packets.

This frequently results in the students early disengagement from the subject of their degrees which in turn can lead to excessive wastage, that is, reduced retention. In this paper, we report on our academic groups attempts within creative computing degrees at a UK university to counter these problems through the introduction of a 6 week long project that newly enrolled students embark on at the very beginning of their studies. This group project, involving the creation of a 3D etch-a-sketch-like computer graphics application with a hardware interface, provides a breadth-first, activity-led introduction to the students chosen academic discipline, aiming to increase student engagement while providing a stimulating learning experience with the overall goal to increase retention. We present the methods and results of two iterations of these projects in the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 academic years, and conclude that the approach worked well for these cohorts, with students expressing increased interest in their chosen discipline, in addition to noticeable improvements in retention following the first year of the students studies.", "Although several brain regions show significant specialization, higher functions such as cross-modal information integration, abstract reasoning and conscious awareness are viewed as emerging from interactions across distributed functional networks. Analytical approaches capable of capturing the properties of such networks can therefore enhance our ability to make inferences from functional MRI, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the formal modelling of networks and offers a wide range of theoretical tools to quantify specific features of network architecture (topology) that can provide information complementing the anatomical localization of areas responding to given stimuli or tasks (topography). Explicit modelling of the architecture of axonal connections and interactions among areas can furthermore reveal peculiar topological properties that are conserved across diverse biological networks, and highly sensitive to disease states. The field is evolving rapidly, partly fuelled by computational developments that enable the study of connectivity at fine anatomical detail and the simultaneous interactions among multiple regions. Recent publications in this area have shown that graph-based modelling can enhance our ability to draw causal inferences from functional MRI experiments, and support the early detection of disconnection and the modelling of pathology spread in neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, neurophysiological studies have shown that network topology has a profound link to epileptogenesis and that connectivity indices derived from graph models aid in modelling the onset and spread of seizures. Graph-based analyses may therefore significantly help understand the bases of a range of neurological conditions. This review is designed to provide an overview of graph-based analyses of brain connectivity and their relevance to disease aimed principally at general neuroscientists and clinicians.

We study DVS theoretically as well as in a practical manner, i.e., we using a prototype implementation of a DVS capable wireless sensor node. With the theoretical considerations we were able to optimize DVS for an 8-Bit ULP micro controller by a combination of DVS and dynamic power management (DPM). In addition, we proved the calculated results with an extensive practical evaluation of the concept using a prototypical implementation. Moreover, we analysed the effect of voltage scaling on other components of the sensor node (transceiver, sensors and memory)."], "Most approaches to recognize human activities rely on pattern recognition techniques that are trained once at design time, and then remain unchanged during usage. This reflects the assumption that the mapping between sensor signal patterns and activity classes is known at design-time. This cannot be guaranteed in mobile and pervasive computing, where unpredictable changes can often occur in open-ended environments. Run-time adaptation can address these issues. We introduce and formalize a data processing architecture extending current approaches that allows for a wide range of realizations of adaptive activity recognition systems. The adaptive activity recognition chain (adARC) includes self-monitoring, adaptation strategies and external feedback as components of the now closed-loop recognition system. We show an adARC capable of unsupervised self-adaptation to run-time changing class distributions. It improves activity recognition accuracy when sensors suffer from on-body displacement. We show an adARC capable of adaptation to changing sensor setups. It allows for scalability by enabling a recognition systems to autonomously exploit newly introduced sensors. We discuss other adaptive recognition systems within the adARC architecture. The results outline that this architecture frames a useful solution space for the real-world deployment of adaptive activity recognition systems. It allows to present and compare recognition systems in a coherent and modular manner.

However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

Analysis of these performance gains is based on actual data throughput and channel-state measurements of an airborne 4x4 MIMO-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Practical realization of these performance gains with a coded-OFDM wideband system was accomplished through airborne field trials across multiple flight profiles. We show through experimental validation that average MIMO throughput gains in excess of 2x can be achieved relative to a SISO system. These field trials also indicate that MIMO processing can deliver a 1.6x increase in the range of the link. Additionally, if channel-state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter - which enables MIMO eigen beamforming - the average throughput gain can be further increased to 4.5x and the link range can be increased by as much as 3.6x. It is also shown that for a 4x4 MIMO system to deliver the same throughput performance as a conventional SISO system in an air-to-ground environment, a relative TX power savings of up to 21 dB can be realized.", "In this paper we provide the fundamentals and a proof of concept for a completely new approach in multi-modular self-reconfigurable mobile robotics. The architecture described consists of two main parts being strongly interconnected. The first part is the development of an architecture based upon a high-speed fully switched Ethernet-network. This approach contrasts the way existing platforms were designed. The use of a switched Ethernet-network, instead of commonly used bus-systems, depicts a paradigm change in this field of robotics. The second part stipulates a strict decomposition of the robot module into various submodules. A powerful main-CPU, running a mu Clinux, represents the central entity of the architecture. It is supported by several peripheral microcontrollers, which perform low-level tasks and data preprocessing only. The submodules are treated as blackboxes, being independant from each other, only loosely coupled by a local SPI-bus. This results in a more robust and manageable system.

We propose a new means to mitigate the effects of NBTI on SRAM-based register files, which are particularly vulnerable due to their small structure size and are under continuous voltage stress for prolonged intervals. The conducted results from our technology simulator demonstrate the severity of NBTI effects on the SRAM cells - especially when process variation is taken into account. Based on the presented analysis, we show that NBTI stress in different registers needs to be tackled using different strategies corresponding to their access patterns. To this end, we propose to selectively increase the resilience of individual registers against NBTI. Our technique balances the gate voltage stress of the two PMOS transistors of an SRAM cell such that both are under stress for approximately the same amount of time during operation thereby minimizing the deleterious effects of NBTI. We present mitigation implementations in both hardware and in software along with the incurred overhead. Through a wide range of applications we can show that our technique reduces the NBTI-induced reliability degradation by 35% on average. This is 22% better than current State-of-the-Art.", "This article takes the political engagement of hackers as a prism for examining the relations between technological determinist thinking and collective action. The concept collective action framing' is borrowed from social movement theory to describe how hackers have appropriated notions of a post-industrial, information society in their struggles against intellectual property laws and state censorship. Hackers have reintroduced an element of conflict and antagonism into otherwise politically innocuous visions of post-industrialism. This residual of antagonism can be traced back to the roots of the post-industrial myth in Marxist, historical materialist theory. By exploring these origins, the article proceeds to compare the hopes invested by hackers in the emancipatory force of information technology with the earlier beliefs of labour movements that the forces of history were on their side. Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.", null, "This paper proposes two methods for UAV translational velocity estimation based on onboard sensing only. Spherical image measurements provided by a single onboard camera along with IMU data consist the main information feeding the estimators.

Differently with respect to existing approaches, the velocity is directly estimated from the onboard image without the need to fully estimate the vehicle 3D pose. The low computational requirement makes the proposed techniques suitable for applications where the execution time is of prominent importance even if no powerful hardware is available, as it is the case with UAV systems.

The first is addressed by techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The next stage of navigating is to plan a path to a goal, which is often achieved by learning techniques due to the scale of search required. Commonly, the localisation and mapping stage is separated from path planning stage, with the function not of interest being considered ideal in order to simplify the problem (similarly, the goal is often predetermined by an external agent, such as a human operator specifying a location to reach). This work integrates the planning with the localisation and mapping in order to investigate the benefits of considering these aspects together (rather than as a separate functions as is often assumed). Firstly, experiments on real-robots show decreased localisation error in this approach (1.8 mm +/- 0.41 mm to 1.2 mm +/- 0.26 mm). Secondly, the number of steps to goal has concurrently been reduced (13.4 steps to 11.8 steps). This work is novel in the integration of evolutionary computation planning techniques with SLAM. It also has enabled the opportunity for rule-sharing between heterogeneous robots and the inclusion of action policies in SLAM filter updates.", "This paper presents a novel multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel sounding technique with a fully parallel transceiver architecture that employs a layered scheme of frequency and space-time division multiplexing.

Using computer simulations, the measurement accuracy in the presence of IQI and PN is evaluated using the normalized mean square error, which provides a design guideline for the realization of hardware.", ["There has been a considerable body of research devoted to the design and performance of PC based software routers running open source software. Most of the research on open software routers (OSRs) have focused on improving the performance of single PCs with a few proposals for a distributed design. Modern routers are equipped with enhanced functionality such as QoS features in addition to packet forwarding. However, providing enhanced functionality in distributed OSR architectures has largely remained unaddressed.

UAVs are teleoperated robots used in various situations, including disaster area inspection and movie content creation. This study aimed to integrate humans and machines with different abilities (i.e., flying) to virtually augment human abilities. Precise manipulation of UAVs normally involves simultaneous control of motion parameters and requires the skill of a trained operator. This paper proposes a new method that directly connects the user's body and head motion to that of the UAV. The user's natural movement can be synchronized with UAV motions such as rotation and horizontal and vertical movements. Users can control the UAV more intuitively since such manipulations are more in accordance with their kinesthetic imagery; in other words, a user can feel as if he or she became a flying machine.", "A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-domain channel measurement methodology is presented.

It focuses on the Indonesian new media art community, The House of Natural Fiber (HONF), as a historically and socially specific interpretation of four key avant-garde principles: to break with the autonomy of art, engage with the praxis of life, provide utopian visions, and present aesthetic innovation. The HONF art projects explore the interaction between life, art, science and technology in both practical and aesthetic ways. They not only reflect on the tremendous impact of communication media and other technology on social and natural environments in Indonesia and worldwide, but they also provide scenarios for alternative ways of dealing with these environments. Aesthetically, they are innovative in their exploration of the field of presentation rather than representation.", "Among various approaches to eye tracking systems, light-reflection based systems with non-imaging sensors, e.g., photodiodes or phototransistors, are known to have relatively low complexity; yet, they provide moderately accurate estimation of the point of gaze. In this paper, a low-computational approach on gaze estimation is proposed using the Eye Touch system, which is a light-reflection based eye tracking system, previously introduced by the authors. Based on the physical implementation of Eye Touch, the sensor measurements are now utilized in low-computational least-squares algorithms to estimate arbitrary gaze directions, unlike the existing light reflection-based systems, including the initial Eye Touch implementation, where only limited predefined regions were distinguished. The system also utilizes an effective pattern classification algorithm to be able to perform left, right, and double clicks based on respective eye winks with significantly high accuracy. In order to avoid accuracy problems for sensitive sensor biasing hardware, a robust custom microcontroller-based data acquisition system is developed. Consequently, the physical size and cost of the overall Eye Touch system are considerably reduced while the power efficiency is improved. The results of the experimental analysis over numerous subjects clearly indicate that the proposed eye tracking system can classify eye winks with 98% accuracy, and attain an accurate gaze direction with an average angular error of about 0.93. Due to its lightweight structure, competitive accuracy and low-computational requirements relative to video-based eye tracking systems, the proposed system is a promising human-computer interface for both stationary and mobile eye tracking applications.", "In this paper, a system architecture designed to distribute radio frequency (RF) signals in an Ethernet-based network is proposed.

Climbing requires a complex skill set for successful and safe exercising. While elite climbers receive intensive expert coaching to refine this skill set, this progression approach is not viable for the amateur population. We have developed ClimbAX - a climbing performance analysis system that aims for replicating expert assessments and thus represents a first step towards an automatic coaching system for climbing enthusiasts. Through an accelerometer based wearable sensing platform, climber's movements are captured. An automatic analysis procedure detects climbing sessions and moves, which form the basis for subsequent performance assessment. The assessment parameters are derived from sports science literature and include: power, control, stability, speed. ClimbAX was evaluated in a large case study with 53 climbers under competition settings. We report a strong correlation between predicted scores and official competition results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our automatic skill assessment system.", "Estimating the input-output behavior of low voltage powerline channels for indoor high speed data communications requires the availability of proper wideband channel sounding tools. In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces. Some of its specific applications, namely the estimation of the time-varying transfer function of an indoor powerline channel and the evaluation of the power spectral density of the noise affecting it, are illustrated to show the potentialities of the developed equipment.", "Meteor radar data are continuously collected by different radar systems that operate throughout the year. Analyzing this fast growing, large data set requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently most meteor echo routines search for underdense meteor trails, often discarding overdense and nonspecular meteor trails. This is because their main purpose is the study of mesospheric winds. But the study of meteor flux requires the unique identification of each type of meteor reflections. In this paper, a multilayer radar detection and classification algorithm is proposed to correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector. In this step, we start by selecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in order to detect all types of radar echoes; however, a high probability offalse alarm is often produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data collected from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas, Puerto Rico, on April 5, 1998. A total of 270 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, nonspecular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 50% of the labeled echoes as training samples and divided the rest 50% testing samples as 10 subsets for testing. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples. Details concerning implementation, feature extraction, and data visualization are presented and discussed.", null, "Aircraft with modular airframe components may offer significant flexibility in mission performance by enabling reconfiguration between sorties.

By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.", "The open hardware mobile manipulator (OHMM) is a new open platform with a unique combination of features for teaching robotics software and algorithms.

Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays.

Due to major modifications ASDEX Upgrade is still in operation. Infrastructure like data acquisition, workstations, etc. is being modernized, interfaces like RS-232 are vanishing and new interfaces are being introduced. This leads to the necessity to adapt old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced.

One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring.

For five years, this was the most affordable method for connecting computers. The development of this technology was guided by the idea that it should be controlled by its users. With reference to this experiment, it is argued that a shared ethical and/or political vision can contribute to the establishment of norms within user communities encouraging their members to share information with each other. Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question. Particular focus is placed on the tension between, on one hand, the norms and ethical-political motives of the user community, and, on the other hand, the needs satisfied through product development, both stemming from the same innovation process.", "Synchrophasor measurement is increasingly becoming a standard tool of the electrical power systems engineer and is attracting much interest in the research community due to the novel new methods and techniques it offers for observing and controlling the power system. A common difficulty in the development of Synchrophasor based technology is the closed environment in which the measurement algorithms and processes governing the operation of Phasor Measurement Units, PMUs, are developed. While most PMUs will support the relevant IEEE standards for Synchrophasor measurement, where transient or dynamic operation is concerned it would be useful to have detailed knowledge of the mathematical transforms and indeed any limitations of the measurement hardware. This can be especially important in developing new protection systems utilizing Synchrophasors, when confidence in the system rests on consistent performance between devices over a long period of service, including device upgrades.

For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map.", "In this paper, we assess the economic viability of innovation by producers relative to two increasingly important alternative models: innovations by single-user individuals or firms and open collaborative innovation.

Perhaps most importantly, TALENs are open source and easy to produce, providing zebrafish laboratories around the world with affordable tools that can be made in-house rapidly, at low cost, and with reliably high activity.

Wheel-based mobile robots are often equipped with 2D or 3D laser range finders that cover the 2D workspace sufficiently accurate and at a high rate. Micro UAV platforms operate in a 3D environment, but the restricted payload prohibits the use of fast state-of-the-art 3D sensors. Thus, perception of small obstacles is often only possible in the vicinity of the UAV and a fast collision avoidance system is necessary. We propose a reactive collision avoidance system based on artificial potential fields, that takes the special dynamics of UAVs into account by predicting the influence of obstacles on the estimated trajectory in the near future using a learned motion model. Experimental evaluation shows that the prediction leads to smoother trajectories and allows to navigate collision-free through passageways.", "Improving the machining efficiency of CNC machine tools by introducing intelligence is now gaining more attention from both researchers and entrepreneurs.

Composing 'outside' electronics is regarded as a method for revealing processes that can be represented in other areas of the work beyond sound-generating circuits. The article also looks at how building circuits and sound devices acts as a way to create a tabula rasa, and how the idea of delegated performance, where instruments are played by 'non-experts', serves to establish a naive approach and authenticity in performance. Through the sharing of information online and in workshops, the DIY community has become knowledgeable, which has resulted in a community 'full of experts' and the growth of custom-designed circuits. The rise of discrete hand-held music players, such as the Buddha Machine, and the boutique synthesiser are also discussed, and the physical artefact and sound object are seen as a vehicle for the dissemination of ideas.

Despite of making up a rather heterogeneous public, DIYbio groups are organized around a concern to make biology accessible, easy and enjoyable. DlYbio combines an open source ethos, with a DIY will to do things and the joy to mess with biological matter. As biohacking is about de-composing and re-composing things, DIYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new and to the making of futures that this paper explores. Inspired by Heidegger's notion of the thing, I suggest that differing from institutionalized forms of biology, DlYbio produces things rather than techno-objects. I go into this point by first situating DIYbio in relation to synthetic biology and other instutionalised forms of biology. To explore how DlYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new, I look at a number of things that DlYbio groups have projected, designed and realized. I suggest that DlYbio combines a sort of individual craftiness and self-determination to do things with a praxis in which things are always in the making, waiting for the next realization. DIYbio take on an approach to the making of things and futures that is immediate and mundane. Yet, as an emerging public, DlYbio relies on an ambiguous relation to institutionalized science, and might be turned into a transfer of materialities and temporalities from public domains to science.

Considerable custom engineering is required to ensure hardware and software prototypes work robustly, and recruiting and managing more than a handful of households can be difficult and cost-prohibitive. To lower the barrier to developing and evaluating new technologies for the home environment, we call for the development of a shared infrastructure, called HomeLab. HomeLab consists of a large number of geographically distributed households, each running a common, flexible framework (e.g., HomeOS [4]) in which experiments are implemented. The use of a common framework enables engineering effort, along with experience and expertise, to be shared among many research groups. Recruitment of households to HomeLab can be organic: as a research group recruits (a few) households to participate in its field study, these households can be invited to join HomeLab and participate in future studies conducted by other groups. As the pool of households participating in HomeLab grows, we hope that researchers will find it easier to recruit a large number of households to participate in field studies.", "The work presented in this paper is part of a larger initiative to develop a Geo-based Load Forecasting (GLF) methodology for distribution master planning in South Africa. Part of the planning process, is forecasting the peak load for a geographical area with a given load class composition. This forecast is used to plan the capacity and timeline of infrastructure to service that area. In this paper, an overview of the GLF peak load estimation technique is provided as background. A Monte Carlo simulation based approach to evaluate the accuracy of this method was developed and is presented. Using the simulation, an evaluation of the current method and load library was completed and the results show that the current method significantly under-estimates the peak load. This can be attributed to changes in the load profile shapes of customers since 2007 when the current load profile library was derived, as well as simplifications in the derivation of the customer load behaviour. Specifically, the differences between the load behaviours of customers within a specific load class is ignored. An enhancement to the geo-based method is presented and compares well with simulated results across different customer classes and load aggregation periods.

LDI can measure the particle velocity of a small (0.03 mm(2)) element of the surface of the sample along the direction of the laser beam. By measuring the particle velocity of the same surface element in three linearly independent directions and then transforming those velocities to Cartesian coordinates, three orthogonal components of the particle-velocity vector are obtained. Thus, LDI can be used as a localized three-component (3C) receiver of ultrasonic waves, and, together with a piezoelectric transducer as a source, it can simulate a 3C seismic experiment in the laboratory. Performing such 3C measurements at various locations on the surface of the sample produces a 3C seismogram, which can be used to separate the P-wave and two S-waves and to find the polarizations and traveltimes of those waves. Then, the elasticity tensor of the medium can be obtained by minimizing the misfit between measured and predicted polarizations and traveltimes. Computation of the polarizations and traveltimes of body waves inside a sample with a given elasticity tensor is based on the Christoffel equation. The predicted polarizations on the surface then are obtained using the anisotropic Zoeppritz equations. The type of velocity measured (phase or group velocity) depends on the acquisition geometry and the material properties. This is taken into account in the inversion procedure.

However, as most of the proposed approaches are suitable for outdoor operation, only a few techniques have been designed for indoor environments, where the systems cannot rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and, therefore, have to use their exteroceptive sensors for navigation. In this paper, we present a general navigation system that enables a small-sized quadrotor system to autonomously operate in indoor environments. To achieve this, we systematically extend and adapt techniques that have been successfully applied on ground robots. We describe all algorithms and present a broad set of experiments, which illustrate that they enable a quadrotor robot to reliably and autonomously navigate in indoor environments.", "Embodied fitness assessment of robotic controllers is slow but grounded, while assessment in a simulated environment is fast but can run foul of the 'reality gap'.

Whilst this form of media access control brings several timeliness benefits, studies have also illustrated negative effects on transmission reliability. This paper extends the 'window transmission' technique which was recently proposed by the authors to help overcome this problem in TDMA-based networks to include the effects of correlated (burst) errors. This paper employs a simple Markov model to describe burst error behaviors in a CAN network, and the model is used to develop an algorithm for calculating TDMA slot sizes which aim to provide prespecified statistical guarantees of message delivery. Computational results are presented which indicate that the technique can reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for specified reliability levels by a significant factor when compared to the use of message duplicates. The paper is concluded with an empirical study which provides further supportive evidence for the described technique.", "Rapid prototyping techniques are widely used to fabricate well-defined three-dimensional structures of tissue homologs. The piston-assisted microsyringe (PAM2) is a rapid prototyping technology specifically developed for low-shear stress extrusion of viscous hydrogel solutions containing cells. In this article the working parameters of the system were established to guarantee the realization of spatially controlled hydrogel scaffolds. Moreover the shear stresses acting on the cell membrane during extrusion was investigated through a computational fluid-dynamic analysis. The computational models show that the shear stress on the cells is of the order of 100 Pa during the extrusion process. HepG2 cells encapsulated in alginate were then extruded into spatially organized hepatic lobule-like architectures and their viability and function were evaluated. The results show that the metabolic fingerprint of the cells is preserved with respect to controls and the cells are uniformly distributed through the gel scaffold.", "Passive acoustic monitoring allows the assessment of marine mammal occurrence and distribution at greater temporal and spatial scales than is now possible with traditional visual surveys. However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

Usually, web technologies have been introduced to complement the control systems with smart add-ons and user friendly services or, for instance, to safely allow access to the control system to users from remote sites. Despite this still narrow spectrum of employment, some software technologies developed for high-performance web services, although originally intended and optimized for these particular applications, deserve some features suggesting a deeper integration in a control system and, eventually, their use to develop some of the control system's core components. In this paper, we present the conceptual design of a new control system for a particle accelerator and associated machine data acquisition system, based on a synergic combination of a nonrelational key/value database and network distributed object caching. The use of these technologies, to implement respectively continuous data archiving and data distribution between components, brought about the definition of a new control system concept offering a number of interesting features such as a high level of abstraction of services and components and their integration in a framework that can be seen as a comprehensive service provider that both graphical user interface applications and front-end controllers join for accessing and, to some extent, expanding its functionalities.", "In recent years the sport of climbing has seen consistent increase in popularity. Climbing requires a complex skill set for successful and safe exercising. While elite climbers receive intensive expert coaching to refine this skill set, this progression approach is not viable for the amateur population. We have developed ClimbAX - a climbing performance analysis system that aims for replicating expert assessments and thus represents a first step towards an automatic coaching system for climbing enthusiasts. Through an accelerometer based wearable sensing platform, climber's movements are captured. An automatic analysis procedure detects climbing sessions and moves, which form the basis for subsequent performance assessment. The assessment parameters are derived from sports science literature and include: power, control, stability, speed. ClimbAX was evaluated in a large case study with 53 climbers under competition settings. We report a strong correlation between predicted scores and official competition results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our automatic skill assessment system.", null, "Smart wireless sensors have been recognized as a promising technology to overcome many inherent difficulties and limitations associated with traditional wired structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a set of numerical studies and experimental validations on an in-house cable-stayed bridge model in terms of the accuracy of identified dynamic properties.", "Haptic paddles-low-cost one-degree-of-freedom force feedback devices-have been used with great success at several universities throughout the US to teach the basic concepts of dynamic systems and physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) to students. The ETHZ haptic paddle was developed for a new pHRI course offered in the undergraduate Mechatronics Focus track of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Twenty students engaged in this 2-h weekly lecture over the 14 weeks of the Autumn 2011 semester, complemented by a weekly 2-h laboratory session with the ETHZ haptic paddle. In pairs, students worked through three common sets of experiments before embarking on a specialization project that investigated one of several advanced topics such as impedance control with force feedback, admittance control, the effect of velocity estimation on stability, or electromyographic control. For these projects, students received additional hardware, including force sensors, electrooptical encoders or high-performance data acquisition cards. The learning objectives were developed in the context of an accompanying faculty development program at ETH Zurich; a set of interactive sequences and the oral exam were explicitly aligned to these learning objectives. The outcomes of the specialization project presentations and oral exams, and a student evaluation of the course, demonstrated that the ETHZ haptic paddle is a valuable tool that allows students to quite literally grasp abstract principles such as mechanical impedance, passivity, and human factors and helps students create a tangible link between theory and practice in the highly interdisciplinary field of pHRI.", "Most approaches to recognize human activities rely on pattern recognition techniques that are trained once at design time, and then remain unchanged during usage. This reflects the assumption that the mapping between sensor signal patterns and activity classes is known at design-time. This cannot be guaranteed in mobile and pervasive computing, where unpredictable changes can often occur in open-ended environments. Run-time adaptation can address these issues. We introduce and formalize a data processing architecture extending current approaches that allows for a wide range of realizations of adaptive activity recognition systems. The adaptive activity recognition chain (adARC) includes self-monitoring, adaptation strategies and external feedback as components of the now closed-loop recognition system. We show an adARC capable of unsupervised self-adaptation to run-time changing class distributions. It improves activity recognition accuracy when sensors suffer from on-body displacement. We show an adARC capable of adaptation to changing sensor setups. It allows for scalability by enabling a recognition systems to autonomously exploit newly introduced sensors. We discuss other adaptive recognition systems within the adARC architecture. The results outline that this architecture frames a useful solution space for the real-world deployment of adaptive activity recognition systems. It allows to present and compare recognition systems in a coherent and modular manner. We discuss the challenges and new research directions resulting from this new perspective on adaptive activity recognition.", "The interdisciplinary nature of robotics allows mobile robots to be used successfully in a broad range of courses at the postgraduate level and in Ph.D. research. Practical industrial-like mobile robotic demonstrations encourage students and increase their motivation by providing them with learning benefits not achieved with traditional educational robotic platforms.

Besides learning engineering concepts, in performing industrial-like exercises, students develop valuable skills such as teamwork and the capacity to solve problems similar to those they may encounter in a real industrial environment. The developed infrastructure represents a valuable platform for robotic education that can be used in many different disciplines as a way to demonstrate how to cope with the difficulties and challenges related to the development of industrial infrastructure systems. The platform evaluation proved its ability to inculcate the expected engineering skills.

Typical requirements of ordinary things, such as low power consumption, small size, and low cost, demand innovative solutions.

The infrastructure was built around EPOS' second generation of motes, which features an ARM processor and an IEEE 802.15.4 radio transceiver. It is presented to end users through a trustful communication protocol stack compatible with TCP/IP. Trustfulness was tackled at MAC level by extending C-MAC, EPOS native MAC protocol, with AES capabilities that were used to encrypt and authenticate IP datagrams packets. Our authentication mechanism encompasses temporal information to protect the network against replay attacks.

This frequently results in the students early disengagement from the subject of their degrees which in turn can lead to excessive wastage, that is, reduced retention. In this paper, we report on our academic groups attempts within creative computing degrees at a UK university to counter these problems through the introduction of a 6 week long project that newly enrolled students embark on at the very beginning of their studies. This group project, involving the creation of a 3D etch-a-sketch-like computer graphics application with a hardware interface, provides a breadth-first, activity-led introduction to the students chosen academic discipline, aiming to increase student engagement while providing a stimulating learning experience with the overall goal to increase retention. We present the methods and results of two iterations of these projects in the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 academic years, and conclude that the approach worked well for these cohorts, with students expressing increased interest in their chosen discipline, in addition to noticeable improvements in retention following the first year of the students studies.", "Structured ASIC technology improves manufacturing yield and reduces manufacturing turnaround time with a low NRE cost.

Analytical approaches capable of capturing the properties of such networks can therefore enhance our ability to make inferences from functional MRI, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the formal modelling of networks and offers a wide range of theoretical tools to quantify specific features of network architecture (topology) that can provide information complementing the anatomical localization of areas responding to given stimuli or tasks (topography). Explicit modelling of the architecture of axonal connections and interactions among areas can furthermore reveal peculiar topological properties that are conserved across diverse biological networks, and highly sensitive to disease states. The field is evolving rapidly, partly fuelled by computational developments that enable the study of connectivity at fine anatomical detail and the simultaneous interactions among multiple regions. Recent publications in this area have shown that graph-based modelling can enhance our ability to draw causal inferences from functional MRI experiments, and support the early detection of disconnection and the modelling of pathology spread in neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, neurophysiological studies have shown that network topology has a profound link to epileptogenesis and that connectivity indices derived from graph models aid in modelling the onset and spread of seizures. Graph-based analyses may therefore significantly help understand the bases of a range of neurological conditions.

Sizing the internal architecture to sustain the peak load may lead to power inefficiency at low loads. This paper presents a power saving scheme to improve the power efficiency of the MSSR by dynamically adapting the size of its internal architecture to the offered load to reduce power needs. The off-line problem is defined as a mixed integer linear programming optimization model, shown to be NP-hard. We propose a differential on-line heuristic to solve the optimization problem when the traffic load changes. The heuristic avoids the complete MSSR reconfiguration of the optimal off-line solution that may lead to forwarding delay increase or service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed on-line algorithm, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserves the load proportional power demand characteristics of the optimal off-line solution.", "The paper introduces a new system for vibration acquisition and analysis for rotating machinery - VIBSYS.

The extension may be used to transform what is traditionally a swarm robotics platform into a self-reconfigurable modular robotic system. We introduce a modified version of a previously developed collective locomotion algorithm and present new experimental results across three different themes. We begin by investigating how the performance of the collective locomotion algorithm is affected by the size and shape of the robotic structures involved, examining structures containing up to nine modules. Without alteration to the underlying algorithm, we then analyse the implicit self-assembling and self-reconfiguring capabilities of the system and show that the novel use of 'virtual sensors' can significantly improve performance. Finally, by examining a form of environment driven self-reconfiguration, we observe the behaviour of the system in a more complex environment. We conclude that the modular e-puck extension represents a viable platform for investigating collective locomotion, self-assembly and self-reconfiguration.", "To simulate the cardiac niche, a bioreactor system was designed and constructed to incorporate cyclic stretch, rhythmic electrical stimulation, and constant perfusion.

Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration. Field stimulation delivered through this system could induce rhythmic contractions in adult rat ventricular myocytes, with contractile characteristics similar to those paced in a standard field stimulation chamber.

The concept collective action framing' is borrowed from social movement theory to describe how hackers have appropriated notions of a post-industrial, information society in their struggles against intellectual property laws and state censorship. Hackers have reintroduced an element of conflict and antagonism into otherwise politically innocuous visions of post-industrialism. This residual of antagonism can be traced back to the roots of the post-industrial myth in Marxist, historical materialist theory. By exploring these origins, the article proceeds to compare the hopes invested by hackers in the emancipatory force of information technology with the earlier beliefs of labour movements that the forces of history were on their side. Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.", null, "Flying Head is a telepresence system that remotely connects humans and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Most of the research on open software routers (OSRs) have focused on improving the performance of single PCs with a few proposals for a distributed design. Modern routers are equipped with enhanced functionality such as QoS features in addition to packet forwarding. However, providing enhanced functionality in distributed OSR architectures has largely remained unaddressed. A distributed design introduces challenges in its implementation due to looser coupling between different subsystems.", "WFQ is a widely used scheduler that enables QoS features in a router. The inherent centralized nature of the design of WFQ schedulers in most switches and routers creates several challenges when exported to distributed architectures.

It focuses on the Indonesian new media art community, The House of Natural Fiber (HONF), as a historically and socially specific interpretation of four key avant-garde principles: to break with the autonomy of art, engage with the praxis of life, provide utopian visions, and present aesthetic innovation. The HONF art projects explore the interaction between life, art, science and technology in both practical and aesthetic ways. They not only reflect on the tremendous impact of communication media and other technology on social and natural environments in Indonesia and worldwide, but they also provide scenarios for alternative ways of dealing with these environments. Aesthetically, they are innovative in their exploration of the field of presentation rather than representation.", "A cognitive mobile robot must be able to autonomously solve the three complex problems of navigating: where it is, where it is going and how it is going to get there. The first is addressed by techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The next stage of navigating is to plan a path to a goal, which is often achieved by learning techniques due to the scale of search required. Commonly, the localisation and mapping stage is separated from path planning stage, with the function not of interest being considered ideal in order to simplify the problem (similarly, the goal is often predetermined by an external agent, such as a human operator specifying a location to reach). This work integrates the planning with the localisation and mapping in order to investigate the benefits of considering these aspects together (rather than as a separate functions as is often assumed). Firstly, experiments on real-robots show decreased localisation error in this approach (1.8 mm +/- 0.41 mm to 1.2 mm +/- 0.26 mm). Secondly, the number of steps to goal has concurrently been reduced (13.4 steps to 11.8 steps). This work is novel in the integration of evolutionary computation planning techniques with SLAM. It also has enabled the opportunity for rule-sharing between heterogeneous robots and the inclusion of action policies in SLAM filter updates.", "A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-domain channel measurement methodology is presented. This methodology can be implemented in any transmit/receive hardware consisting of radio frequency modules and baseband digital processing units. It involves the transmission and reception of frequency and phase-optimized complex exponentials through antenna arrays, followed by an offline frequency estimation, which makes additional synchronization circuitry unnecesary. To test the feasibility of this method, a series of measurements is presented, employing a 4 x 4 dual-band (2.4/5 GHz) MIMO test bed.", "For the purpose of autonomous UAV flight control, cameras are ubiquitously exploited as a cheap and effective onboard sensor for obtaining non-metric position or velocity measurements. Since the metric scale cannot be directly recovered from visual input only, several methods have been proposed in the recent literature to overcome this limitation by exploiting independent 'metric' information from additional onboard sensors. The flexibility of most approaches is, however, often limited by the need of constantly tracking over time a certain set of features in the environment, thus potentially suffering from possible occlusions or loss of tracking during flight. In this respect, in this paper we address the problem of estimating the scale of the observed linear velocity in the UAV body frame from direct measurement of the instantaneous (and non-metric) optical flow, and the integration of an onboard Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for providing (metric) acceleration readings. To this end, two different estimation techniques are developed and critically compared: a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a novel nonlinear observer stemming from the adaptive control literature. Results based on simulated and real data recorded during a quadrotor UAV flight demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "Many assistive tasks involve manipulation near the care-receiver's body, including self-care tasks such as dressing, feeding, and personal hygiene. A robot can provide assistance with these tasks by moving its end effector to poses near the care-receiver's body. However, perceiving and maneuvering around the care-receiver's body can be challenging due to a variety of issues, including convoluted geometry, compliant materials, body motion, hidden surfaces, and the object upon which the body is resting (e.g., a wheelchair or bed). Using geometric simulations, we first show that an assistive robot can achieve a much larger percentage of end-effector poses near the care-receiver's body if its arm is allowed to make contact. Second, we present a novel system with a custom controller and whole-arm tactile sensor array that enables a Willow Garage PR2 to regulate contact forces across its entire arm while moving its end effector to a commanded pose. We then describe tests with two people with motor impairments, one of whom used the system to grasp and pull a blanket over himself and to grab a cloth and wipe his face, all while in bed at his home. Finally, we describe a study with eight able-bodied users in which they used the system to place objects near their bodies. On average, users perceived the system to be safe and comfortable, even though substantial contact occurred between the robot's arm and the user's body.", "Estimating the input-output behavior of low voltage powerline channels for indoor high speed data communications requires the availability of proper wideband channel sounding tools. In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces. Some of its specific applications, namely the estimation of the time-varying transfer function of an indoor powerline channel and the evaluation of the power spectral density of the noise affecting it, are illustrated to show the potentialities of the developed equipment.", "This chapter provides an experience-based framework of prototypes development and commissioning.

In contrast to most commercial rapid prototyping processes, the parallelism afforded by microrobot teams allows incremental inspection of structures during assembly. In the present case, this approach is applied to parts fabricated from carbon fiber struts bonded with UV-cured epoxy. Preliminary tests involving thermal and vibrational inspection methods are described and compared with the results of FEA models of the joints. Vibrational inspection performed by microrobots and recorded using a directional microphone, characterizes bond joint natural frequency with good resolution (an average measurement standard deviation of 5Hz over a range of 650-1215 Hz). These effective stiffness measurements are correlated with ultimate bond strength as well. The measurements are sufficient to distinguish between joints that do or do not have desired amounts of adhesive.", "This paper presents a real-time monocular vision solution for MAVs to autonomously search for and land on an arbitrary landing site. The autonomous MAV is provided with only one single reference image of the landing site with an unknown size before initiating this task.

A multi-scale ORB feature based method is implemented and integrated into the SLAM framework for landing site detection. We use a RANSAC-based method to locate the landing site within the map of the SLAM system, taking advantage of those map points associated with the detected landing site.

Analyzing this fast growing, large data set requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently most meteor echo routines search for underdense meteor trails, often discarding overdense and nonspecular meteor trails. This is because their main purpose is the study of mesospheric winds. But the study of meteor flux requires the unique identification of each type of meteor reflections. In this paper, a multilayer radar detection and classification algorithm is proposed to correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector. In this step, we start by selecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in order to detect all types of radar echoes; however, a high probability offalse alarm is often produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data collected from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas, Puerto Rico, on April 5, 1998. A total of 270 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, nonspecular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 50% of the labeled echoes as training samples and divided the rest 50% testing samples as 10 subsets for testing. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples. Details concerning implementation, feature extraction, and data visualization are presented and discussed.", "Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks.

Several commercial and open-source solutions are available, based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software.

Physical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and energy.

Most notably, the Army's communications systems are neither developed nor integrated in tandem with their EW system counterparts, even though both have many common components with similar functionality. In addition, because all of these C4ISR and EW systems compete for extremely limited Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum and Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) resources, they are prohibitively costly to integrate and procure, and their performance suffers from many conflicting requirements. The resultant multitude of systems and system configurations dramatically increases the logistical burden on our Combat Brigades that need to sustain, transport, and upgrade these capabilities.

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.

However, assessment of EMG PR control for daily prosthesis use is still limited. One of the major barriers is the lack of a portable and configurable embedded system to implement the EMG PR control. This paper aimed to design an open and configurable embedded system for EMG PR implementation so that researchers can easily modify and optimize the control algorithms upon our designed platform and test the EMG PR control outside of the lab environments. The open platform was built on an open source embedded Linux Operating System running a high-performance Gumstix board. Both the hardware and software system framework were openly designed.

Such flexibility enabled easy integration of our embedded system with different types of commercialized or prototypic artificial arms. Thus far, our system was portable for take-home use. Additionally, compared with previously reported embedded systems for EMG PR implementation, our system demonstrated improved processing efficiency and high system precision.

Scientist believes that the main cause of this is because of the deforestation, pollution, carbon emission from transportation and factories that led to this global warming. However, there are also skeptics that believe otherwise. To prove the cause of global warming and whether it is an event that occurs every now and then as some skeptics and scientists suggested a multi sensor device is build, which consist of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and oxygen.

At the same time, firms need to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture value from their product and/or service system. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized, matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey data (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases community members' involvement in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal value capture is softer than hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.", "Despite being around for almost two decades, foot-mounted inertial navigation only has gotten a limited spread. Contributing factors to this are lack of suitable hardware platforms and difficult system integration. As a solution to this, we present an open-source wireless foot-mounted inertial navigation module with an intuitive and significantly simplified dead reckoning interface. The interface is motivated from statistical properties of the underlying aided inertial navigation and argued to give negligible information loss. The module consists of both a hardware platform and embedded software. Details of the platform and the software are described, and a summarizing description of how to reproduce the module are given. System integration of the module is outlined and finally, we provide a basic performance assessment of the module. In summary, the module provides a modularization of the foot-mounted inertial navigation and makes the technology significantly easier to use.", "Non-intrusive load monitoring of domestic appliances has received steady interest in the last twenty years, first because of interest from energy companies interested in usage statistics for power balancing and, more recently, in order to assist users in tuning their habits for reduced power consumption.

The performance of UAV-system components such as inertial navigation sensors, propulsion, control processors and algorithms are gradually improving. Simultaneously, lidar technologies are continuously developing in terms of reliability, accuracy, as well as speed of data collection, storage and processing. The lidar development towards miniature systems with high data rates has, together with recent UAV development, a great potential for new three dimensional (3D) mapping capabilities. Compared to lidar mapping from manned full-size aircraft a small unmanned aircraft can be cost efficient over small areas and more flexible for deployment. An advantage with high resolution lidar compared to 3D mapping from passive (multi angle) photogrammetry is the ability to penetrate through vegetation and detect partially obscured targets. Another advantage is the ability to obtain 3D data over the whole survey area, without the limited performance of passive photogrammetry in low contrast areas. The purpose of our work is to demonstrate 3D lidar mapping capability from a small multirotor UAV. We present the first experimental results and the mechanical and electrical integration of the Velodyne HDL-32E lidar on a six-rotor aircraft with a total weight of 7 kg. The rotating lidar is mounted at an angle of 20 degrees from the horizontal plane giving a vertical field-of-view of 10-50 degrees below the horizon in the aircraft forward directions. For absolute positioning of the 3D data, accurate positioning and orientation of the lidar sensor is of high importance. We evaluate the lidar data position accuracy both based on inertial navigation system (INS) data, and on INS data combined with lidar data. The INS sensors consist of accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, magnetometers, and a pressure sensor for altimetry. The lidar range resolution and accuracy is documented as well as the capability for target surface reflectivity estimation based on measurements on calibration standards. Initial results of the general mapping capability including the detection through partly obscured environments is demonstrated through field data collection and analysis.", "The effective management of several distributed devices, even in real time, is one of the mandatory conditions for the design, operation and upgrade of modern particle accelerators control systems.

This printer allows the substantial advantages of additive manufacturing techniques (including rapid turnaround prototyping of physical objects and support for high levels of customization and configuration) to be employed with a new class of material. This material is a form of loose felt formed when fibers from an incoming feed of yarn are entangled with the fibers in layers below it.

While transmission energy can be controlled at each node, reception energy is outside the control of the nodes because they usually do not know the arrival time of their packets and they cannot avoid overhearing packets directed to the other nodes in range. Energy-aware MAC protocols apply duty-cycling which keeps the radio module off for most of the time and wakes it up periodically, but they suffer from overhearing which has been addressed so far either by means of preambles or by means of separate wake-up channels.

This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a PCIe-based rack area network system called Marlin, which is designed to support the communications and resource sharing needs of disaggregated racks. By virtue of being based on PCIe, Marlin presents a memory-based addressing model for both I/O device sharing among multiple hosts and inter-host communications. That is, when a node communicates with other nodes or accesses resources in the same rack, it uses memory read and write operations. In the area of inter-node communications, Marlin offers hardware-based remote direct memory access (HRDMA) as a first-class communications primitive between servers within a rack. In addition, Marlin supports socket-based communications for legacy network applications and cross-machine zero memory copying for applications designed specifically to take full advantage of memory-based communications.

To reduce the complexity, a method for controlling packet processing in NPs by using PPCs is proposed. By means of this method, complex control messages are partially processed and divided into simplified control packets by a CPU outside the NP chip, and these packets are sent to a control-processing PPC. The control-processing PPC controls data-processing PPCs by using data-exchange mechanisms, such as a shared memory or an on-chip network, which are more uniform and simpler than those between a CPC and PPCs. This control method is applied to a virtual-link control-processing task and packet-processing tasks in a network node with a virtualization function. Both tasks are described by a hardware-independent high-level language called \"Phonepl,\" and communication between the PPCs is programmed following normal and uniform shared-memory semantics.

We present a proof-of-concept system that has enabled a person with severe quadriplegia named Henry Evans to shave himself in his own home using a general purpose mobile manipulator (PR2 from Willow Garage). The robot primarily provides assistance by holding a tool (e.g., an electric shaver) at user-specified locations around the user's head, while he/she moves his/her head against it. If the robot detects forces inappropriate for the task (e.g., shaving), it withdraws the tool. The robot also holds a mirror with its other arm, so that the user can see what he/she is doing. For all aspects of the task, the robot and the human work together. The robot uses a series of distinct semi-autonomous subsystems during the task to navigate to poses next to the wheelchair, attain initial arm configurations, register a 3D model of the person's head, move the tool to coarse semantically-labeled tool poses (e.g, \"Cheek\"), and finely position the tool via incremental movements. Notably, while moving the tool near the user's head, the robot uses an ellipsoidal coordinate system attached to the 3D head model. In addition to describing the complete robotic system, we report results from Henry Evans using it to shave both sides of his face while sitting in his wheelchair at home. He found the process to be long (54 minutes) and the interface unintuitive. Yet, he also found the system to be comfortable to use, felt safe while using it, was satisfied with it, and preferred it to a human caregiver.", "A control strategy for fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is proposed and relies on the combination of linear model predictive control laws for the attitude dynamics of the system, along with an implementation of the L-1-navigation logic that provides attitude reference commands to achieve precise path tracking. The employed predictive controllers ensure the performance characteristics of the critical attitude loops, while respecting the actuation limitations of the platform along with safety considerations encoded as state constraints. Being explicitly computed, these strategies are computationally lightweight and allow for seamless integration on the onboard avionics. Once the desired attitude response characteristics are achieved, tuning the cascaded nonlinear L-1-navigation law becomes straightforward as lateral acceleration references can be precisely tracked. A wide set of experiments was conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies. As shown high quality tracking results are achieved.", "Modeling the structure and evolution of products is important from the standpoint of improving quality and maintainability. With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve-addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.", "Hard disks are one of the largest sources of power consumption in large-scale storage systems. The disk spin up/down technique has been shown to be an effective solution to this problem. Accordingly, the Open Compute Project (OCP) proposed a storage server for cold data, known as Cold Storage, to reduce power consumption using the spin-down technique in large-scale storage systems. With the aim of making effective use of Cold Storage, we characterize the power consumed by a hard disk in its various modes of operation. We then analyze the workload of an instant messaging service. These our contributions should provide guidelines for the implementation of a stable and energy-efficient distributed file system on a Cold Storage server, and to establish a spin-down policy that is power-proportional and promotes reliability.", "This paper provides an approach to evaluating Quality of Context (QoC) parameters in a ubiquitous Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environment. Lack of quality can lead assisted systems to respond inappropriately, resulting in errors related to assistance or support, or putting the user at risk. QoC assessments can improve these systems and set them to perform specific actions whenever lapses in quality occur. Initially, the study presents a literature review of QoC, then it introduces the context management architecture used. The proposal is verified with the Siafu simulator in an AAL scenario where the user's health is monitored with information about blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Considering some parameters, the proposed QoC assessment allows verifying the extent to which the context information is up-to-date, valid, accurate, complete and significant. The implementation of this proposal might mean a big social impact and a technological innovation applied to AAL, at the disposal and support of a significant number of individuals such as elderly or sick people, and with a more precise technology.", "The MoMiReS is a mobile mixed reality system aimed at physical and occupational therapies. The goal of the system is to engage therapy patients by involving them in a fun to play 3D game environment through physical interactions with a wireless sensor glove. Our system offers a solution for rehabilitation of the hand, wrist originated problems with a smartphone based mobile mixed reality game that will be used in conjunction with traditional rehabilitation programs such as home treatment. The key factor in the success of the home treatment is compliance of patients to the given therapy instructions. However, therapists report that patients do not carry on their home-exercises and activities. The main reason is the lack of motivation and boredom for the given activities. These activities require patients to carry out set of repetitive movements. The lack of motivation in exercises causes discontinuity and increases the recovery time and eventually increases the cost of the treatment. Therefore, we propose a complete framework by reducing the drawbacks of the traditional therapy. Our framework has three components; hardware, smartphone game, and cloud for data storage and processing. A sensor glove was developed with plug and play motion sensors streamed in real-time to the mobile phone with Bluetooth connection. The glove is used for tracking finger pressures and motion of the fingers. The patient side smartphone based interactive game verifies compliance of the motions for assigned exercises by occupational/physical therapist. The cloud side aims at ensuring patients that the assigned exercises are carried out and also monitors patient in real-time. Cloud application keeps the record of the patients' progresses for further analysis by therapists. In order to understand the effectiveness of the proposed system, we developed games specifically for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. The usability and effectiveness of the systems are surveyed among the occupational therapy students. Survey results show that 92% approval rate of the system.", "The Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA) is currently designing an unmanned aerial research system that is lightweight and has high-structural flexibility, code named the High Altitude Performance Demonstrator (HAPD).The project is framed within the Italian Aerospace Research Program, under the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Chapter. This unmanned aerial system is mainly aimed at developing and validating advanced modeling methodologies for flexible aircrafts. A compendium of the system is provided in this paper, together with a deeper discussion of how CIRA developed the structural and aeroelastic design of HAPD. Some experimental tests performed to validate the main concepts are also presented. The vehicle has an unconventional joined-wing configuration that mitigates undesired extreme flexibility, but that results in a more complicated design. First, aeroelasticity has been taken into account from the preliminary stages of design because flexibility significantly affects aircraft behavior. Second, the HAPD structure is redundant with regard to constraints (because of its joined wing), thus making the internal forces dependent on the stiffness distribution. For these reasons, the availability of an integrated methodology that can support the structural design is mandatory. The output of such a methodology consists of primary structure stiffness distributions (fuselage, wings, and vertical tail), compatibly with the absence of any aeroelastic instability, and structural failure under operative loads.", "In order to construct a green-light-regulated gene expression system for cyanobacteria, we characterized a green-light sensing system derived from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, consisting of the green-light sensing histidine kinase CcaS, the cognate response regulator CcaR, and the promoter of cpcG2 (P-cpcG2). CcaS and CcaR act as a genetic controller and activate gene expression from P-cpcG2 with green-light illumination. The green-light induction level of the native P-cpcG2 was investigated using GFPuv as a reporter gene inserted in a broad-host-range vector. A clear induction of protein expression from native P-cpcG2 under green-light illumination was observed; however, the expression level was very low compared with P-trc, which was reported to act as a constitutive promoter in cyanobacteria. Therefore, a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence derived from the cpcB gene was inserted in the 5 untranslated region of the cpcG2 gene, and the expression level of CcaR was increased. Thus, constructed engineered green-light sensing system resulted in about 40-fold higher protein expression than with the wild-type promoter with a high ON/OFF ratio under green-light illumination. The engineered green-light gene expression system would be a useful genetic tool for controlling gene expression in the emergent cyanobacterial bioprocesses.", "This paper considers problem of localization for an aerial robot in unstructured indoor environments. A vision correction method based on linear characteristics is proposed. The dynamic model is established using an optical flow sensor. Use a strap-down camera to capture the frame of perpendicular line on the ground, and calculate the global position of their intersection point. As an observation, the vision position is input to the KALMAN filter in order to eliminate the accumulated error. Experimental results from indoor hover test verified the accuracy and real-time of the approach.", "This article presents a method for long-term autonomous micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) localization and position stabilization. The proposed method extends MAV proprietary stabilization based on inertial sensor or optical flow processing, without use of an external positioning system. The method extracts visual features from the images captured by a down-looking camera mounted under the MAV and matching these to previously observed features. Due to its precision and reliability, the method is well suited for stabilization of MAVs acting in closely cooperating compact teams with small mutual distances between team members. Performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments on a quad-copter equipped with all necessary sensors and computers for the autonomous operation.", null, "This work describes an ultrasonic inspection procedure designed for verifying coarse-grained structure materials, which are commonly used on nuclear reactors. In this case, conventional phased array techniques cannot be used due to attenuating characteristics and backscattered noise from microstructures inside the material. Thus, synthetic aperture ultrasonic imaging (SAFT) is used for this approach in contact conditions. In order to increase energy transferred to the medium, synthetic transmit aperture is formed by several elements which generate a diverging wavefront equivalent to a virtual ultrasound source behind the transducer. On the other hand, the phase coherence technique has been applied to reduce more structural noise and improve the image quality. The beamforming process has been implemented over a GPU platform to reduce computing time.", ["The 3D printing technology allows the low-cost creation of structures based on user-defined configuration parameters. Unlike other plastic-forming technologies, there is no tooling cost related to the creation of a mold. Because of this, highly-customized structures can be created with a minimum production quantity of one, allowing adaptation to individual mission needs (for a single-HAB mission) or the change of the structure across a multi-unit run (e.g., to test various configurations or as part of a study requiring multiple payloads with different configurations).", "This paper considers the mission possibilities enabled by the use of 3D printing for HAB structures. These mission types include low-cost student-centric missions, atmospheric and other science missions and engineering development and testing missions. It presents two case studies to illustrate this point: the first is a low-cost approach to flying multiple small student payloads as part of a larger structure. The second is an engineering testing mission for a small spacecraft. The benefits of using this approach (as opposed to other techniques like foam-forming or the creation of custom metal structures) are considered. The paper also considers the proposed approach's legal and technical viability. The requirements imposed by the federal aviation regulations on HAB missions are assessed. Also assessed are the environmental conditions experienced at typical HAB altitudes of 100,000 feet or higher on the 3D printed structures. Approaches for mitigating these effects are presented and discussed. The paper concludes with 3D discussion of the possibilities for future missions enabled by printed HAB payloads."], "This research analyzes the affiliated multipartite social networks of hackathon style mass collaboration events. Using social network analysis we model the innovation networks for NASA's International Space Apps Challenge and use social network analysis to understand the structure of and relationships within the modeled networks. Using metrics such as degree, degree distribution, degree correlations, and density, the resulting models and study answer questions like: can social network statistics act as indicators of innovation performance within a network and which statistics provide insight to the likelihood of innovation performance? We address these research questions by building the affiliation networks for the 2012 and 2013 NASA International Space Apps Challenges and applying Gnyawali and Srivastava's conceptual model on cluster and network effects against these real-world networks to empirically prove the likelihood of innovation.

Through the NRS 034 domestic load research programme a large number of load profiles of residential consumers from various Living Standards Measure (ie LSM) classes were collected. The load profiles are further described by a set of socio demographic indicators which is obtained through a front-door survey. A model that relates the hourly customer load profiles to household income, time electrified and region was developed and the output may be used in various planning activities, e.g. electrification design, network expansion planning, long term load forecasting etc. This analysis covers all data collected to end of 2011. A software implementation of the model is available which allows the user to obtain estimates of hourly profiles for different months given a set of input parameters.", "This paper presents a novel approach to the run-time detection of faults in autonomous mobile robots, based on simulated predictions of real robot behaviour. We show that although simulation can be used to predict real robot behaviour, drift between simulation and reality occurs over time due to the reality gap. This necessitates periodic reinitialisation of the simulation to reduce false positives. Using a simple obstacle avoidance controller afflicted with partial motor failure, we show that selecting the length of this reinitialisation time period is non-trivial, and that there exists a trade-off between minimising drift and the ability to detect the presence of faults.", "Geosensor networks and sensor webs are two technologies widely used for determining our exposure to pollution levels and ensuring that this information is publicly available. However, most of these networks are independent from each other and often designed for specific domains, hindering the integration of sensor data from different sources. We contributed to the integration of several environmental sensor networks in the context of the IDEA project. The objective of this project was to measure noise and air quality pollution levels in urban areas in Belgium using low-cost sensors. This paper presents the IDEA Environmental Measurement Cloud as a proof-of-conceptData-as-a-Service (DaaS) cloud platform that integrates environmental sensor networks with a sensor web. Our DaaS platform implements a federated two-layer architecture to loosely couple together sensor networks deployed over a wide geographical area with web services. It offers several data access, discovery, and visualization services to the public while serving as a scientific tool for noise pollution research. After one year of operation, it hosts approximately 6.5 TB of environmental data and offers to the public near real-time noise pollution measurements from over 40 locations in Belgium.", ["There exists an increasing demand to incorporate mobile interactive robots to assist humans in repetitive, non-value added tasks in the manufacturing domain. Our aim is to develop a mobile robotic assistant for fetch-and-deliver tasks in human-oriented assembly line environments. Assembly lines present a niche yet novel challenge for mobile robots; the robot must precisely control its position on a surface which may be either stationary, moving, or split (e. g. in the case that the robot straddles the moving assembly line and remains partially on the stationary surface).", "In this paper we present a control and sensing solution for a mobile robotic assistant as it traverses a moving-floor assembly line. Solutions readily exist for control of wheeled mobile robots on static surfaces; we build on the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) software architecture and generalize the algorithms for the moving line environment. Off-the-shelf sensors and localization algorithms are explored to sense the moving surface, and a customized solution is presented using PX4Flow optic flow sensors and a laser scanner-based localization algorithm. Validation of the control and sensing system is carried out both in simulation and in hardware experiments on a customized treadmill. Initial demonstrations of the hardware system yield promising results; the robot successfully maintains its position while on, and while straddling, the moving line."], "Supporting the concurrent execution of multiple tasks on lightweight sensor nodes could enable the deployment of independent applications on a shared wireless sensor network, thus saving cost and time by exploiting infrastructures which are typically underutilized if dedicated to a single task. Existing approaches to wireless sensor network programming provide limited support to concurrency at the cost of reducing the generality and the expressiveness of the language adopted. This paper presents a java-compatible platform for wireless sensor networks which provides a thorough support to preemptive multitasking while allowing the programmers to write their applications in java. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested on top of VirtualSense, an ultra-low-power wireless sensor mote providing a java-compatible runtime environment. Performance and scalability of the solution are discussed in light of extensive experiments performed on representative benchmarks.", "Emerging mega-trends (e.g., mobile, social, cloud, and big data) in information and communication technologies (ICT) are commanding new challenges to future Internet, for which ubiquitous accessibility, high bandwidth, and dynamic management are crucial. However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.", "In acceleration and vibration environment, to weaken frequency instability influence of the crystal oscillator on GPS carrier loop and rectify frequency compensation, researchers usually adopt the solution of crystal oscillator frequency acceleration compensation. The vital basis of compensating frequency errors is how to obtain accurately corresponding sensitive parameters of crystal oscillator. In the traditional calibration approach of acceleration sensitivity coefficient, indispensably using precise frequency reference and measurement equipment makes the calibration process expensive and complex, that fails to be widely applied in GPS navigation system. Combined a precise frequency reference of GPS satellites with the carrier tracking loop principle, the paper analyzes the acceleration frequency errors transmission mechanism of crystal oscillator in the carrier tracking loop, and designs an adaptive weighted EKF to handle frequency bias observed values synchronously in multiple tracking loops, which reduces frequency bias estimating noise and separates frequency offset and frequency drift rate, from the receiver's frequency bias observation in the crystal oscillator. And on this basis, acceleration sensitivity coefficients of crystal oscillator calibrate on the super tight combination navigation board by 2g flipping calibration method. The experiments show that the method is able to effectively calibrate acceleration sensitivity coefficients of crystal oscillator, which is the solution base of compensating crystal oscillator acceleration frequency errors on related GPS technology research.", "The timescales of biological processes, primarily those inherent to the molecular mechanisms of disease, are long (> mu s) and involve complex interactions of systems consisting of many atoms (>10(6)). Simulating these systems requires an advanced computational approach, and as such, coarse-grained (CG) models have been developed and highly optimised for accelerator hardware, primarily graphics processing units (GPUs). In this review, I discuss the implementation of CG models for biologically relevant systems, and show how such models can be optimised and perform well on GPU-accelerated hardware. Several examples of GPU implementations of CG models for both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations on purely GPU and hybrid CPU/GPU architectures are presented. Both the hardware and algorithmic limitations of various models, which depend greatly on the application of interest, are discussed.", "The use of haptics in virtual reality and video games has received growing attention as a means of enhancing the sensation of immersion in these environments. The sensation of touching virtual objects not only augments the impression of reality but also can improve the performance. However, the design of haptic interactions is not an easy task, and it usually needs a great effort due to the absence of powerful prototyping toolkits. Thus, this article proposes a vibrotactile prototyping toolkit for Eccentric Rotating Mass actuators named VITAKI. The main objective of this platform is to facilitate the prototyping and testing procedures of new vibrotactile interaction techniques for Virtual Reality and video games. A detailed description of the design of the system is provided, presenting the hardware and software elements that make up the VITAKI toolkit. In addition, its application to two different examples to illustrate its use is provided. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of this toolkit is presented. This evaluation is divided into two main stages. On one hand, a study of Olsen's criteria is performed to analyze its general capabilities. On the other hand, a comparison with previously presented proposals is included too. These two analyses, together with other experiments where the devices created with the toolkit were tested by end users, highlight its main features and its advantages over other proposals.", "Valuable information from acoustic signals has not been fully considered into real applications associated with assisting people. In fact, the assessment of acoustic signals as an input parameter for localization techniques has useful applications in detecting the presence of living beings trapped in emergency situations by processing any type of sound emitted in face of danger. Indeed, acoustic signals have several technical considerations that make them very attractive, mainly because of their simple acquisition and processing. Thus, this paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a prototype that localizes a sound source through the processing of acoustic signal measurements. Concerning the acoustic event localization, two localization techniques are probed within a reverberated indoor environment. Despite the challenges of acoustic signal processing and real-time event localization, the average error obtained in our system is as low as 22 cm inside an area of 2x2 m.", "Intervention activities in underwater environments are of great importance in many areas, such as the exploration, monitoring and documentation of sea resources, historical treasures or industrial applications. The use of robotic systems and automatic procedures is becoming fundamental, since the work conditions for divers are risky and often unfeasible, and several kind of works are every way impossible for humans. One of the most important objectives of the underwater robotic research consists in making technological systems friendly and easy to use by all kind of experts. This paper presents the development and test of a Force Feedback (FFB) Joystick aimed at supporting ROVs pilots during their work. Reaction forces on the joystick axes, based on specific error parameters, let the pilot understand in real-time the underwater environment where the robot is moving and thruster velocity saturation limits, thus improving significantly the efficiency of the given mission. The present work describes the design, assembly and programming of the joystick, and its test within a virtual environment simulating the real time control of Internet-enabled smart ROVs operating in remote locations. Results obtained with this kind of applications are discussed, and potentiality of the systems are underlined for future developments.", "Recent developments in human-robot interaction show how the ability to communicate with people in a natural way is of great importance for artificial agents. The implementation of facial expressions has been found to significantly increase the interaction capabilities of humanoid robots. For speech, displaying a correct articulation with sound is mandatory to avoid audiovisual illusions like the McGurk effect (leading to comprehension errors) as well as to enhance the intelligibility in noise. This work describes the design, construction and testing of an animatronic talking face developed for the iCub robot. This talking head has an articulated jaw and four independent lip movements actuated by five motors.

The robot follows a free trajectory which is controlled by artificial vision and fuzzy logic modules. The artificial vision system includes a webcam located in the upper part of the distribution center and it is used to calculate the location of the robot. Specifically, image segmentation technique of red color was implemented in the artificial vision system to determine the robot's position and orientation. The information obtained from the webcam is also used by the fuzzy controller to estimate the robot's velocity which is then send to the mobile robot wirelessly. The control of the motors and the wireless communication of the robot are performed by an Arduino platform which supports an Xbee module for communications. The image processing and fuzzy control are implemented on a PC using Matlab.", "The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of hyperspectral near-infrared (NIR) reflectance imaging techniques for detecting cuticle cracks on tomatoes. A hyperspectral NIR reflectance imaging system that analyzed the spectral region of 1000-1700 nm was used to obtain hyperspectral reflectance images of 224 tomatoes: 112 with and 112 without cracks along the stem-scar region. The hyperspectral images were subjected to partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to classify and detect cracks on the tomatoes. Two morphological features, roundness (R) and minimum-maximum distance (D), were calculated from the PLS-DA images to quantify the shape of the stem scar. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and a support vector machine (SVM) were then used to classify R and D. The results revealed 94.6% and 96.4% accuracy for classifications made using LDA and SVM, respectively, for tomatoes with and without crack defects. These data suggest that the hyperspectral near-infrared reflectance imaging system, in addition to traditional NIR spectroscopy-based methods, could potentially be used to detect crack defects on tomatoes and perform quality assessments.", "Robustness and efficiency of indoor navigation at high rates is crucial for aerial vehicle to perform maneuvering action and fast exploration. In recent years, optical flow sensors have shown its effectiveness on indoor navigation of mobile robot. However the fatal problem of optical flow's drifting can only be solved by building a map using SLAM (Simultaneously Localization and Mapping), which would drop the rate to nearly 30Hz. Navigation using artificial landmarks is the earliest visual navigation method implement on mobile robot, which, also has a limitation when the number of visible artificial landmark is insufficient. This paper explore the feasibility of combination of navigation from optical flow and artificial landmarks which will complement mutually. The integrated navigation system is experimented on the aerial vehicle exploring the laboratory, comparing with the optical flow method and landmarks method separately.", "Novel information and communication technologies create possibilities to change the future of health care and support.

The system architecture and the upgrade status will be presented.", "Farmers continue to show great differences in irrigation water use, even for a given location and crop. Irrigation advisory services have narrowed the gap between scientific knowledge and on-farm scheduling, but their success has been limited. The performance of sprinkler irrigation is greatly affected by factors such as wind speed, whose short-time variability requires tactical adjustments of the irrigation schedule. Mounting energy costs often require the consideration of interday and intraday tariff evolution. Opportunities have arisen that allow these challenges to be addressed through irrigation controllers guided by irrigation and crop simulation models. Remote control systems are often installed in collective pressurized irrigation networks. Agrometeorological information networks are available in regions worldwide. Water users' associations use specialized databases for water management. Different configurations of irrigation controllers based on simulation models can develop, continuously update, and execute irrigation schedules aiming at maximizing irrigation adequacy and water productivity. Bottlenecks requiring action in the fields of research, development, and innovation are analyzed, with the goal of establishing agendas leading to the implementation and commercial deployment of advanced controllers for solid-set irrigation.", "A primary factor limiting the development, testing, and validation of decentralized algorithms for large-scale multi-robot teams is the high cost of the available systems.

With the continued progress of the ubiquitous computing movement, everyday objects are coming to life and will soon enter these augmented spaces. Little has been studied regarding gestural control of everyday objects capable of movement in three-dimensional space. In the present study, we augment an office lamp for gestural interaction and use it toward finding more natural gestures for augmented workspace interaction with physical objects. We begin by surveying the current literature on user-defined gesture sets and digital augmentation of lamps to determine features desirable in the design of an actuated desk lamp. A prototypical Tabletop Assistive Droid (TAD) is then used in a study conducted to determine and analyze a feasible user-defined gesture set.", "This paper explores the use of variable friction surface haptics enabled by the TPad Tablet to support affective communication between pairs of users. We introduce three haptic applications for the TPad Tablet (text messaging, image sharing, and virtual touch) and evaluate the applications with 24 users, including intimate couples and strangers. Participants used haptics to communicate literal texture, denote action within a scene, convey emotional information, highlight content, express and engage in physical playfulness, and to provide one's partner with an experience or sensation. We conclude that users readily associate haptics with emotional expression and that the intimacy of touch in the contexts we study is best suited for communications with close social partners.", "Aggregation in swarm robotics is referred to as the gathering of spatially distributed robots into a single aggregate. Aggregation can be classified as cue-based or self-organized. In cue-based aggregation, there is a cue in the environment that points to the aggregation area, whereas in self-organized aggregation no cue is present. In this paper, we proposed a novel fuzzy-based method for cue-based aggregation based on the state-of-the-art BEECLUST algorithm. In particular, we proposed three different methods: naive, that uses a deterministic decision-making mechanism; vector-averaging, using a vectorial summation of all perceived inputs; and fuzzy, that uses a fuzzy logic controller. We used different experiment settings: one-source and two-source environments with static and dynamic conditions to compare all the methods. We observed that the fuzzy method outperformed all the other methods and it is the most robust method against noise.", "This paper introduces a novel algorithm to obtain attitude estimations from low cost 9 Degree of Freedom Inertial Measurement Units. This nonlinear attitude estimator is formulated in the Special Orthogonal Group SO(3) based on the Lyapunov theory. The performance of the proposed estimator is compared to current commonly used methods, namely the Extended Kalman Filter and two other nonlinear estimators in SO(3), in computer simulations for a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.", "A distributed multistage software router (MSSR) is composed by several interconnected software routers running on personal computers (PCs). The MSSR architecture overcomes scalability and performance issues of single software router by providing parallel forwarding paths. Like many networking devices, a MSSR must be sized for peak traffic load, which implies energy inefficiency at low loads. Thus, we focus on energy saving schemes to improve the router energy efficiency by dynamically adapting the MSSR architecture to the currently offered load. We first introduce an optimal energy saving algorithm defined as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Then, heuristic solutions, named differential algorithms are discussed. While the optimal approach provides higher energy savings, the heuristics avoid the complete MSSR reconfiguration, thus reducing forwarding delays and minimizing service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic algorithms, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserve the load proportional energy demand characteristics of the optimal algorithm, with a minimal loss of efficiency, largely compensated by algorithm simplicity.

This paper presents a model and its hardware real-time architecture in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to be integrated in a robotic system that emulates this powerful biological process. It is based on the combination of bottom-up saliency and top-down task-dependent modulation. The bottom-up stream is deployed including local energy, orientation, color opponencies, and motion maps. The most novel part of this work is the saliency modulation by two high-level features: 1) optical flow and 2) disparity. Furthermore, the influence of the features may be adjusted depending on the application. The proposed system reaches 180 fps for resolution. Finally, an example shows its modulation potential for driving assistance systems.", "Providing identity management (IdM) in the scene of Web of Things (WoT) is an important requirement to ensure protection of user data made available or consumed by the medical devices in WoT. This work aims to purpose the use of a user-centric IdM system in an ambient assisted living (AAL) environment in the WoT scenario. The IdM system is based on OpenID Connect that attends some of the main security requirements of an AAL environment.", "In a millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system with transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) beamforming antennas, small variation in device behavior or an environmental change can destroy beam alignment, resulting in power loss in the received signal. In this situation, the beam-tracking technique purely based on the received signal is not effective because both behavioral changes (rotation, displacement) and environmental changes (blockage) result in power loss in the received signal. In this paper, a motion sensor based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as well as an electrical signal is used for beam tracking to identify the cause of beam error, and an efficient beam-tracking technique is proposed. The motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and geo-magnetic sensor are composed of an attitude heading reference system (AHRS) and a zero-velocity detector (ZVD). The AHRS estimates the rotation angle and the ZVD detects whether the device moves. The proposed technique tracks a beam by handling the specific situation depending on the cause of beam error, minimizing the tracking overhead. The performance of the proposed beam-tracking technique is evaluated by simulations in three typical scenarios.", "This half day course introduces the field of musical interface design and implementation. Participants will learn and practice key aspects of the theory and practice of designing original interactive music technology with case studies including augmented and sensor based instruments, audio-visual instruments, mobile, and networked music making. Digital technologies offer powerful opportunities for the creation and manipulation of sound, however the flexibility of these technologies implies a confusing array of choices for musical composers and performers. Some artists have faced this challenge by using computers directly to create new musical forms. However, most would agree the computer is not a musical instrument, in the same sense as traditional instruments, and it is natural to ask 'how to play the computer' in a way appropriate to human brains and bodies. To attempt to answer this question in the course, we draw from the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) [1,2], which began as a workshop of CHI 2001 [3] and explore connections with the established field of human-computer interaction.", "As additive manufacturing of mechanical parts gains broad acceptance, efforts to embed electronic or electromechanical components in these parts are intensifying. We discuss recent work in printable electronics and introduce an alternative, which we call Bitblox. Bitblox are small, modular, interconnecting blocks that embed simple electromechanical connectivity and functionality. Not all blocks are identical; instead the unique combinations and positions of Bitblox within an assembly determine the mechanical and electrical properties of the assembly.

Multiple tactors (tactile elements) may be activated in combination to approximate a vibration point (virtual tactor) having arbitrary position and intensity. We studied the combination of intensities from multiple tactors to guide virtual tactor rendering approaches. Subjects matched perceived loudness of multi-tactor vibrations to a reference tactor. The multi-tactor vibrations corresponded to overall perceived positions halfway between tactor pairs and in the center of a 2D 4-tactor group. Results inform the relationship between tactor signal level and perceived loudness at these critical positions. The relationship leads us to propose a nonlinear 2D rendering approach, provides a basis for assessment of existing rendering techniques, and lays a foundation for further study of 2D array rendering.", "Internet broadband access is becoming a reality in many countries. To fully exploit the benefits from high-speed connection, both suitable home network connectivity and advanced services support have to be made available to the user.

However, prior studies of this approach have been limited and have not considered a high degree of antenna reconfigurability. This paper uses simulations and experimental measurements to characterize the impact of reconfigurable antenna complexity on the performance of key establishment in different static propagation environments and in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. The results demonstrate that reconfigurable antennas can significantly enhance the security, even when the eavesdropper antennas are adjacent to or surround one of the legitimate nodes. The results further demonstrate that increasing the number of reconfigurable parasitic elements notably increases the achieved performance.", null, "Though many advances have been made in the field of multi-agent robotic swarms, most results are limited to computer simulations instead of actual implantation to a robotic system. A primary factor limiting the development, testing, and validation of decentralized algorithms for large-scale multi-robot teams is the high cost of the available systems. A low budget but highly flexible platform could create a foundation that would allow researchers to evaluate their control algorithms under real world constraints. This paper presents Spider-Bots, a low cost and versatile platform for testing and validating control algorithms for multi-robot swarms. The system is consisted of centimeter-scale mobile robots that can communicate wirelessly and interact with their environment, along with simple and easy to use software libraries. Once completed, the platform was validated by executing three distinct algorithms: Waypoint navigation, object manipulation, and collision avoidance.", "Understanding the complex properties of electronic and spintronic devices at the micro-and nanoscale is a topic of intense current interest as it becomes increasingly important for scientific progress and technological applications. In operando characterization of such devices by scanning probe techniques is particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have developed a scanning probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard force imaging (atomic, magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical transport measurements. We utilize flexible and inexpensive FPGA (field-programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework developed in National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of microscope operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables sensitive, real-time cantilever frequency-shift detection. Using this system, we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy of an electrically biased graphene field-effect transistor device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport also enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided by the scanned cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in the experimental sciences and the openness of our software solution, our system permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport measurements by providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a measurement (input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also enables precise control of timing (synchronization of scanning and transport operations) and implementation of sophisticated feedback protocols, and thus should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.

A low-cost, customized optical sensor positioning system has been developed, with desirable high performance. Unlike the traditional dead-reckoning method using rotary encoders, optical mouse sensors are unacted on the errors induced by wheel slippage. However, some research has indicated that height variations can bring errors in 2D displacement measurements when using optical mouse sensors. What's more, the so-called error cumulative phenomenon is an inevitable problem to every motion positioning system. To overcome these weaknesses, our main contributions are in two aspects. One is that a new adaptation mechanism is presented to enhance the positioning robustness to surface height variations. This performance enhancement attributes to the height-variation awareness of our presented system, in addition to the required positioning capability. The other is that a novel calibration paradigm with the assisted landmarks is proposed to eliminate the error cumulative phenomenon. This induced performance enhancement benefits from the high-speed optic flow sensing capability of optical mouse sensors. Experimental results are reported to validate the enhancement capability of the presented positioning system.", "This paper presents a novel solution for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) to autonomously search for and land on an arbitrary landing site using real-time monocular vision. The autonomous MAV is provided with only one single reference image of the landing site with an unknown size before initiating this task. We extend a well-known monocular visual SLAM algorithm that enables autonomous navigation of the MAV in unknown environments, in order to search for such landing sites. Furthermore, a multi-scale ORB feature based method is implemented and integrated into the SLAM framework for landing site detection. We use a RANSAC-based method to locate the landing site within the map of the SLAM system, taking advantage of those map points associated with the detected landing site. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented vision system in autonomous flights, both indoor and in challenging outdoor environment.", null, "In GPS-denied environments like in indoor applications, location systems based on Vicon cameras, infrared cameras or UWB techniques are generally employed to provide location information of multiple mobile robots. The location systems require expensive and external equipments, which limits the applicable range of micro unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-denied environments. In the paper, efficient control schemes based on onboard commodity sensors are presented for autonomous UAVs in indoor applications, where the horizontal displacement of the platform is provided by an optical flow sensor. With the aid of lightweight onboard sensors, a complete 6-degree of freedom (DOF) state of the UAV can be estimated. Control strategies are presented for low-level stabilization as well as high-level tracking and formation control. Experiments illustrate that the UAVs with onboard sensing and computation can achieve autonomous trajectory tracking and distributed formation flight based on a leader-follower scheme.", "Electrical stimulation (ES) of cells has been shown to induce a variety of responses, such as cytoskeleton rearrangements, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In this study, we have investigated whether monophasic and biphasic pulsed ES could exert any effect on the proliferation and differentiation of human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) isolated from human heart fragments. Cells were cultured under continuous exposure to monophasic or biphasic ES with fixed cycles for 1 or 3 days. Results indicate that neither stimulation protocol affected cell viability, while the cell shape became more elongated and reoriented more perpendicular to the electric field direction. Moreover, the biphasic ES clearly induced the upregulation of early cardiac transcription factors, MEF2D, GATA-4, and Nkx2.5, as well as the de novo expression of the late cardiac sarcomeric proteins, troponin T, cardiac alpha actinin, and SERCA 2a. Both treatments increased the expression of connexin 43 and its relocation to the cell membrane, but biphasic ES was faster and more effective. Finally, when hCPCs were exposed to both monophasic and biphasic ES, they expressed de novo the mRNA of the voltage-dependent calcium channel Cav 3.1((1G)) subunit, which is peculiar of the developing heart. Taken together, these results show that ES alone is able to set the conditions for early differentiation of adult hCPCs toward a cardiac phenotype.", "In this paper, we present a distributed control strategy, enabling agents to converge onto and travel along a consensually selected curve among a class of closed planar curves. Individual agents identify the number of neighbors within a finite circular sensing range and obtain information from their neighbors through local communication. The information is then processed to update the control parameters and force the swarm to converge onto and circulate along the aforementioned planar curve. The proposed mathematical framework is based on stochastic differential equations driven by white Gaussian noise (diffusion processes). Using this framework, there is maximum probability that the swarm dynamics will be driven toward the consensual closed planar curve. In the simplest configuration where a circular consensual curve is obtained, we are able to derive an analytical expression that relates the radius of the circular formation to the agent's interaction range. Such an intimate relation is also illustrated numerically for more general curves. The agent-based control strategy is then translated into a distributed Braitenberg-inspired one. The proposed robotic control strategy is then validated by numerical simulations and by implementation on an actual robotic swarm. It can be used in applications that involve large numbers of locally interacting agents, such as traffic control, deployment of communication networks in hostile environments, or environmental monitoring.", "This paper presents the TraxBot robot and its full integration in the Robotic Operating System (ROS).

This orchestrator is implemented in a micro cloud server whose role is to manage centralized as well as distributed wireless sensor nodes.

The article develops a contextual typology of user production by theorizing it as a cultural form. Primary forms discussed include those of buyer; source, subject, interviewee; contestant; supplier; financier; inventor; activist; and member, all of which are related to their generative formations and conditions. The article concludes by suggesting the kinds of questions and studies that such a framework makes possible.", "Localization microscopy achieves nanoscale spatial resolution by iterative localization of sparsely activated molecules, which generally leads to a long acquisition time. By implementing advanced algorithms to treat overlapping point spread functions (PSFs), imaging of densely activated molecules can improve the limited temporal resolution, as has been well demonstrated in two-dimensional imaging. However, three-dimensional (3D) localization of high-density data remains challenging since PSFs are far more similar along the axial dimension than the lateral dimensions. Here, we present a new, high-density 3D imaging system and algorithm. The hybrid system is implemented by combining astigmatic and biplane imaging. The proposed 3D reconstruction algorithm is extended from our state-of-the art 2D high-density localization algorithm. Using mutual coherence analysis of model PSFs, we validated that the hybrid system is more suitable than astigmatic or biplane imaging alone for 3D localization of high-density data. The efficacy of the proposed method was confirmed via simulation and real data of microtubules. Furthermore, we also successfully demonstrated fluorescent-protein-based live cell 3D localization microscopy with a temporal resolution of just 3 seconds, capturing fast dynamics of the endoplasmic recticulum.

The system then automatically chooses the optimal alarm time within that range to minimize sleep inertia in the user after waking. Worn as a wristband, Aegis continuously processes their movement readings to map their sleep stages throughout the night, and remembers the individual user's typical sleep pattern from previous nights, combining these two sources of data to predict where in the sleep cycle the user-set time range will fall. Because sleep inertia is caused by an interruption of deep sleep, Aegis chooses its alarm time to coincide with periods of light sleep, and wakes up the user by vibrating the wristband instead of sounding an alarm, to minimize noise disturbance of roommates, spouses, and/or family members. Preliminary performance evaluation demonstrated the ability of Aegis to track sleep patterns and user satisfaction was confirmed via questionnaires and debriefing.", "Visual motion estimation is a computationally intensive, but important task for sighted animals. Replicating the robustness and efficiency of biological visual motion estimation in artificial systems would significantly enhance the capabilities of future robotic agents. Twenty five years ago, in this very journal, Carver Mead outlined his argument for replicating biological processing in silicon circuits. His vision served as the foundation for the field of neuromorphic engineering, which has experienced a rapid growth in interest over recent years as the ideas and technologies mature. Replicating biological visual sensing was one of the first tasks attempted in the neuromorphic field. In this paper, we focus specifically on the task of visual motion estimation.

Widespread disconnection was observed primarily in cortical hubs known to manifest early Alzheimer's disease pathology, namely precuneus, parietal lobules, supramarginal and angular gyri, and cuneus, with additional involvement of subcortical regions, sensorimotor cortex and insula. The connectivity changes determined using graph-based analysis significantly exceed those detected using independent component analysis both in amplitude and topographical extent, and are largely decoupled from the presence of overt atrophy. This superior ability of graph-based analysis to detect disease-related disconnection highlights its potential use in the determination of biomarkers of early dementia.

The architecture is composed of two layers where each layer is intended to react in an analogous way to how our brain reacts to external and internal stimuli, using instinctive or deliberative reactions. The first layer, the Drive/Emotional Controller (DE Controller), uses Action Programs which are instinctual, low-level responses to a certain external stimuli. The second layer, the Deliberative/Reflective Controller (DR Controller), can only react to changes in the internal state of the DE controller. Memory, self-reflection, feelings and imagination are some of the concepts that could be considered by the DR Controller architecture, which is intended to generate high-level conscious reactions. These controllers integrate emotions into standard behavior-based architectures. We tested the proposed architecture in a task of free exploration using MODE a two-wheeled mobile robot.

If not being accounted for, these may cause serious damage to the robot and/or its environment. Fast and robust collision detection combined with safe reaction is therefore essential in this context. Deliberate physical interaction may also be required in some applications. The robot can then switch into an interaction mode when contact occurs. The control loop must also be designed with interaction in mind. To implement these mechanisms, knowledge of environmental interaction forces is required. In principle, they may be measured or estimated. In this paper, we present a novel model-based method for external wrench estimation in flying robots. The estimation is based on proprioceptive sensors and the robot's dynamics model only. Using this estimate, we also design admittance and impedance controllers for sensitive and robust physical interaction. We also investigate the performance of our collision detection and reaction schemes in order to guarantee collision safety. Upon collision, we determine the collision location and normal located on the robot's geometric model. The method relies on the complete wrench information provided by our scheme.

At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.", "The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols.

Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline.

Instead, we are in a new age where technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology development is often theoretical explored around the concept of platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source software, academics have long been examining openness in digital platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely, the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable software 'apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by acknowledging that openness means different things to different people and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital platforms/ecosystems perspective.

Designing a robust control system requires to test the control algorithms in the actual controller hardware. However, WT are large and expensive, thus we would like to perform this test virtually, without using prototypes of the WT. This work develops a fault diagnosis (FD) and fault tolerant control (FTC) of pitch actuators in wind turbines. This is accomplished by combining a disturbance compensator with a controller, both of which are formulated in the discrete-time domain. The disturbance compensator has a dual purpose: to reconstruct the actuator fault (which is used by the FD technique) and to design the discrete-time controller to obtain a FTC. That is, the actuator faults are reconstructed and then the control inputs are modified to achieve a FTC with a comparable behavior to the fault-free case. The performance of the FD and FTC schemes is tested in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testbed for WT controllers. The used controller hardware is an open hardware Arduino board which is connected to the virtual WT via USB.

The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas, and welding velocity. The results showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100 in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3D printing community.", ["This work presents the development of a Supervisory, Control And Data Adquisition (SCADA) using open hardware and free software, for an NBS BioFlo III bioreactor system used in a laboratory inside Universidad Nacional de Quilmes.", "Design and development of the SCADA BioFlo III system it's based in a web server connected with the fermenter.

This concept paper aims to establish a framework to help GFSP fully leverage the potential of open models. In preparing this paper the authors spoke to many different GFSP stakeholders who asked questions about open models such as: what is it?what's in it for me?why use an open rather than a proprietary model?how will open models generate equivalent or greater sustainable revenue streams compared to the current \"traditional\" approaches? This last question came up many times with assertions that traditional service providers need to see opportunity for equivalent or greater revenue dollars before they will buy-in. This paper identifies open value propositions for GFSP stakeholders and proposes a framework for creating and structuring that value. Open Educational Resources (OER) were the primary open practice GFSP partners spoke to us about, as they provide a logical entry point for collaboration. Going forward, funders should consider requiring that educational resources and concomitant data resulting from their sponsorship should be open, as a public good. There are, however, many other forms of open practice that bring value to the GFSP. Nine different open strategies and tactics (Appendix A) are described, including: open content (including OER and open courseware), open data, open access (research), open government, open source software, open standards, open policy, open licensing and open hardware. It is recommended that all stakeholders proactively pursue \"openness\" as an operating principle.

We have previously developed automated irrigation controllers that use capacitance sensors and dataloggers to supply plants with on-demand irrigation. However, the dataloggers and accompanying software used to build and program those controllers make these systems expensive. Relatively new, low-cost open-source microcontrollers provide an alternative way to build sensor-based irrigation controllers for both agricultural and domestic applications. We designed and built an automated irrigation system using a microcontroller, capacitance soil moisture sensors, and solenoid valves. This system effectively monitored and controlled VWC over a range of irrigation thresholds (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m(3).m(-3)) with 'Panama Red' hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella) in a peat:perlite substrate.

Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that \"smart\" urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, \"smart city\" approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on \"smart\" initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city.

Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services.", "Practical implications - In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality.

Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices.

In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers.

In this paper we evaluate the accuracy of a system consisting of a lidar sensor on a small UAV. High geometric accuracy in the produced point cloud is a fundamental qualification for detection and recognition of objects in a single-flight dataset as well as for change detection using two or several data collections over the same scene. Our work presented here has two purposes: first to relate the point cloud accuracy to data processing parameters and second, to examine the influence on accuracy from the UAV platform parameters. In our work, the accuracy is numerically quantified as local surface smoothness on planar surfaces, and as distance and relative height accuracy using data from a terrestrial laser scanner as reference. The UAV lidar system used is the Velodyne HDL-32E lidar on a multirotor UAV with a total weight of 7 kg. For processing of data into a geographically referenced point cloud, positioning and orientation of the lidar sensor is based on inertial navigation system (INS) data combined with lidar data. The combination of INS and lidar data is achieved in a dynamic calibration process that minimizes the navigation errors in six degrees of freedom, namely the errors of the absolute position (x, y, z) and the orientation (pitch, roll, yaw) measured by GPS/INS.

We are now able to communicate and interact with our surrounding environment through the use of multiple tiny sensors, REID technologies or small wireless robots. This allows a set of new applications and usages to be envisioned ranging from logistic and traceability purposes to emergency and rescue operations going through the monitoring of volcanos or forest fires.

For a demand-response system to have significant impact on the electric grid system, citizens must behave responsibly, so teaching children (and their families) how the system works provides an opportunity to enhance the introduce of a national demand-response system. The didactic tool, named aty arandu, was developed as a plug-in for Turtle Bots software, allowing students to explore and learn about energy sources and the responsible use of them. We postulate that students who are in control of their learning are more effective learners [11]."], "The consumer market ever more calls for diversified products in small batches and the industry lacks production systems that meet the demands with efficiency and ability to adapt quickly. Integrated manufacturing systems implemented have their management for programmable logic controllers and electrical interconnections, control logic and satisfactory robustness, but they do not attend the needs of diversity and flexibility in production. The solutions to these needs refer the company to migrate to the use of new technologies of control, circuit and logic. But, for an industry migrates is a very big and expensive step. Then, there is an urgent need for methods that implement the interface between logic controllers and multi-agent systems in order to evolve an integrated manufacturing system taking advantage of all electrical circuitry, control logic and the logic controller that installs itself, taking advantage of the self-adapting characteristics that the multi-agent systems provide.", "This paper represents an Automated Balancing Platform using Arduino Uno(ATmega328 microcontroller). Arduino is a low-cost popular prototyping platform. In this project Arduino Uno is used to process any disturbance and give instruction to balancing mechanism to set its location at the set point. The system consists of Arduino Uno platform, 3 DC motors (12V, 500mA), two L298 (46V, 4A), position controlling mechanism of platform, two degree of freedom robotic arm which is placed on the Automated Balancing platform.", "This paper is based on the experience of introducing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) into the building industry in Denmark and in a rural area of Greenland. There are very real advantages in the application of the technology and its consequences for the life cycle operation of the building sector. Sensor networks can be seen as an important part of the Internet of Things and may even constitute an Internet of Sensors, since the communication layers can differ from the Internet standards. The current paper describes the case for application, followed by a discussion of the observed adaptive advantages and consequences of the technology. Essentially, WSNs constitute a highly sophisticated technology that is more robust in a rural context due to its extremely simple installation procedures (plug and play) allowing the use of local less- skilled labour, and the possibility of reconfiguring and repurposing its use remotely.", "This paper tells a story of DIY (do it yourself) making that does not neatly fit more familiar narratives of making: as individual empowerment, as a democratizing force, and as technoscientific innovation. Drawing on ethnographic research with a collective of elderly electronic hackers in China, we provide insights into the socio-technical and politico-economic processes of hacking and making. This paper examines how the activity of making functioned for elderly DIY enthusiasts as way of remaking and reliving the past and as a means for expressing class belonging and citizenship. We show that making and hacking is not practiced in a void independent of social, political or economic forces. Rather, making unfolds in relation to, and is contingent on, societal norms and specific techno-cultural histories. As much as hacking empowers certain people, it excludes others and functions as a site for the exercise of power and social distinction making.", "Caught between the infinite promise unleashed by technology proliferation and the unprecedented scale of resource depletion, waste and inequity, we inhabit a space where critical alternatives are sought more than ever. As a reflection of the above, we find in HCI, a slant towards technological quick-fixes to existing sustainability problems, as opposed to a more holistic approach that includes behavioural and societal change. It is within this context that this paper is situated, where we propose a socio-ecological approach and argue our case for a life-cycle lens towards building systems that are in line with our current understanding of the earth's finite resources. We do so by presenting an illustrative case study of what such critical alternatives might look like, by examining the Fairphone movement. We contribute to a deeper understanding of how social value laden enterprises along with open technological design can shape sustainable relationships between our environment and us.", "This paper presents a system for arrhythmia analysis. This system analyze electrocardiogram signal of patient and recommend yoga accordingly. Now a day's arrhythmia is the leading cause of death in many countries. Hence capturing and diagnosis of electrocardiogram signal is important. As yoga is one of the traditional arts, its preservation is important and it is possible only by using yoga in practice. Clamp electrodes are used for ECG signal capturing and amplification done by an instrumentation amplifier. For analog to digital form conversion of ECG signal, DAC card is useful. Then ECG signal features are extracted in mat lab and extracted features are given to the feed-forward back propagation neural network for classification. Here ECG signal is classified as normal, tachycardia and bradycardia arrhythmia. Accordingly this system suggests yoga to the heart patient.", "Autonomous sailboats are good candidates for long term oceanic surveys, since they use wind power as their main mean of propulsion. Controlling a sailboat, however, is typically not an easy task due to the high variability in the wind and the side drift of the boat. In this paper, we describe how we design and set up the control architecture that allows Aeolus, the autonomous model sailboat of ETH Zurich, to sail upwind and execute fast and smooth tack maneuvers. Different controllers to actuate the rudder have been implemented and validated for both the upwind sailing and the tack maneuver. We present experimental results obtained during several autonomous sailing tests at the lake Zurich.", null, "An instant messenger service is one of the most useful mobile apps for exchanging messages and photos with friends. The infrastructural needs of such services are rapidly growing with user demand for high-quality service, and high-end computing with sufficient resources are required to meet these demands. However, the amount of power required to maintain such a massive infrastructure is impractically high. We present a novel policy to exploit energy-efficient storage servers for instant messenger services. Because instant messages often include personal information, the storage servers must be protected from unauthorized access. This requirement can be expanded to develop a creative policy for reducing power consumption. We validate our proposal by conducting four experiments, the results of which are expected to play an important role in designing energy-efficient servers for instant messenger services.", "We present a Bayesian approach to tactile object recognition that improves on state-of-the-art in using single-touch events in two ways. First by improving recognition accuracy from about 90% to about 95%, using about half the number of touches. Second by reducing the number of touches needed for training from about 200 to about 60. In addition, we use a new tactile sensor that is less than one tenth of the cost of widely available sensors. The paper describes the sensor, the likelihood function used with the Naive Bayes classifier, and experiments on a set of ten real objects. We also provide preliminary results to test our approach for its ability to generalise to previously unencountered objects.", "With the constant development in the robotics field, many solutions require a high hardware complexity to be executed resulting in an expensive robotic system. Furthermore, these solutions are usually closed box implementations that are hard to be reproduced. Hence, this project proposes a system structure to reduce these difficulties in robotics development. This system consists of a low cost robot with an embedded Android phone in a ROS environment. For testing this implementation, two Android phones, a laptop and a robot with an Arduino microcontroller have been used. The results of the study demonstrated several advantages of using this system, such as incorporating processing and sensing from the smartphone on the robot, having external heavy processing in a Server outside the robot and being able to connect the robot to the cloud. Therefore, using a popular Android device running a Rosjava application can be very useful in robotics applications and development, mainly due to the possibilities provided by this simple system.", "This work describes a practical solution for the problem of cryptographic key establishment and secure communication in the context of the Internet of Things.ln which computational efficiency is a fundamental requirement.

Tests were executed on the EPOSMoteII platform and the analysis of the results shows that the implementation is adequate to be used in the scenario of embedded systems with low processing power.", "To be effective team members, it is important for robots to understand the high-level behaviors of collocated humans. This is a challenging perceptual task when both the robots and people are in motion. In this paper, we describe an event-based model for multiple robots to automatically measure synchronous joint action of a group while both the robots and co-present humans are moving. We validated our model through an experiment where two people marched both synchronously and asynchronously, while being followed by two mobile robots. Our results suggest that our model accurately identifies synchronous motion, which can enable more adept human-robot collaboration.", "In this paper, we present Virtual Touch, a toolkit that allows the development of educational activities through a mixed reality environment such that, using various tangible elements, the interconnection of a virtual world with the real world is enabled. The main goal of Virtual Touch is to facilitate the installation, configuration and programming of different types of technologies, abstracting the creator of educational applications from the technical details involving the use of tangible interfaces and virtual worlds. Therefore, it is specially designed to enable teachers to themselves create educational activities for their students in a simple way, taking into account that teachers generally lack advanced knowledge in computer programming and electronics. The toolkit has been used to develop various educational applications that have been tested in two secondary education high schools in Spain.", ["In this study we explore the possibility of organizing and structuring an information technology training day for upper secondary vocational teacher training in automotive and transport engineering. The objective is to show the development process of the three training sessions in response to survey data completed by teachers. Information technology has widely penetrated into the car industry during the last few decades but some teachers have difficulty in adapting and teaching new technologies to their students. This paper presents one approach to break the ice between 'old school' teachers and information technology, through the use of an 8-hour training day consisting of programming, electronic technology and data bus technology.", "The aim of this study is to discover how to structure training of new technology for experienced vocational teachers. In this paper we describe how we developed, organized and assessed information technology training for vocational teachers within the case study. The training day was organized in three locations in Finland: Pori, Jyvaskyla and Vantaa. After the first surveys were completed by the vocational teachers, the arrangement of the next training day was adjusted in response to the outcome of the initial surveys. After the first lecture session, the training feedback indicated that there should be more 'learning-by-doing' type of action. The next sessions included Arduino board [1], electronic components and a laptop software development environment.", "In this study we found that the attitudes of the training attendees were different in three locations around Finland. This is an interesting finding. When comparing the results obtained from Jyvaskyla and Vantaa the outcomes were slightly more negative in Jyvaskyla than in Vantaa. However the training was identical in both cases. The results also showed a difference in attitude between teachers of different age groups.", "One of the biggest problems in this type of training was the limitation of time. Most of the teachers were familiar with the automotive based digital testing equipment, but they were also aware that their students were far more advanced in information technology than they were. This may have generated tensions and resistance from the older generation of teacher when adopting any new technology.", "The overall outcome was positive. Teachers were pleased with this training in an automotive context, because it was first time they had received generic technological training. The attendees felt it was important because the training sessions were targeted directly to them. The collected survey results provided information about what vocational teachers are actually missing in practice. In the conceptual part of this paper we discuss motivation to learn [2,3] and adult education. In the empirical part of this paper we introduce the training method utilized and finally discuss the presented outcomes and conclusions of the survey data."], "In this paper we present a method of detecting and tracking pedestrians from a moving vehicle. We accomplish this by using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as a detector and two tracking algorithms, the Kalman filter and the particle filter. The Kalman filter tracks the pedestrians on the road in-front of the vehicle. The particle filter is used to track the pedestrians on the sidewalk or those who are approaching the road from the side, where partial occlusion can occur. By combining these algorithms, we manage to improve the speed and accuracy since the detection algorithm detects the pedestrians, then the tracking algorithm tracks them.", null, "This paper details the design and development of a system that is intended to be used as a tool to educate and excite young school leaver to pursue engineering education, especially in the field of sensors and sensor applications. The system is essentially a home automation platform that allows users to interact with a network of sensors and actuators. The system consists of four hardware components; the computer/webserver that controls the network of sensors and actuators, the device the user will use to access the web server, the sensors/actuators of the system, and the microcontroller that bridges the web server and the sensor/actuator network. The end user of this system will be expected to assemble various components of the system together and in doing so, will gain an exposure to the engineering field. This exposure will increase the awareness of what engineering entails and hopes to prompt future students to take up engineering as a field of study. The system, while being a platform for exposing engineering, can also be a platform for future projects requiring remote access to an autonomous sensor network with the ability to change the environment around them, such as zoological research projects tracking the endangered birds. Finally, the system, capable of sensing temperature and light, controlling 230V 10A mains appliances and a keyless entry device, could be used simply as a home automation system in its own right by an interested hobbyist.", "This paper describes study results regarding potential use of White Rabbit technology in Space Related Applications. During the study Technology Readiness Level and Compliance with Space Related Applications was evaluated. After considering possible deployment and development scenarios, main focus has been put on European Space Agency's tracking station system. This outcome derived from specific requirements of tracking system which are coherent with White Rabbit technology scope of application and further development plans. Current state of Time and Frequency Distribution technology implemented into tracking stations is based on multiple different technologies coexisting in parallel creating a complex system. It requires specific, custom made hardware to combine all the technologies which makes it expensive and difficult to maintain. White Rabbit could be use to reduce Time and Frequency Distribution to a single Ethernet based network with link redundancy, payload data transfer and sub-nanosecond accuracy.", "There are currently more than half a million diabetes cases in Cameroon and the deaths caused by diabetes complications will double before 2030. Diabetes complications mostly occur due to a bad follow-up of patients. In this paper, we propose a new IT architecture for diabetes follow-up and introduce the bases of a new distributed computation protocol for this architecture. Our approach does not require any preexisting support communication infrastructure, can be deployed at low cost, and provides strong privacy and security guarantees. This work envisions an experiment in the field we plan to conduct under the authority of the Cameroonian National Center for Diabetes and Hypertension, with a potential for generalization to other diseases.", "We examine the recent move from a rhetoric of \"users\" toward one of \"makers,\" \"crafters,\" and \"hackers\" within HCI discourse. Through our analysis, we make several contributions. First, we provide a general overview of the structure and common framings within research on makers. We discuss how these statements reconfigure themes of empowerment and progress that have been central to HCI rhetoric since the field's inception. In the latter part of the article, we discuss the consequences of these shifts for contemporary research problems. In particular, we explore the problem of designed obsolescence, a core issue for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) research. We show how the framing of the maker, as an empowered subject, presents certain opportunities and limitations for this research discourse. Finally, we offer alternative framings of empowerment that can expand maker discourse and its use in contemporary research problems such as SID.", "This paper describes the development of a simple, low-cost, embedded auto pilot for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and its integration to achieve self-flight capability using commercially available off-the shelf modules and components. The autopilot was developed using Arduino Mega 2560 embedded micro-controller platform and integrated with a DJI Spreading Wings S800 Hexa-copter platform, Wookong M Flight Stabilization Controller, and Sensors. A Ground Control Station (GCS) and a wireless communication system to communicate with the UAV was developed using Xbee modules and tested for real-time communication. GCS sends remote control commands, way-points and navigation plan to the on-board autopilot and receives data streams from the UAV. MATLAB was used for creating the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for communication. It is capable of sending commands to the micro-controller and receiving data and state information from the UAV in near-real time and was successfully used for tuning the autopilot. Autopilot development and integration was carried out in two stages: (1) Experiments for estimating the physical parameters and manually tuning the Thrust, Roll, Pitch and Yaw Control parameters using a RC-controller. (2) Coupling the Auto pilot (integrating the Arduino Mega 2560 embedded micro-controller) to the Platform and tuning Roll, Pitch, Yaw and thrust control for stable control manoeuvres. We also discuss some integration issues and report the results.", "This paper introduces the design and practical validation of a quaternion control scheme to globally stabilize a quadrotor aerial vehicle. First an attitude control law is proposed to stabilize the vehicle's heading, then a position control law is developed to stabilize the vehicle around a desired point. Using position references, a smooth trajectory is calculated for the attitude controller such that the position of the vehicle becomes stable. The proposed control algorithm allows a linear quadrotor system's behavior. The closed-loop system is then numerically simulated to corroborate stability.", "In technoscientific conditions what counts as knowledge creation is not primarily the individual experimental achievement that gives coherence to scientific practice and separates science from its publics; rather, it is a form of dispersed experimentation in more than human worlds: distributed invention power. Distributed invention power is organised and regulated through the pervasive securitisation of technoscience: surveillance and control of technoscientific fields as well as financialisation of its activities and research outputs. The securitisation of science reorders the traditional split between the public sphere, the private sector and the commons. The folding of each one of these spheres into the other underlies a constant, often antagonistic, oscillation between big science and open science. What is constitutive of the diverse movements that sustain open technoscience is not that they challenge technoscience as such but that they experiment with technoscience to create alternative forms of life.", "The paper describes an ongoing research on teacher education for the implementation of making and digital fabrication in educational settings taking part at LABoral Art Centre, Spain. It aims to define key points and indications for the design of learning environments for teachers through making and prototyping in the context of an art centre as an open education lab. We present a qualitative instrumental case study articulated around two dimensions: the analysis of the context of the art centre, and the design of two teaching education programs. The analysis of LABoral context aims to explore the potentiality of an open lab and its related community as a learning environment for teacher education. The study of the teaching education programs is set to define the principles in order to put forward a proposal for the design of a learning environment for teacher education in making.", "This paper describes the design and implementation of a smart sprinkler system, utilizing a mesh capable wireless sensor network for monitoring and controlling field irrigation systems. Soil types and their characteristics with regards to water retention were investigated. The hardware and software for the sensor and sink nodes were implemented using the core of the WSN communication Xbee Series II Zigbee modules. A user interface to monitor the sprinkler system and change control parameters was developed. The system was tested for accuracy by comparing sensory field data with comparable data from alternative sensors from agricultural field test laboratories. It was successful in controlling the soil moisture levels in the test field by keeping the moisture levels between the desired thresholds. A relatively inexpensive way to automate water irrigation was established using low cost components for small scale irrigation applications.", "ISHP (Ion Source Hydrogen Positive) project consists of a highly versatile ECR type ion source. It has been built for several purposes, on the one hand, to serve as a workbench to test accelerator related technologies and validate in-house made developments, at the first stages. On the other hand, to design an ion source valid as the first step in an actual LINAC. Since this paper is focused on the control system of ISHP, besides the ion source, all the hardware and its control architecture is presented. Nowadays the ion source is able to generate a pulse of positive ions of Hydrogen from 2 mu s to a few range with a repetition rate ranging from 1 Hz to 50 Hz with a maximum of 45 mA of current. Furthermore, the first experiments with White Rabbit (WR) synchronization system are presented.", "Over the last few years, depth cameras have become increasingly popular for a range of applications, including human-computer interaction and gaming, augmented reality, machine vision, and medical imaging. Many of the commercially-available devices use the time-of-flight principle, where active illumination is temporally coded and analyzed in the camera to estimate a per-pixel depth map of the scene. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new imaging modality for all time-of-flight (ToF) cameras: per-pixel radial velocity measurement. The proposed technique exploits the Doppler effect of objects in motion, which shifts the temporal illumination frequency before it reaches the camera. Using carefully coded illumination and modulation frequencies of the ToF camera, object velocities directly map to measured pixel intensities. We show that a slight modification of our imaging system allows for color, depth, and velocity information to be captured simultaneously. Combining the optical flow computed on the RGB frames with the measured metric radial velocity allows us to further estimate the full 3D metric velocity field of the scene. The proposed technique has applications in many computer graphics and vision problems, for example motion tracking, segmentation, recognition, and motion deblurring.", "A wireless sensor node platform was created along with a base station that can be used to monitor various parameters in the industry. A literature survey was conducted on important parameters found in the industry. The various standards that are set out for these parameters were analysed. The developed wireless sensor node platform along with the base station shows that a wide variety of industrial parameters can be monitored at once from one central place. The simplistic deployment/instalment of the created wireless sensor node platform along with the centralisation of important industrial parameters should appeal to large industries and reduce the risk of accidental unfortunate events.", "This essay reviews diverse strands of empirical and theoretical work in different urban studies areas (urban planning, urban ethnography, urban geography, and STS) reflecting on the manifold ways in which the smart city project is being \"opened up\" for scrutiny through experimental projects developing digitally-mediated sensing practices of either a specific or broad kind: i.e., producing both devices formally devised for sensing specific parameters, and sensing devices - emerging from less specific digital technology arrangements-used to share experiences, show solutions or politicize different urban issues. In doing this, we seek to understand, from an STS standpoint, the different ways in which a broad range of works are analysing the development, intervention, maintenance, and opposition of these ideas. In the first section we focus on understanding the definitions, features and clashes that several of these corporate projects (mostly municipal in nature) have come across, deploying smart devices, such as sensors to produce an \"algorithmic city\". In the second section we expand the meanings of \"smartness,\" focusing on grassroots appropriations of broader digital arrangements and politicizations of open source infrastructures to display other forms of urban sensitivities, contributing to the cosmopoliticization of the \"smart city\" project.", "In this work, an innovative idea of capturing human handwriting in real time using inertial sensors is introduced. The paper presents a novel way of using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to create a \"Smart pen\". This Smart Pen can detect changes in its orientation that occur during writing any word, or an alphabet. The onboard gyroscopes and accelerometers of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) calculate the values of yaw, pitch and roll angles made by the 3 dimensional geometry of the pen. These values are sent to a micro controller board using the Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol for serial communication. Depending on these values and the writing style of each letter, the Pen identifies which alphabet is written. The writing style of each person is different. Hence calibration for each person is necessary. This recognized alphabet/word can be displayed on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen which is interfaced to an Arduino board.", "This paper presents a dynamic image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control law for a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a single fixed on-board camera. The motion control problem is to regulate the relative position and yaw of the vehicle to a stationary target located on the ground. The control law is termed dynamic as it based on the dynamics and kinematics of the vehicle. The proposed design relies on the notion of a virtual camera and image moments as visual features to simplify the kinematics and dynamics. The convergence of the closed-loop is proven to be globally asymptotically stable. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the method's ease of onboard implementation, performance, and robustness.", "5-6 MHz PMNT/epoxy 1-3 composites were prepared by a modified dice-and-fill method. They exhibit excellent properties for ultrasonic transducer applications, such as ultrahigh thickness electromechanical coupling coefficient k(t) (85.7%), large piezoelectric coefficient d(33) (1209 pC/N), and relatively low acoustic impedance Z (1.82 x 10(7) kg/(m(2)s)). Besides, two types of Time-of-Flight Diffraction (TOFD) ultrasonic transducers have been designed, fabricated, and characterized, which have different matching layer schemes with the acoustic impedance of 4.8 and 5.7 x 10(6) kg/(m(2)s), respectively. In the detection on a backwall of 12.7 mm polystyrene, the former exhibits higher detectivity, the relative pulse-echo sensitivity and -6 dB relative bandwidth are -21.93 dB and 102.7%, respectively, while the later exhibits broader bandwidth, the relative pulse-echo sensitivity and -6 dB relative bandwidth are -24.08 dB and 117.3%, respectively.

The motion control problem is to regulate the relative lateral position of the vehicle to a stationary target located on the ground. The control law is termed dynamic as it is based on the dynamics and kinematics of the vehicle. The proposed design uses a nonlinear input-dependent change of state coordinates and its error dynamics are proven to be locally exponentially stable with an estimate provided for the region of attraction. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the method's ease of on-board implementation, performance, and robustness. The simulation and experimental results include a comparison with an established dynamic IBVS method. This comparison shows the proposed method can provide similar performance with the benefit of reduced complexity.", "This paper describes an experience, held with a class of primary school children, aimed to introduce a novel educational topic, the smart materials, and the interfaces built with them (Smart Material Interfaces). The pupils were guided along a multidisciplinary path in which traditional and innovative teaching methods were composed for educating while engaging the children. It led to the creation of 6 automated puppet plays focused on the themes of environmental awareness as a result. In this process, storytelling and visual programming acted as powerful means for merging different educational concepts and techniques. The data collected through the direct observation and the questionnaires indicate that the experience was perceived as positive and interesting.

However, the development and testing process of these control systems has been confined to a few specific cases, the details of which have not been thoroughly reported in available literature. This paper details the development, construction and implementation of a real-time, Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test set-up for such a control system. A general purpose, phasor-based control algorithm is deployed on a Compact Reconfigurable Input/Output (cRIO) controller from National Instruments. The complete, closed-loop experimental set-up, the hardware used and the rationale behind different design choices are also documented. As this test-set-up uses IEEE C37.118 data over a TCP/IP network, the complete, real-time data path is examined. A real-time HIL test with the implemented controller is also presented and results are analysed.", "Over-the-air testing (OTA) of wireless devices in realistic but repeatable environments is typically performed using either an expensive multi-antenna OTA chamber that provides a high level of multipath control or a low-cost mode-stirred reverberation chamber that offers limited multi path control. We introduce a reconfigurable OTA chamber whose walls are lined with antennas, a few of which may be attached to a channel emulator and the balance of which are connected to reconfigurable impedances. Initial simulations and measurements with this topology demonstrate that through control of the impedances and the port excitations, the chamber offers significant control over the achieved fading distribution, spatial correlation, and power angular spectrum at the device under test.", "Three-dimensional (3D) sensing and printing technologies have reshaped our world in recent years.

In addition, we demonstrate several devices, software, and experimental results of our related projects to further elaborate details of this process. A case study is conducted to further illustrate the possible tradeoffs during the process of this pipeline. Current progress, future research trends, and potential risks of 3D technologies are also discussed.", "Currently used procedures in room acoustics measurements are not automated. Particularly in medium-sized and large areas they require a lot of time and intensive labour which directly translates into an increase in the measurement cost. Introduction of an automated system would increase efficiency of the measurements, and therefore could present both practical and scientific benefit. The paper presents initial feasibility study for designing a system that permits the measurement of selected acoustic parameters for any choice of three-dimensional grid of measurement points throughout the volume of the room. The system will utilize an autonomous probe attached to a blimp, and will be able to measure and analyze acoustic characteristics of the rooms.

In particular, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) many-core architectures have been adopted for multimedia and signal processing applications with massive amounts of data parallelism where both performance and flexible programmability are important metrics. However, this class of processors has faced many challenges due to its increasing fabrication cost and design complexity. Moreover, the increasing gap between design productivity and chip complexity requires new design methods. Nowadays, the recent evolution of silicon integration technology, on the one hand, and the wide usage of reusable Intellectual Property (IP) cores and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), on the other hand, are attractive solutions to meet these challenges and reduce the time-to-market. The objective of this work is to study the performances of massively parallel SIMD on-chip architectures with current design methodologies based on recent integration technologies. Flexibility offered by these new design tools allows design space exploration to search for the most effective implementations. This work introduces an IP-based design methodology for easy building configurable and flexible massively parallel SIMD processing on FPGA platforms. The proposed approach allows implementing a generic parallel architecture based on IP assembly that can be tailored in order to better satisfy the requirements of highly-demanding applications.

Smartphones are equipped with various hardware and software resources such as Bluetooth, camera and gravity sensors. If these resources are not managed appropriately, it may cause severe problems such as battery drains and system crashes. However, the specifications of resource management are usually implicit. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining resource management specifications from off-the-shelf apps. Our key insight is that if a set of operations to a resource are frequently performed in a specific order, it must contain the specifications of how to manage the resource. We design a tool named Automatic Resource Specification Miner (ARSM), to automatically extract resource management specifications in smartphones. In our experiments, ARSM can mine tens of rules from 100 top rated Android apps within six hours. Our work is orthogonal to existing studies on diagnosing smartphone apps. With the resource management specifications discovered, ARSM can help them pinpoint more bugs in apps.", "Photothermal therapy is an effective means to induce tumor cell death, since tumor tissue is more sensitive to temperature increases than normal tissue. Biological responses depend on tissue temperature; target tissue temperature needs to be precisely measured and controlled to achieve desired thermal effects. In this work, a unique photoacoustic (PA) sensor is proposed for temperature measurement during interstitial laser phototherapy. A continuous-wave laser light and a pulsed laser light, for photothermal irradiation and photoacoustic temperature measurement, respectively, were delivered to the target tissue through a fiber coupler. During laser irradiation, the PA amplitude was measured. The Gruneisen parameter and the bioheat equation were used to determine the temperature in strategic positions in the target tissue. Our results demonstrate that the interstitial PA amplitude is a linear function of temperature in the range of 22 to 55 degrees C, as confirmed by thermocouple measurement. Furthermore, by choosing appropriate laser parameters, the maximum temperature surrounding the active diffuse fiber tip in tissue can be controlled in the range of 41 to 55 degrees C. Thus, this sensor could potentially be used for fast, accurate, and convenient three-dimensional temperature measurement, and for real-time feedback and control of interstitial laser phototherapy in cancer treatment.", "Side channels remain a challenge to information flow control and security in modern computing platforms. Resource partitioning techniques that minimise the number of shared resources among processes are often used to address this challenge. In this work, we focus on multi core platforms and we demonstrate that even seemingly strong isolation techniques based on dedicated cores can be circumvented through the use of thermal channels. Specifically, we show that the processor core temperature can be used both as a side channel as well as a covert communication channel even when the system implements strong spatial and temporal partitioning. Our experiments on an Intel Xeon server platform demonstrate covert thermal channels that achieve up to 12.5 bps and weak thermal side channels that can detect processes executed on neighbouring cores. This work therefore shows a limitation in the isolation that can be achieved on existing multi-core systems.", "This paper presents design and implementation of a drift-free orientation tracker for head-mounted displays. The sensor consists of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyro, and a 3-axis magnetometer. A digital motion processor is also used. To remove gyro drifts in the long run, a sensor fusion method is applied that combines accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer data. Before this data fusion, bias removal of accelerometer and calibration of magnetometer are carried out. The results of this sensor fusion are given to a virtual camera for real-time graphical rendering of the virtual environment. This program shows updates virtual images of the head-mounted display with 33 frames per second. The results show that the drift of gyro is reduced to less than 1.0 degrees over 3 minutes.", ["Ocean acidification (OA) is widely recognized as a significant oceanic threat in connection with other oceanic stressors, including warming and deoxygenation. Recent work shows that ocean acidification will negatively affect calcification processes for many species, including reef-building corals. It is possible that OA may cause diminished fish respiratory stress and impact sensory capabilities. To date most all of these scientific findings are from short-term experiments in laboratory aquaria on limited sets of organisms. The question posed, how can scientists perform long-term in situ CO2 experiments like those performed on land as part of the Free CO2 Air Enrichment (FACE) experiments? The desire is for experiments that can confirm conclusions drawn from laboratory experiments.", "The goal of FOCE (Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment) technology is to provide precise in situ control of pH within experimental chambers at a variety of environmental sites. This goal extends to include minimal effect on other environmental experimental conditions while supporting evaluation of the consequences of ocean acidification on marine organisms and communities. The techniques for chemical and physical control of CO2 chemistry are well understood, however they heavily depend on the marine environments of interest. The techniques and application technologies used to execute FOCE required considerable time to develop while building expertise that allows transfer to new environmental situations. MBARI has now put FOCE together in an open source package of technology and expertise in a product called xFOCE. xFOCE shows how FOCE techniques cost-effective and adaptable, reduce the learning curve and make it a useful tool for multi-disciplinary Ocean Acidification (OA) studies in any marine environment. xFOCE includes the idea of community building just as other open technology projects do to enable OA researchers. xFOCE gives baseline references designs on the use of FOCE tools and techniques by collating contributing expertise and technical support form the OA community currently using the xFOCE concept.", "In this presentation we show how the process of underwater technology started and developed into an open source project. Each step is directly related to a science input which formed and molded the FOCE idea into xFOCE. The discussion further shows how this has taken technical ideas and modified them into new areas as well as reduced overall costs. In conclusion, we cover the various systems that have been deployed and current multi-stressor systems in development as xFOCE expands capabilities and contributes to society understanding OA."], "In this paper, we propose a nonlinear controller that stabilizes unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-denied environments with respect to visual targets by using only onboard sensing. The translational velocity of the vehicle is estimated online with a nonlinear observer, which exploits spherical visual features as the main source of information. With the proposed solution, only four visual features have shown to be enough for the observer to operate in a real scenario. In addition, the observer is computationally light with constant numerical complexity, involving small-dimension matrices. The observer output is then exploited in a nonlinear controller designed with an integral backstepping approach, thus yielding a novel robust control system. By means of Lyapunov analysis, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. Extensive simulation and experimental tests with a quadrotor are carried out to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed approach. The control system runs fully onboard on a standard processor, and only a low-cost sensing suite is employed. Tracking of a target whose speed exceeds 2m/s is also considered in the real-hardware experiments.", "Recent developments in human-robot interaction show how the ability to communicate with people in a natural way is of great importance for artificial agents. The implementation of facial expressions has been found to significantly increase the interaction capabilities of humanoid robots. For speech, displaying a correct articulation with sound is mandatory to avoid audiovisual illusions like the McGurk effect (leading to comprehension errors) as well as to enhance the intelligibility in noisy conditions. This work describes the design, construction and testing of an animatronic talking face developed for the iCub robot. This talking head has an articulated jaw and four independent lip movements actuated by five motors. It is covered by a specially designed elastic tissue cover whose hemlines at the lips are attached to the motors via connecting linkages. The mechanical design and the control scheme have been evaluated by speech intelligibility in noise (SPIN) perceptual tests that demonstrate an absolute 10% intelligibility gain provided by the jaw and lip movements over the audio-only display.", "Open architectures like the one recently unveiled by Facebook allow a detailed assessment of the energy efficiency of commercial data centers. This paper explores the fit of Zipf-like distributions typical of network traffic, to updates of user pages and the entity graph, for the new Facebook data center network architecture. We find that network resource consumption could be reduced by as much as 40-50% through several changes, either to the software, or to the data center design. Of these, employing a connected hub-and-spoke subgraph representation for each popular node, with each pod operating locally on its node of the subgraph, appears to hold the most energy savings potential. This work is part of a larger effort to more completely characterize the efficiency of data center computer- and network architectures beyond the normal reporting of facility power utilization efficiency (PUE), which is blind to energy proportionality and other aspects of the efficiency within the computer- and network architecture, or IT portion, of the data center.", "In this work, we examine the IO characteristics of two smartphone platforms: Android and Tizen. We compare how the two platforms differ in using the filesystem, using the database, and accessing the storage. We collected the IOs from select seven different apps that are commonly available on both platforms. By analyzing the collected the IOs on both platforms, a dominant fraction of writes are 4 KB synchronous. On Android and Tizen, respectively, 65% and 45% of all write IO counts 4 KB; 47% and 75% of all writes accesses are SQLite related files such as database, rollback journal, WAL (Write Ahead Log), and etc.; 81% and 86% of all IOs are random accesses; and 90% and 52% of all writes counts are synchronous IO mode. According to our IO analysis, Android IO stack is more sophisticated then Tizen one: (i) disables atime updates, (ii) adopts journal asynchronous commit, and (iii) adopts fdatasync() in SQLite.", "The assessment of in-space objects is an area of ongoing research. Characterization of resident space objects (RSOs) can be useful for assessing the operating status of operator-affiliated or non-affiliated space assets, identifying unknown objects or gathering additional details for known objects. Under the proposed approach, a ring-like constellation of CubeSats passes around the target (at a distance) collecting imagery. This imagery is then utilized to create a 3D model of the target. This paper considers several key elements of a constellation to perform this type of imaging, including the constellation design and imaging capabilities required and the astrodynamics relevant to maintaining formation. A discussion of the impact of the locations of the lighting sources is presented and the utility of this data for a variety of applications is assessed. Analysis of simulated test data is discussed.", "This paper focuses on the research and practice of digital social innovation (DSI). The rapid progress in the era of information provides many possibilities for social innovation. At the meanwhile, the development of science and technology has significantly boosted the breadth, depth and efficiency of social innovation. Through years' of research and practice, we improve the definition and conclude the features of DSI from a large number of case studies. Then, by combining the SET factors, we develop the general standard framework for DSI. At last, we use and confirm the righteous and effectiveness of this instruction in practice.", "This half day course introduces the field of musical interface design and implementation. Participants will learn and practice key aspects of the theory and practice of designing original interactive music technology with case studies including augmented and sensor based instruments, audio-visual instruments, mobile, and networked music making. Digital technologies offer powerful opportunities for the creation and manipulation of sound, however the flexibility of these technologies implies a confusing array of choices for musical composers and performers. Some artists have faced this challenge by using computers directly to create new musical forms. However, most would agree the computer is not a musical instrument, in the same sense as traditional instruments, and it is natural to ask 'how to play the computer' in a way appropriate to human brains and bodies. To attempt to answer this question in the course, we draw from the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) [1,2], which began as a workshop of CHI 2001 [3] and explore connections with the established field of human-computer interaction.", "The ARINC 653 specification defines a standard functional interface and temporal requirements for Operating Systems (OSs) used in aviation systems, and is based on temporally and spatially isolated partitions in which the application processes are executed. In this paper we present the key lessons learned from the development of an ARINC 653 compatible OS with educational and experimental purposes for BeagleBone, a popular and low-cost hardware platform.", "The direction of sunshine or the installation sites of environmental control facilities in the greenhouse result in different temperature and humidity levels in the various zones of the greenhouse, and thus, the production quality of crop is inconsistent. This study proposed a wireless-networked decentralized fuzzy control scheme to regulate the environmental parameters of various culture zones within a greenhouse. The proposed scheme can create different environmental conditions for cultivating different crops in various zones and achieve diversification or standardization of crop production. A star-type wireless sensor network is utilized to communicate with each sensing node, actuator node, and control node in various zones within the greenhouse. The fuzzy rule-based inference system is used to regulate the environmental parameters for temperature and humidity based on real-time data of plant growth response provided by a growth stage selector. The growth stage selector defines the control ranges of temperature and humidity of the various culture zones according to the leaf area of the plant, the number of leaves, and the cumulative amount of light. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is stable and robust and provides basis for future greenhouse applications.", "In the Czech Republic there is an on-going debate and for the last year also legislative work on a Revenue Registry Act. This article introduces the system of revenue registry which should be applied in the Czech Republic, critically analyses fundamental provisions of the draft bill and summarizes advantages and disadvantages of the regulation and its strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Article deals with a hypothesis that implementation of revenue registry will fulfil the goals of the proposed regulation i.e. new source of data for tax administration, restriction of grey economy, more efficient tax collection, especially of income tax and VAT and also elimination of market inequalities in the Czech economy.", "This paper presents a hand gestural interaction system that is used to handle a Desktop Haptic Strip for Shape Rendering (DHSSR). The strip is a physical display of virtual curves intersecting 3D virtual objects, and aims at allowing designers to evaluate the quality of shapes during the conceptual design phase of new products. The DHSSR consists of a servo-actuated developable metallic strip, which reproduces cross-sectional curves of 3D virtual objects. In order to generate the virtual curve intersecting the virtual object it has been implemented a hand gestural interaction system, which allows moving the curve or the 3D object. Specifically, through an interaction approach based on a magnetic pinch the user can move the virtual strip until reaching the desired position. Instead, an interaction modality based on index finger recognition allows moving the 3D object while the virtual curve is floating in space. The virtual curve generated by the interaction is used for deforming the physical strip. The hand gestural interaction system has been implemented by using low cost and open technologies, and combines an engine for interactive 3D content generation (Unity 3D), a motion capture sensor (LeapMotion) and the Arduino Leonardo board. In particular, the user's hands are tracked by means of the Leap Motion sensor. The Unity 3D environment is used to virtually render the virtual objects (curve and shape) and the virtual avatar of the users' hands. The virtual environment is connected with the Arduino Leonardo board in order to control the six servo-actuators of the DHSSR. The paper also presents some studies performed to evaluate the performances of the DHSSR system and the usability of the hand gestural interaction modalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "In this study, a miniature artificial compound eye (15 mm in diameter) called the curved artificial compound eye (CurvACE) was endowed for the first time with hyperacuity, using similar micro-movements to those occurring in the fly's compound eye. A periodic micro-scanning movement of only a few degrees enables the vibrating compound eye to locate contrasting objects with a 40-fold greater resolution than that imposed by the interommatidial angle. In this study, we developed a new algorithm merging the output of 35 local processing units consisting of adjacent pairs of artificial ommatidia. The local measurements performed by each pair are processed in parallel with very few computational resources, which makes it possible to reach a high refresh rate of 500 Hz. An aerial robotic platform with two degrees of freedom equipped with the active CurvACE placed over naturally textured panels was able to assess its linear position accurately with respect to the environment thanks to its efficient gaze stabilization system. The algorithm was found to perform robustly at different light conditions as well as distance variations relative to the ground and featured small closed-loop positioning errors of the robot in the range of 45 mm. In addition, three tasks of interest were performed without having to change the algorithm: short-range odometry, visual stabilization, and tracking contrasting objects (hands) moving over a textured background.", "Microorganisms act both as drivers and indicators of perturbations in the marine environment. In an effort to establish baselines to predict the response of marine habitats to environmental change, here we report a broad survey of microbial diversity across the Indian Ocean, including the first microbial samples collected in the pristine lagoon of Salomon Islands, Chagos Archipelago. This was the first largescale ecogenomic survey aboard a private yacht employing a 'citizen oceanography' approach and tools and protocols easily adapted to ocean going sailboats. Our data highlighted biogeographic patterns in microbial community composition across the Indian Ocean. Samples from within the Salomon Islands lagoon contained a community which was different even from adjacent samples despite constant water exchange, driven by the dominance of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechococcus. In the lagoon, Synechococcus was also responsible for driving shifts in the metatranscriptional profiles. Enrichment of transcripts related to photosynthesis and nutrient cycling indicated bottom-up controls of community structure. However a five-fold increase in viral transcripts within the lagoon during the day, suggested a concomitant top-down control by bacteriophages. Indeed, genome recruitment against Synechococcus reference genomes suggested a role of viruses in providing the ecological filter for determining the beta-diversity patterns in this system.", "The role of social innovations in transforming the lives of individuals and communities has been a source of popular attention in recent years. This article systematically reviews the available evidence of the relationship between social innovation and its promotion of health equity. Guided by Fair Foundations: The VicHealth framework for health equity and examining four types of social innovation-social movements, service-related social innovations, social enterprise and digital social innovations-we find a growing literature on social innovation activities, but inconsistent evaluative evidence of their impacts on health equities, particularly at the socio-economic, political and cultural level of the framework. Distinctive characteristics of social innovations related to the promotion of health equity include the mobilization of latent or unrealised value through new combinations of (social, cultural and material) resources; growing bridging social capital and purposeful approaches to linking individual knowledge and experience to institutional change. These have implications for health promotion practice and for research about social innovation and health equity.", "This paper proposes a new software composition method for automated machines that exploits their mechatronic modularity. It is demonstrated that desired behavior of a certain class of machines can be composed of behaviors of its mechatronic components, including fully decentralized scheduling and operation control. This aims at increased performance of software design and maintenance, as well as systems' flexibility and reconfigurability. The IEC 61499 Function Blocks' (FBs) architecture is used as an implementation platform that enables system-level simulation and transparency of deployment. A configurable pick-and-place (PnP) manipulator with decentralized control synthesized using the proposed approach is chosen as an illustrative example.", "This paper presents the design of a smart geyser controller that can relay information between two functional units making use of low power IEEE 802.15.4 radios, with the objective of lowering the power consumption of a household geyser. The first operational unit measures the environmental data of the geyser, i. e. water temperature, voltage, current and power measurements, and also switches the geyser on and off. The other functional unit is used to display information to the user and also connects to a PC where environmental data is stored in a local database for historical review. This database is used to create a priority time table, which forms the basis of the operational optimization algorithm.", "This paper introduces a novel algorithm to obtain attitude estimations from low cost inertial measurement units including 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. This nonlinear attitude estimator is derived from Lyapunov's theory and formulated in the special orthogonal group SO(3). The impact of the gyroscope bias is also assessed and an online estimator provided. The performance of the proposed estimator is validated and compared to current commonly used methods, namely the classical extended Kalman filter and two other nonlinear estimators in SO(3). Realistic simulations consider a quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicle subject to wind disturbances and whose sensors parameters have been identified from flight tests data.", "The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) facilitates high-affinity presynaptic DA reuptake that temporally and spatially constrains DA neurotransmission. Aberrant DAT function is implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. DAT is a major psychostimulant target, and psychostimulant reward strictly requires binding to DAT. DAT function is acutely modulated by dynamic membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and a PKC-sensitive negative endocytic mechanism, or \"endocytic brake,\" controls DAT plasma membrane stability. However, the molecular basis for the DAT endocytic brake is unknown, and it is unknown whether this braking mechanism is unique to DAT or common to monoamine transporters. Here, we report that the cdc42-activated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1, is a DAT endocytic brake that stabilizes DAT at the plasma membrane and is released in response to PKC activation. Pharmacologic and shRNA-mediated Ack1 silencing enhanced basal DAT internalization and blocked PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, but had no effects on SERT endocytosis. Both cdc42 activation and PKC stimulation converge on Ack1 to control Ack1 activity and DAT endocytic capacity, and Ack1 inactivation is required for stimulated DAT internalization downstream of PKC activation. Moreover, constitutive Ack1 activation is sufficient to rescue the gain-of-function endocytic phenotype exhibited by the ADHD DAT coding variant, R615C. These findings reveal a unique endocytic control switch that is highly specific for DAT. Moreover, the ability to rescue the DAT(R615C) coding variant suggests that manipulating DAT trafficking mechanisms may be a potential therapeutic approach to correct DAT coding variants that exhibit trafficking dysregulation.", "Channel measurements are the prerequisite condition for the design of the next-generation high-speed railway (HSR) communication system. Because of the measurement restriction and measurement efficiency issues of applying conventional channel sounders in HSR scenarios, railway-network-based channel measurements are becoming quite attractive. In this paper, a method that employs the cell-specific reference signal in long-term-evolution (LTE) railway networks as the excitation signal to perform HSR channel measurements is presented. This method is implemented by a novel channel measurement system composed of existing LTE railway networks and a dedicated LTE receiver, which can efficiently collect the time-frequency-space channel data and is able to measure different communication links simultaneously. Based on this system, field measurements that consider both direct coverage and relay coverage schemes are conducted on the Beijing-to-Tianjin HSR in China. Statistical results, involving path loss, Ricean K-factor, root-mean-square delay spread, single-link spatial correlation (SC), and multilink SC, are derived, which not only confirm the viability of the proposed method but also provide realistic HSR channel characteristics for the research on future HSR communications.", "A reconfigurable chamber for over the air testing of wireless devices has recently been introduced, with potential performance examined through simulation. This paper reports an experimental prototype of such a chamber. Measurements using a circular array explore the angular characteristics of the multipath fields that can be synthesized in the chamber.", "During this decade, Wireless Sensor Networks received an increasing amount of attention from the industrial and research world. One of their applications is the indoor localization of nodes. A distance evaluation mechanism between nodes, called ranging, is required to precisely determine the nodes' positions. The research work presented in this article relates to this topic and aims to use Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radio links to achieve an efficient ranging. For localization to be cost effective and useful from an application point of view, ranging must be integrated into the usual network traffic (data, beacons, acknowledgements, etc.). However, ranging calls for time-constrained communications. Using existing messages implies spreading the data collection over time, thus making the impact of the clocks' respective drifts noticeable. This leads to a significant imprecision of the measurement of Time of Flight (ToF) and therefore distance. To correct these errors, we have introduced original techniques of dynamic algorithmic corrections to eliminate these inaccuracies. One solution is proposed and evaluated through real prototyping. The results show an accuracy of twenty centimetres, which is better than most solutions found in the literature. This correction enables precise ranging even on delayed exchanges; this last point suggests that the integration of ranging in usual network traffic is possible.", "Over the past decade, CMOS scaling has seen increasingly intrusive challenges from cost, variability, energy, reliability, and fundamental device-architectural and materials limitations. To maintain Moore's-Law scaling of integration value, the industry is urgently exploring beyond-silicon and beyond-CMOS device, interconnect and memory options, as well as heterogeneous, \"More than Moore\" integration and packaging technologies. This coincides with a turning point for the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field, which has for 50+ years been a key enabler of the semiconductor industry's amazing growth. Maturation of the EDA industry and its related academic research efforts inevitably result in a spiral of declining valuations (multiples), venture capital investments, research funding, and student interest. To counter this trajectory, the EDA field's business models, research portfolios, and funding models have been going through various diversifications, but in a rather ad-hoc manner. This begs the question of how the paradigms and research methodologies of EDA can be leveraged for design automation (DA) in other, emerging domains. Arguably, more efficient evolution and growth as a community requires a more systematic, coherent effort - as well as forward-looking vision - to steer by. In this paper, we review initial efforts of a new IEEE CEDA technical activity group dedicated to this purpose. These efforts span the cataloguing of past and current research trends, development of new metrics of research impact, and visions for future applications of EDA paradigms in broader design automation contexts. It is hoped that these efforts will be useful to the EDA community as it continues to evolve beyond its \"E-roots\".", "This paper introduces the design and practical validation of a quaternion control scheme to globally stabilize a quadrotor aerial vehicle. First an attitude control law is proposed to stabilize the vehicle's heading, then a position control law is developed to stabilize the vehicle around a desired point. Using position references, a smooth trajectory is calculated for the attitude controller such that the position of the vehicle becomes stable. The proposed control algorithm allows a linear quadrotor system's behavior. The closed-loop system is then numerically simulated to corroborate stability.", "The authors model the user innovation networks of NASA's International Space Apps Challenges and use social network analysis to empirically investigate the existence and impact of three drivers of innovation. These drivers are competition, social interaction, and network vitality. We empirically prove that competitive intensity exists as a driver of innovation in our networks, and is an indicator of innovation success, while the drivers of social interaction intensity and network vitality do not.

On the one hand it considers the external approach, that is, the analysis of visible signals linked to the emerging issues that in an early stage are called \"weak signals\". On the other hand, it tries to study emerging issues taking into account their internal motivations. In this case the aim is to value the social, economic or other kind of reasons that are hidden under emerging issues. A post-structuralism perspective (CIA, causal layered analysis) is used to address this objective.", "This double approach allows to consider emerging issues in a holistic way, taking into account what is visible and what is not so apparent.

Released in early 2012 by the artist groups F.A.T. and Sy-lab, the Free Universal Construction Kit is a set of 3D drawings that enable everyone with access to a 3D printer to make connectors between intellectual property restricted toys like LEGO, Tinkertoys, and Fischertechnik. However, when describing this project as \"reverse engineering as a civic activity\", it becomes obvious that the Kit's greater agenda is not just to enable cross-over playing, but rather, to problematize and perhaps ultimately open up closed formats through critical appropriation. But how does that, for instance, conform with the fact that the connectors are parasitically attached to these toys, whose logic it is simultaneously defying? And which ( implicit) notions of creativity and play are at stake in this project, and to what extent do they fit the more general philosophical underpinnings of this project?", "Video surveillance is an essential tool for many security-related applications but video is also increasingly used in combination with computer vision technologies in other sensing applications. With the growth of installed camera infrastructure and development it would be beneficial to enable video surveillance systems to support many application simultaneously. Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) is a prospective solution to implement such a multi-application surveillance system, which can provide video data and processing methods to different applications based on their requirements. However, such a system presents several challenges, which needs to be addressed and considered along with the constrains on the system resources.

With an increase in the deployment of smart objects, IoT is expected to have a significant impact on human life in the near future. A major breakthrough in bridging the gap between virtual and physical worlds came from the vision of the Web of Things (WoT), which employs open Web standards in achieving information sharing and objects interoperability.

Dahlander and Wallin (2006) have shown that firms deploy their personnel, the so-called man on the inside (MOI), to participate in open source communities in order to unlock the valuable assets that are voluntarily being created in these communities. Focusing on firm-sponsored open source communities, we will detect the functions of MOI and how these individuals influence the community by applying a comparative case study of two open source software firms, which includes interviews with managers and MOI, nemographic and social network analysis of the community interactions of over 12,000 individuals. We conclude that despite the fiery situation of combining open source philosophy with a firm's profit-driven business model, firms can succeed in integrating a community into the firm's development process with the help of the Mat.

While technology exists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-based applications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools. Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very few existing and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution to developers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integrated model-driven development environment that addresses all phases of application lifecycle including design, development, verification, analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, with supporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such a model-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, this paper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMS ML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specific sub-languages. We claim that the language promotes \"correct-by-construction\" software development and integration by supporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using a case study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts the development of embedded systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The photodiode pixel array can not only capture images but also harvest solar energy. As such, the CMOS image sensor chip is able to switch between imaging and harvesting modes towards self-power operation. Moreover, an on-chip maximum power point tracking (MPPT)-based power management system (PMS) is designed for the dual-mode image sensor to further improve the energy efficiency. A new isolated P-well energy harvesting and imaging (EHI) pixel with very high fill factor is introduced. Several ultra-low power design techniques such as reset and select boosting techniques have been utilized to maintain a wide pixel dynamic range. The chip was designed and fabricated in a 1.8 V, 1P6M 0.18 mu m CMOS process. Total power consumption of the imager is 6.53 mu W for a 96 x 96 pixel array with 1 V supply and 5 fps frame rate.

The dynamic network topology, the temporal and spatial variations in spectrum availability, and the distributed multi-hop architecture of CRAHNs mandate novel solutions to achieve time synchronization and efficiently support spectrum sensing, access, decision and mobility. In this article, we advance this research agenda by proposing the novel Bio-inspired time SynChronization protocol for CRAHNs (BSynC). The protocol draws on the spontaneous firefly synchronization observed in parts of Southeast Asia. The significance of BSynC lies in its capability of promoting symmetric time synchronization between pairs of network nodes independent of the network topology or a predefined sequence for synchronization. It enables the nodes in CRAHNs to efficiently synchronize in a decentralized manner, and it is also reliable to changes, faults and attacks.

It represents an inner periphery and inner colony of Austrian and European capitalism. This article analyses the political economy of the Internet in the Waldviertel. The Waldviertel is confronted with high rates of exploitation within the context of an imperialist division of labour, with transfer of value, unequal exchange, low wages, the exodus of the textile industry, high unemployment, depopulation of the countryside, a dismantling of public infrastructure, and a declining population. This analysis makes clear that the reality of the Waldviertel as inner periphery of the capitalist centres shapes communication in the region. Access to computers, the Internet and broadband is worse in the Waldviertel than in other regions. Internet and mobile speeds tend to be slower, making the region less attractive to information workers. There are also signs of an alternative economy in the Waldviertel that call imperialism into question. In the area of the information economy there is potential for founding socialist co-operatives for hardware, software, and social media that call the capitalist information society into question and struggle for alternatives.", "This work proposes the design of Environmental Sensor Networks (ESN) through balancing robustness and redundancy. An Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is employed to find the optimal placement of sensor nodes in the Region of Interest (RoI). Data quality issues are introduced to simulate their impact on the performance of the ESN. Spatial Regression Test (SRT) is also utilised to promote robustness in data quality of the designed ESN. The proposed method provides high network representativeness (fit for purpose) with minimum sensor redundancy (cost), and ensures robustness by enabling the network to continue to achieve its objectives when some sensors fail.", "This paper presents the design of quadrotor control architecture, based on crowd-sourcing electronics. The aim of this quadrotor is to provide a test-bed for vision-based autonomous navigation system in GPS denied environments. The control architecture consists of a cascaded structure, where an attitude controller nested in velocity and altitude controllers. The sub-controllers are all linear controllers with feedforward term to linearize the quadrotor dynamics. The control and sensor fusion algorithm is developed under Arduino compatible open source electronics, whereas the complete design also includes an additional downward facing optical flow sensor (PX4FLOW camera) for horizontal velocity estimation and vehicle altitude estimation, and a separate Linux embedded computer (Odriod-U3) for future Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) vision algorithm development. In current stage, by utilizing the PX4FLOW sensor, it is capable of horizontal velocity control and altitude hold. Besides, a ground station GUI software is developed in MATLAB (R) for two-way telemetry visualization and in-air parameter tuning.", "In this paper, a nano quadrotor helicopter which weighs about only 45 grams and has a diameter less than 0.15 m is employed for the autonomous flight control development in GPS-denied environments. Due to the very limited payload ability of the helicopter, a micro onboard vision system is designed to provide visual pose measurement. Then the attitude data obtained from a low cost micro inertial measurement unit (IMU) are fused with the visual measurement to provide accurate estimation of the helicopter's translational position and velocity. Nonlinear flight controller is designed to hold the quadrotor in a certain position and altitude without external ground motion capture system. Moreover, trajectory tracking ability is achieved with the help of a modified visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the good hovering and tracking control performance of the proposed design in GPS-denied indoor and outdoor environments. To our best knowledge, few of previous works have demonstrated autonomous control ability of a quadrotor helicopter weighs less than 50 grams without the help of external ground motion capture system in GPS-denied indoor and outdoor environments.", null, "The demand for increased bandwidth to support modern mobile wireless services has pushed the community to explore higher carrier frequencies where spectrum is more readily available. However, relatively few studies have focused attention on bands such as 24 GHz that may support non-line-of-sight communication.

Upgrading a single component may not be enough. It is necessary to take each component and apply the best possible techniques to upgrade the system. This paper looks at the configurations necessary for a medical based WSN with particular focus on clustering and routing. It includes an implementation of a WSN architecture in Contiki operating system using Tmote Sky and openmote technologies. The underlying power consumption related to this architecture is analysed and real world measurements are presented. Finally, the case of a modified secure routing algorithm is introduced with simulation based results showing single and collaborative selective forwarding detection/correction, and network latency. Additionally, a solution to the problem of malicious nodes dropping control messages has been provided. The uniqueness of the paper resides in the implementation of monitoring mechanism without any watchdog nodes. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this mechanism has not been implemented on the Contiki OS.", "Accurate localization of mobile nodes has been an important and fundamental problem in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). The detection information returned from a mobile node is meaningful only if its location is known. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms based on color filtering technology called PCFL and ACFL. PCFL and ACFL aim at collaboratively accomplishing accurate localization of underwater mobile nodes with minimum energy expenditure. They both adopt the overlapping signal region of task anchors which can communicate with the mobile node directly as the current sampling area. PCFL employs the projected distances between each of the task projections and the mobile node, while ACFL adopts the direct distance between each of the task anchors and the mobile node. The proportion factor of distance is also proposed to weight the RGB values. By comparing the nearness degrees of the RGB sequences between the samples and the mobile node, samples can be filtered out. The normalized nearness degrees are considered as the weighted standards to calculate the coordinates of the mobile nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed methods have excellent localization performance and can localize the mobile node in a timely way. The average localization error of PCFL is decreased by about 30.4% compared to the AFLA method.", "Distributed transmission rate tuning is important for a wide variety of IEEE 802.15.4 network applications such as industrial network control systems. Such systems often require each node to sustain certain throughput demand in order to guarantee the system performance. It is thus essential to determine a proper transmission rate that can meet the application requirement and compensate for network imperfections (e.g., packet loss). Such a tuning in a heterogeneous network is difficult due to the lack of modeling techniques that can deal with the heterogeneity of the network as well as the network traffic changes. In this paper, a distributed transmission rate tuning algorithm in a heterogeneous IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA network is proposed. Each node uses the results of clear channel assessment (CCA) to estimate the busy channel probability. Then a mathematical framework is developed to estimate the on-going heterogeneous traffics using the busy channel probability at runtime. Finally a distributed algorithm is derived to tune the transmission rate of each node to accurately meet the throughput requirement. The algorithm does not require modifications on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer and it has been experimentally implemented and extensively tested using TelosB nodes with the TinyOS protocol stack. The results reveal that the algorithm is accurate and can satisfy the throughput demand. Compared with existing techniques, the algorithm is fully distributed and thus does not require any central coordination. With this property, it is able to adapt to traffic changes and re-adjust the transmission rate to the desired level, which cannot be achieved using the traditional modeling techniques.", "Secure information aggregation using homomorphic encryption in wireless sensor networks allows data to be aggregated without having to decrypt the packets. While data aggregation provides a means to reduce network traffic, homomorphic encryption increases the size of the packets and this could negatively affect system performance. This is because energy consumption of the nodes is directly proportional to the amount of data transferred. In this paper, the effect of this increased packet size was investigated for the Domingo-Ferrer encryption scheme and compared to a symmetric encryption scheme. It was found that the symmetric encryption scheme outperforms the homomorphic encryption scheme for smaller networks, but as the network size grows, homomorphic encryption starts outperforming symmetric encryption. It was also found that the homomorphic encryption scheme does not significantly reduce the performance of plaintext aggregation.", "We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry. Here we describe the implementation and performance of the method on a hovering robot equipped with eight 0.65 g optic-flow sensors, and show that it can be used for closed-loop control of various motions.", "This paper presents a collaborative formation holding that translates and rotates an oversized object to a predefined reference location, utilizing a swarm of robots.

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet.

Recent advances in open-source software and hardware technologies, such as the Arduino project, show potential for the development of low-cost (similar to$100) automated dataloggers required for continuous data collection. We developed an Arduino-based datalogger (the Ecohydro Logger) coupled with water sensors providing digital output to establish a hydrologic monitoring network in the data-scarce wet-dry tropics of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. While we experienced some challenges with a first iteration of our Arduinobased datalogger, an improved version was robust and able to capture long periods of high-frequency stream discharge data. Integration of the monitoring program into the local community was also key to successful deployment, allowing exchange of local knowledge and support. The accessible and low-cost nature of Arduino-based dataloggers can provide a means to extend continuous environmental monitoring into data-scarce regions.", "Modern industry requires an improved motor performance and the permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motors are especially appropriate for applications that require a high level of accuracy and performance. The advanced control strategies when applied into BLDC motor drive systems may further enhance their performance. However, these methods are relatively complex and computationally intensive, which may hamper the implementation. Fuzzy logic control algorithm has been developed in this investigation and embedded into a commercially available motion control system for the position control of BLDC motors. BLDC motor drives offered by PicoMotion Inc. and Motion Control Framework software platform have been selected for the experiments due to their compactness, flexibility and the open hardware and software concept they have been created upon. The obtained comparative results with respect to the built in PI control law have confirmed that the implementation of more advanced control strategies on inexpensive hardware and software platforms, nowadays available on the market for the control of BLDC motors, can be practically feasible and can enhance their performance.", "Since twenty years, young researchers form the Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, organize two times a year, under only a marginal supervision of the senior faculty members, under the patronage of WEiTI PW, KEiT PAN, SPIE, IEEE, PKOpto SEP and PSF, the WILGA Symposium on advanced, integrated functional electronic, photonic and mechatronic systems [1-5].

It has transformed manufacturing across virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes convenient and affordable desktop 3D printers. These are being used in the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast.

It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (J&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them.", "The article describes the design phase, development and practical application of a smart object integrated in a desk lamp and called \"Smart Lamp\", useful to optimize the indoor thermal comfort and energy savings that are two important workplace issues where the comfort of the workers and the consumption of the building strongly affect the economic balance of a company. The Smart Lamp was built using a microcontroller, an integrated temperature and relative humidity sensor, some other modules and a 3D printer. This smart device is similar to the desk lamps that are usually found in offices but it allows one to adjust the indoor thermal comfort, by interacting directly with the air conditioner. After the construction phase, the Smart Lamp was installed in an office normally occupied by four workers to evaluate the indoor thermal comfort and the cooling consumption in summer. The results showed how the application of the Smart Lamp effectively reduced the energy consumption, optimizing the thermal comfort. The use of DIY approach combined with read-write functionality of websites, blog and social platforms, also allowed to customize, improve, share, reproduce and interconnect technologies so that anybody could use them in any occupied environment.", "Biologically inspired vision systems, such as convolutional networks, have begun to rival humans in some vision tasks. A key difference between such systems and the human visual system is that the latter dedicates most of its resources to a small fraction of the visual field (the fovea), which it moves frequently and rapidly to acquire a series of rich representations of small parts of a scene. We are developing an artificial system to approximate this aspect of human vision on a robot. The main components are a novel foveating lens, and a novel gimbal that can perform rapid and precise stereo camera orientation. This paper focuses on the gimbal design, which we are releasing under an open hardware license. We expect that it will serve as both an advanced robot vision system, and a source of further insight into human vision.", "The miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD.

In contrast, it is not standard to demonstrate optical scattering experiments on the undergraduate level beyond simple diffraction gratings. We present an inexpensive Mie scattering setup manufactured with 3D printing and open hardware. The experiment can be used to determine the particle size in dilute monodisperse colloidal suspensions with surprisingly high accuracy and is, thus, suitable to demonstrate relations between scattering measurements and microscopic properties of particles within undergraduate lab course projects.", "Having once been the headquarters of 'Made in China,' Shenzhen's industry is currently undergoing profound change. The appearance of new urban places for technological innovation is reviving the ageing industrial processes of this manufacturing city. It is supposed to transform Shenzhen into the Silicon Valley of hardware. Two groups, one local, the shanzhai community made up of entrepreneurs and companies historically based on a strategy of imitating highend products, and the other, a more international maker community, are thought to be the main drivers of this change using values of 'open innovation'. The building of this ecosystem relies largely on practices associated with being open-source. Like in California, open innovation contributed to the creation of resources for the development of a vast high-tech industry. This ethnographic field study shows how, while both communities, the international makers and the shanzhai, draw on open innovation, they do not have the same values. For the shanzhai, open innovation means total deregulation and a kind of coopetition that poorly masks fierce competition. For the makers, open innovation does not entirely eliminate the classic tension between 'open' and 'closed' commons in the world of makers. These two communities still rarely collaborate.", "The application of White Rabbit precision time protocol (WR-PTP) in long-distance optical fiber links has been investigated. WR-PTP is an implementation of PTP in synchronous Ethernet optical fiber networks, originally intended for synchronization of equipment within a range of 10 km. This paper discusses the results and limitations of two implementations of WR-PTP in the existing communication fiber networks. A 950-km WR-PTP link was realized using unidirectional paths in a fiber pair between Espoo and Kajaani, Finland. The time transfer on this link was compared (after initial calibration) against a clock comparison by GPS precise point positioning (PPP). The agreement between the two methods remained within +/- 2 ns over three months of measurements. Another WR-PTP implementation was realized between Delft and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, by cascading two links of 137 km each. In this case, the WR links were realized as bidirectional paths in single fibers. The measured time offset between the starting and end points of the link was within 5 ns with an uncertainty of 8 ns, mainly due to the estimated delay asymmetry caused by chromatic dispersion.", "The article describes the application of an object, called Smart lamp, for the control of the thermal comfort in real working conditions, implemented following the Do IT Yourself (DIY) approach, using a microcontroller, low cost sensors and a 3D printer. The idea beyond the Smart lamp is the concept of smart environments in which sensors and actuators interact each other with the aim of improving the human well-being. The device that upgrades in a \"smart\" way a commercial desk lamp usually available in offices, allows to optimize the indoor thermal comfort and the energy consumption, by interacting directly with the heat pump. In order to evaluate in a 4 -person office the thermal comfort and the energy consumption improvements due to the better management of the cooling system a Smart lamp was tested. The results showed how the application of this device effectively has optimized the thermal comfort and the energy consumption. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.", "During this decade, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) brought an increasing interest in the industrial and research world. One of their applications is indoor localization. The ranging, i.e. the distance evaluation mechanism between nodes, is required to determine the position of the nodes. The research work presented in this article aims to use Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radio links to achieve an efficient ranging, based on Time of Flight (ToF) measurement. A good solution consists in integrating ranging traffic into the usual network messages. However, the ToF ranging process is based on information exchanges which are temporally constrained. Once this information is encapsulated into the usual messages, the temporal constraint cannot be honoured, resulting in important ranging errors due to clock drifts. To mitigate these errors, we have introduced an original dynamic correction technique which enables a precision of twenty centimetres allowing the inclusion of ranging traffic in usual traffic.", "Redistributed manufacturing is an emerging concept which captures the anticipated reshoring and localisation of production from large scale mass manufacturing plants to smaller-scale localised, customisable production units, largely driven by new digital production technologies. Critically, community-based digital fabrication workshops, or makespaces, are anticipated to be one hothouse for this new era of localised production and as such are key to future sustainable design and manufacturing practices. In parallel, the concept of the circular economy conceptualises the move from a linear economy of take-make-waste to a closed loop system, through repair, remanufacturing, and recycling to ultimately extend the value of products and materials. Despite the clear interplay between redistributed manufacturing and circular economy, there is limited research exploring this relationship. In light of these interconnected developments, the aim of this paper is to explore the role of makespaces in contributing to a circular economy through redistributed manufacturing activities. This is achieved through six semi-structured interviews with thought leaders on these topics. The research findings identify barriers and opportunities to both circular economy and redistributed manufacturing, uncover overlaps between circular economy and redistributed manufacturing, and identify a range of future research directions that can support the coming together of these areas. The research contributes to a wider conversation on embedding circular practices within makespaces and their role in redistributed manufacturing.", "Digital native generations have been technology consumers all their life. Our children should be educated to be capable to contribute, as active producers, to the digital framework with a maturity and critical attitude. To do that children should learn to program from very early stage at school and combine this with electronics can be the right way to motivate them to develop skills such as reasoning, problems resolution, logic, creativity, perseverance and team work. This paper describes the development of an augmented reality book that can be used by children to learn programming and electronics. Students alone, in groups, at home or in the classroom can use mobile devices (smart-phones or tablets) and augmented reality to help them in the electronics assembly. We believe that the use of augmented reality will change significantly the teaching activities by enabling the addition of supplementary information that is seen on a mobile device.", "The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1.", "A smart helmet has been developed that is able to detect of hazardous events in the mines industry. In the development of helmet, we have considered the three main types of hazard such as air quality, helmet removal, and collision (miners are struck by an object). The first is the concentration level of the hazardous gases such as CO, SO2, NO2, and particulate matter. The second hazardous event was classified as a miner removing the mining helmet off their head. An IR sensor was developed unsuccessfully but an off-the shelf IR sensor was then used to successfully determine when the helmet is on the miner's head. The third hazardous event is defined as an event where miners are struck by an object against the head with a force exceeding a value of 1000 on the HIC (Head Injury Criteria). An accelerometer was used to measure the acceleration of the head and the HIC was calculated in software. The layout of the visualisation software was completed, however the implementation was unsuccessful. Tests were successfully done to calibrate the accelerometer. PCB's that were designed and made included a breakout board and a prototype board. A whole software implementation was done based on Contiki operating system in order to do the control of the measuring of sensors and of calculations done with the measured values. This paper presents the undertaken design detailing solutions to issues raised in previous research.", "In this paper, needs of trusted IOT application are identified and a methodology is proposed to create a framework \"IoTEE\" for rapid prototyping of secure, trusted and commercial IOT applications in absence of hardware. This has been done by analysis of requirements of a sample trusted IOT application heartbeat sensor (hbs), classification of bhs services and their decomposition into trusted and non-trusted components. Furthermore, the methodology includes algorithm design for services like registration, authentication, authorization and secure communication in the proposed framework. Detailed operation sequence of the algorithms is also depicted to understand the overall switching scenario between trusted and non-trusted components of application. Finally, a dynamic deployment structure is created to enable and disable the trusted components in the framework.", ["Purpose - The number of 3D models available on the internet to both students and educators is rapidly expanding.

Freely downloadablemodels, as well as models available for purchase or as 3D printed objects were included in the list. Once the list of 33 websites was created, the data for each individual 3D model in the collections was manually assembled and recorded. The titles of the 3D models, keywords, subject headings, license information, and number of views and downloads were recorded, as this information was available. The data were gathered between January and May 2015, and compiled into a CSV database. To determine how online 3D model content relates to a variety of educational disciplines, relevant subject terms for a variety of educational disciples were extracted from the EBSCO database system.

For the water sport of rowing, managers and coaches use a motorboat to follow a rowing boat for coaching and safe rowing observation. Utilization of a motorboat gives rise to numerous problems in terms of pulled waves, narrow visual ranges, limited tracking of boats at any one time, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs. Moreover, rowing boats present collision risks to other rowing boats or obstacles floating on water, especially for a cox-less rowing boat because the visual direction for rowers is opposite to the moving direction. The aim of this study is to actualize rowing aerial photography using a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV): a radio-controlled small multi-rotor helicopter that has become popularly used for numerous applications recently. We obtained rowing movies using three-camera compositional patterns with changing altitudes and tilt angles. We examined the benefits of rowing aerial photography compared with movies obtained from a motorboat with consideration of safety improvement.", "Healthcare systems are a very important part of the economy of any country and for the public health. In this research, a system is proposed to implement a smart patient management, monitoring and tracking process that can be used in hospitals to automate and organize their information management. The system will create unique identification numbers for each patient which will identify her/him in the health information system.

The system will also provide real-time patient monitoring of vital signs during their stay in an emergency and critical care unit in a hospital. It also alerts hospital staff if any abnormality is detected. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is used to track patients by generating a unique ID. Patient information will be retrieved from the database using this ID. The system will provide a cost-effective means of increasing reliability, privacy and security in the management of healthcare records.

Even though on the one hand such a multitude of technologies has enabled a wide range of applications, on the other hand, it has produced a growing heterogeneity in the IoT scenario. By considering the high-level IoT architecture, such heterogeneity can be overcome by using IoT gateways providing modularity, flexibility and scalability features. In the paper the role of an IoT gateway in the IoT architecture is first described, as well as main wireless communication standards adopted to connect IoT objects, then the AMBER board is presented as an advanced solution able to cope with network heterogeneity in the IoT scenario while providing all above reported features. Thanks to its design concept based on the support of Extender modules and System-on-Modules, AMBER is able to host multiple IoT wireless subsystems developed by a large number of vendors, as well as to increase over the time its computational capabilities, thus being able to accomplish more and more demanding tasks assigned to IoT gateways.", "A recent huge interest in Machine to Machine communication is known as the Internet Of Things (IOT), to allow the possibility for autonomous devices to use Internet for exchanging the data. The Internet and the World Wide Web have caused a revolution in communication between the people. They were born from the need to exchange scientific information between instrumentation. Control System Studio (CSS) (Best Operator Yet Operator Interface) BOY OPI is not only an application but also a framework that can be extended with widgets and data sources.

One of the reasons is the lack of spectrum measurements that would convince the regulators about the abundance of idle spectrum. Spectrum measurements traditionally require expensive instruments and considerable operator's expertise. This has changed with the emergence of low cost spectrum analyzers and smartphones. In this paper we present RFTrack, a software suite that consists of an Android application and a TVWS analysis server. Together, they measure spectrum using a low-cost spectrum analyzer and geotag the data using the phone's internal GPS. The Android application is very easy to use and campaigns can be carried out by non-technical users. Once an Internet connection is available, the program sends data to the server that performs the required processes to present the results in an easy-to-understand way, also allowing for some user customization. The system has been used in eleven countries. We present the results from a measurement campaign in Costa Rica.

Multi-gigabit-per-second links are becoming widespread, and network devices are under continuous stress, so testing whether they guarantee the specified throughput or delay is a must. Software-based solutions, such as packet-train traffic injection, were adequate for lower speeds, but they have become inaccurate in the current scenario. Hardware-based solutions have proved to be very accurate, but usually at the expense of much higher development and acquisition costs. Fortunately, new affordable FPGA SoC devices, as well as high-level synthesis tools, can very efficiently reduce these costs. In this article we show the advantages of hardware-based solutions in terms of accuracy, comparing the results obtained in an FPGA SoC development platform and in NetFPGA-10G to those of software. Results show that a hardware-based solution is significantly better, especially at 10 Gb/s. By leveraging high-level synthesis and open source platforms, prototypes were quickly developed. Noticeable advantages of our proposal are high accuracy, competitive cost with respect to the software counterpart, which runs in high-end off-the-shelf workstations, and the capability to easily evolve to upcoming 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s networks.", "In this chapter we will show how modern FPGA offers the possibility of implementing Reconfigurable Virtual Instrumentation, a new kind of electronic instrumentation which generates interesting opportunities for regular users but that also poses several technical challenges for advanced users and instrument developers.

Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers.

With different choices, we might have a very different Internet today. This paper uses past choices made during the emergence of the early Internet as a lens to look toward its future, which is equally contingent on decisions being made today: by industry, by governments, by users, and by the research community.

These measurements are very often difficult to translate into irrigation advice. Soil water potential (SWP), however, is a basic soil water status variable that is correlated with plant water uptake, and it can easily be measured using sensors. Soil water potential can provide useful support for irrigation scheduling at the field scale, thus enhancing water savings in agricultural areas. In this work, we present the results of an experimental study conducted in the 2014 agricultural season on a peach orchard located in Lodi (Northern Italy). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an irrigation scheduling based on continuous SWP measurements collected at two soil depths (-15 and -35 cm) on the crop water status and the peach production relative to the farmer's commonly adopted irrigation practice. To answer the question in the title, periodic measurements of physiological parameters such as leaf water potential, stomatal resistance (r(s)), transpiration (E), and crop water stress index were performed, along with monitoring of fruit size evolution and fruit sugar content at harvest. All of these variables were measured to assess the crop physiological state of the trees subjected to the two different irrigation treatments, with the final objective of determining whether the irrigation scheduling based on SWP measurements compromised the quality and quantity of produced peaches. Although obtained for only one agricultural season, the results showed that no considerably crop water stress occurred, even for the irrigation treatment based on SWP measurements. In particular, the most extreme values of leaf water potential, r(s), E, and crop water stress index measured at midday were -2 MPa, 45 s m(-1), 1.4 mm h(-1) and 0.5, respectively, which are in good agreement with those observed in many studies for well-watered orchards in Mediterranean areas. In conclusion, we can stress that SWP monitoring can be considered to be a reliable alternative to the more costly and time-consuming physiological measurements for the irrigation scheduling of fruit crops such as peach orchards. This approach provides continuous information about the soil water status, thereby preventing plant water stress and reducing irrigation water consumption at the farm scale.", "A robust wireless system for capacitive ECG is presented, which measures electrode-body capacitive impedance, acceleration, and gyroscope signals from the electrodes to be used in motion artifact reduction algorithms.

STRZSM trails can be captured using remote sensing, in-situ or ground based measurements or through land surface models. Apart from this, new generation of low-cost soil moisture sensors present cost effective way of in-situ measurement of soil moisture, but suffer from inherent heterogeneity between sensing techniques, protocol variations and non-standard calibration methods. Thus, long term monitoring of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture trails requires interoperability between sensing platforms, process-based and statistical modeling and inclusion of remote sensing techniques.

Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and loT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudloT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudloT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudloT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudloT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading.

Local and global control systems handle the devices through dedicated communication channels and interfaces. Each controlled device is practically a \"smart node\" performing a specific task. In addition, very often, those tasks are managed in real-time mode. The performances required to the control interface has an influence on the cost of the distributed nodes as well as on their hardware and software implementation. In large facilities (e.g. CERN) the \"smart nodes\" derive from specific in-house developments. Alternatively, it is possible to find on the market commercial devices, whose performances (and prices) are spread over a broad range, and spanning from proprietary design (customizable to the user's needs) to open source/design. In this paper, we will describe some applications of smart nodes in the particle accelerators field, with special focus on the power supplies for magnets. In modern accelerators, in fact, magnets and their associated power supplies constitute systems distributed along the accelerator itself, and strongly interfaced with the remote control system as well as with more specific (and often more demanding) orbit/trajectory feedback systems.

Real flight test results are given and analyzed in detail, which show that the fixed-wing UAV can track the desired altitude and speed commands during the whole flight process including takeoff, climbing, cruising, gliding, landing, and wave-off by the fault-tolerant control based autopilot.", "This paper presents the design of the small-scale hand-launchable solar-powered AtlantikSolar UAV, summarizes flight results of a continuous 28-hour solar-powered flight that demonstrated AtlantikSolar's capability for energetically perpetual flight, and offers a model-based verification of flight performance and an outlook on the energetic margins that can be provided towards perpetual flight given today's solar-powered UAV technology. AtlantikSolar is a 5.6m-wingspan and 6.9kg mass low-altitude long-endurance UAV that was designed to provide perpetual endurance at a geographic latitude of 45N in a 4-month window centered around June 21st. A specific design emphasis is robust perpetual endurance with respect to local meteorological disturbances (e.g. clouds, winds, downdrafts). Providing the necessary energetic safety margins is a significant challenge on small-scale solar-powered UAVs. This paper thus describes the design optimizations undertaken on the AtlantikSolar UAV for maximum energetic safety margins. In addition, this paper presents the flight test results, analysis and performance verification of AtlantikSolar's first perpetual endurance continuous 28-hour flight. The flight results show a minimum state-of-charge of 40% or excess time of 7 hours during the night. In addition, the charge margin of 5.9 hours indicates sufficiently-fast battery charging during the day. Both margins exceed the performance of previously demonstrated solar-powered LALE UAVs. Another centerpiece of the paper is the verification of these flight results with the theoretical structural-, aerodynamics-and power-models that were developed and used to conceptually design the UAV. The solar-power income model is extended to take into account solar-panel temperature effects, the exact aircraft geometry and the current orientation and is compared against flight results. Finally, the paper provides an analysis and overview into under what conditions and with which energetic margins perpetual flight is possible with today's battery-and solar-cell technology. A perpetual endurance window of up to 6 months around June 21st is predicted at northern latitudes for the AtlantikSolar UAV configuration without payload. A final outlook into first perpetual endurance applications shows that perpetual flight with miniaturized sensing payloads (small optical and infrared cameras) is possible with a perpetual flight window of 4-5 months.", "This paper describes an implementation for a ground station framework based on the actor model and software-defined radios (SDRs), allowing for a highly scalable system that can operate on low-cost receivers or scale to a collection of servers. The actor model defines a concurrent system where the individual unit of computation is the actor and communication between components is handled through a message passing interface. Pystation is an actor framework written in Python that implements a message-passing scheme where each actor has the ability to communicate with local actors or actors across a network. This paper describes some historical and background information on the actor model followed by details of its implementation and examples of use at a ground station. GNU Radio is utilized as the software for physical layer and signal processing, allowing for a highly robust and flexible ground station that can be altered without tedious hardware modifications. The purpose of this framework is to provide the software foundation to the Virginia Tech Ground Station (VTGS) in order to increase reliability and flexibility. The Virginia Tech Ground Station project is meant to serve as a ground station operations and communications sandbox for educational activities, such as student labs and space-based research projects.", ["This paper will describe how with the setup of an Agricultural Remote Sensing Lab at The University of Queensland's Gatton Campus (UQGatton) in late 2014, driven by new undergraduate course developments in Precision Agriculture -plus the role of in-house specifically designed drones with miniature sensors capable of recording agriculturally useful remotely sensed data, has proved successful in stimulating interest and engagement in both traditional agriculture / agribusiness students as well as non-traditional (Engineering and Science) students, to engage with these technologies and techniques.", "Four 'Design & Build' projects will be described in the paper and the role they have played both for the industry partners and the students involved. These projects will include the 'BeneficalBugDrone', the 'NetDrone', the \"UQMiniAgDrone' and the 'RFIDDrone'. Challenges both to the organisation in undertaking such developments and to the students in addressing subject matter outside of their core agricultural interest (for example, understanding the physics of light is a key component of understanding how remotely sensed data can be used for agriculture purposes, as is the need to understand some aspects of avionics and electrical engineering in order to know how to design and build a drone), will be discussed."], "The increasing civilian demand for autonomous aerial vehicle in the professional markets led to an abundance of inexpensive navigational hardware platforms and vehicle prototypes. Current photogrammetry-based applications require crisp and precise positioning of images so that the process does not fails. Also systems adaptable to the circumstances for better effectiveness, vehicles capable of vertical take-off and landing with flight autonomy to define a clear flight path necessary for images order and photogrammetry process relief. In this paper, a simple and low cost design of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) able to satisfy the aforementioned requirements is presented. By structural analysis, building techniques and flight principles, the advantages of a rotary wing were subject to several tests. An state-of-art graphic programming with predefined code plus a high performance development hardware allowed the implementation of a control system and spatial positioning. Furthermore, the integration of a low cost digital camera to the vehicle's body allowed the realization of the aerial photogrammetry-based mapping task in reduced areas, a potential application for the type of UAV presented in this paper, with great expectation in the study of topology in significantly less time for collecting and analyzing data.", "This paper presents a method that can detect driver's drowsiness by using the wavelet packet transform (WPT) and functional link-based fuzzy neural network (FLFNN) models. Drowsy drivers have been reported to be vulnerable to car accidents. Early detection of drowsiness can help alert drivers or passengers to provide a safety drive on the road. For those old models or cars without equipped with advanced high technologies, there is a dire need to install sensor devices that can effectively detect drowsy status of drivers at an early stage. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique that measures relative blood volume changes in the blood vessels and has been universally used for research and physiological study. We develop such PPG sensor devices to be installed on the steering wheel to detect the physiological conditions (such as normal to drowsy) by using parameters extracted from the heart rate variability (HRV) obtained from PPG signal calculation. Experimental results revealed that the proposed model is effective in assessing the drowsy levels of drivers.", "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being used to facilitate monitoring of patients in hospital and home environments. These systems consist of a variety of different components/sensors and many processes like clustering, routing, security, and self-organization. Routing is necessary for medical-based WSNs because it allows remote data delivery and it facilitates network scalability in large hospitals. However, routing entails several problems, mainly due to the open nature of wireless networks, and these need to be addressed. This paper looks at two of the problems that arise due to wireless routing between the nodes and access points of a medical WSN (for IoT use): black hole and selective forwarding (SF) attacks. A solution to the former can readily be provided through the use of cryptographic hashes, while the latter makes use of a neighbourhood watch and threshold-based analysis to detect and correct SF attacks. The scheme proposed here is capable of detecting a selective forwarding attack with over 96% accuracy and successfully identifying the malicious node with 83% accuracy.", "The drift of inertial navigation system (INS) will lead to large navigation error when a low-cost INS is used in microaerial vehicles (MAV). To overcome the above problem, an INS/optical flow/magnetometer integrated navigation scheme is proposed for GPS-denied environment in this paper. The scheme, which is based on extended Kalman filter, combines INS and optical flow information to estimate the velocity and position of MAV. The gyro, accelerator, and magnetometer information are fused together to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is at static state or uniformly moving state; and the gyro only is used to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is accelerating or decelerating. The MAV flight data is used to verify the proposed integrated navigation scheme, and the verification results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the errors of navigation parameters and improve navigation precision.", "Makerspaces-public workshops where makers can share tools and knowledge-are a growing resource for amateurs and professionals alike. While the role of makerspaces in innovation and peer learning is widely discussed, we attempt to look at the wider roles that makerspaces play in public life. Through site visits and interviews at makerspaces and similar facilities across the UK, we have identified additional roles that these spaces play: as social spaces, in supporting wellbeing, by serving the needs of the communities they are located in and by reaching out to excluded groups. Based on these findings, we suggest implications and future directions for both makerspace organisers and community researchers.", null, "Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning.

In addition, most of them are not portable and do not deliver a fully integrated force, tactile and visual user experience. In an attempt to break through these limitations, we have created the Haplet: an open-source, portable and affordable haptic device with colocated visual, force and tactile feedback. The triple colocated user experience is delivered by a small-form parallel robotic mechanism that features a simple vibrotactile actuator at the end-effector. The robotic arm is optically transparent and is motorized at the base where it clips on a tablet or computer screen. All the electronic components are encapsulated into a custom designed board based on the Arduino Due microcontroller. This board interfaces computer software to the Haplet's hardware with a capacity of up to four motors and encoders and two vibrotactile actuators. This paper describes our ongoing research on developing the Haplet; and, reports our initial experimental studies on quantifying the effect of visual-force-tactile feedback colocation on the user's experience and performance.", "The article showcases a case study of Cloud Computing model combined with AT-Mega microcontrollers for educational purposes.

The proliferation of improvised explosive devices of all types in the Iraqi and Afghan theaters has demonstrated that inexpensive, commercial off-the-shelf technology and some electronics knowledge can be combined to significantly impact high-tech operations. Autonomous GPS-guided and semi-autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles will change the paradigm in their employment in the very near future. While a single attack might be insignificant, a swarm of robotic devices could prove a credible threat. In this paper we discuss the impact and limitations of commercially off-the-shelf drones and what measures might be used to counter these devices.

These necessary efforts are however constrained if the surrounding business model patterns are not challenged at the same time. In this article, open source design (OSD) is presented as a potential concept leading towards alternative and eco-efficient production and consumption patterns. Potential advantages of OSD for environmental sustainability are hypothesized and confronted with the analysis of the environmental friendliness of four open source products. Two synergies between sustainable design and OSD are identified (product modularity and design for local manufacturing) as well as corresponding challenges for further research.", "This article explores the socio-environmental implications of two different value models currently competing for dominance in the digital economy: the neo-feudal cognitive capitalism (NFCC) and the hypothetical case of mature peer production (HMPP). Using a systematisation that considers environmental effects of information and communication technologies as direct, indirect and structural, this article discerns the future socio-environmental scenarios indicative of each value model. We argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. Likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the NFCC is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the HMPP is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons. Hence, the latter is considered as the socio-environmentally auspicious choice, but comes not without transitional challenges of its own. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems.

We use these concepts to reflect on four unique interactive artefacts, which all in different ways embrace aspects of Wabi-Sabi, in terms of their design gestalt, materiality, but also in terms of use practices.

These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration.

The flexibility of the monitoring system is fundamental, especially in case of existing buildings, where the use of a considerable quantity of cable could compromise the normal exercise, could affect the quality of acquired signal and finally be too expensive. For these reasons, the adoption of wireless sensor networks able to manage several accelerometers nodes is desirable. Wireless sensor networks have several critical aspects to solve: most important are the synchronism and the high determinism in data sampling required in this kind of applications, and the possible loss of data during the wireless transmission. The purpose of this work is to show and discuss the results obtained with a wireless sensors system for structural health monitoring of buildings or infrastructures placed in seismic zones.

These new tools and technologies lower the design costs, but also allow rapid creation of fully functional components. This paper describes the FDM and 3DP rapid prototyping technologies that were used to create elements and tools in the wood industry field. Total costs of manufacturing related to the fabrication of sample elements and tools are analysed. One of the main recognised issues of wider application of rapid prototyping technologies is their still very high costs related to all production aspects, starting with a lack of available materials, material cost, up to high cost of available commercial equipment, usually focused only on specific solutions and limited range of materials. Generally, AM costs can be divided into the group of fixed costs and variable ones. This paper deals with the optimization of the production costs of fabricated elements in case of small-scale production, and optimization of variable costs (processing and post-processing, costs of enforcement, and material costs).", "Developing self-organised swarm systems capable of adapting to environmental changes as well as to dynamic situations is a complex challenge. An efficient labour division model, with the ability to regulate the distribution of work among swarm robots, is an important element of this kind of system.

Experiments were carried out in simulation and in real-robot scenarios with the aim of studying the performance of this new adaptive model. Results presented in this paper verify that the extended approach improves on the adaptability of previous systems. For example, by reducing collision duration among robots in foraging missions, our approach helps small swarms of robots to adapt more efficiently to changing environments, thus increasing their self-sustainability (survival rate).

This article explores the role of free software in the practices of digital artists, animators and technicians who work in various roles for the contemporary digital visual media industries. Rather than discussing it as a model of organising work, the study conceives free software as a production tool and shows how it becomes a locus of politics about finding material security in flexible capitalism. This politics is ultimately contradictory in that it extends creative and craft autonomy of digital artists but does not mobilise a critical project. Instead, it nurtures further precarious labour.

We argue that for bioengineering to fully access biological potential, it will require application of statistically designed experiments to derive detailed empirical models of underlying systems. This requires execution of large-scale structured experimentation for which laboratory automation is necessary. This requires development of expressive, high-level languages that allow reusability of protocols, characterization of their reliability, and a change in focus from implementation details to functional properties.

LSFM achieves optical sectioning by the selective illumination of a single plane of the sample with a sheet of laser light while simultaneously recording emitted fluorescence orthogonally to the illumination plane. A 3D image of the sample can then be generated with a temporal resolution ranging from seconds to several days, and at scales ranging from subcellular to whole organ. By design, LSFM provides fast imaging, and low phototoxicity, two key criteria for live imaging under physiological conditions. Despite its potential, LSFM remains underutilized in plant biology. This review aims to highlight challenges of live imaging in plants, to describe key steps in using LSFM on live plant samples and finally at providing an overview of published examples of applications of LSFM in plants.", "Popular portraits of hacking have often relied on histories of hobbyist engineering culture rooted in tales of middle-class, college-educated, and often male technologists.

Single-molecule localizationmicroscopy (SMLM)(1-3) techniques have been established as important tools for studying cellular features with resolutions of the order of around 10 nm. However, in their current form these modalities are limited by a highly constrained field of view (FOV) and field-dependent image resolution. Here, we develop a low-cost microlens array (MLA)-based epi-illumination system-flat illumination for field-independent imaging (FIFI)-that can efficiently and homogeneously perform simultaneous imaging of multiple cells with nanoscale resolution. The optical principle of FIFI, which is an extension of the Kohler integrator, is further elucidated and modelled with a new, free simulation package. We demonstrate FIFI's capabilities by imaging multiple COS-7 and bacteria cells in 100 x 100 mu m(2) SMLM images-more than quadrupling the size of a typical FOV and producing near-gigapixel-sized images of uniformly high quality.", "Currently, multi-rotor UAV's navigation mainly depends on satellite navigation systems. In many environments (e.g., indoor, urban, or canyon), lack of satellite signal will lead UAV navigation to failure. In that case, one backup solution is to use the inertial navigation method. Inertial navigation method integrates measurements from gyroscope and accelerometer to obtain the orientation, speed, and position. Due to the instability of sensor bias, a slight orientation error caused by gyroscopic bias change will lead to enormous position error. Noting that there is a strong correlation between the pose and velocity for a flying multi-rotor UAV, we can search for a solution to calculate velocity directly from UAV's pose. In this work, we propose to use support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning technique to predict the moving speed of the aircraft. This approach builds a relationship directly between the orientation data and velocity by training. The experiment has two stages. In early stage, we have tested our method in simulation environment; then at later stage, we have tested our method in real-world cases. Experimental results our method can predict the UAV's velocity within the error of 0.3 m/s and the squared correlation coefficient between the predicted velocity and the ground truth is about 0.8. The method can be used as a complementary navigation source to achieve higher localization accuracy and stability.", "HCI research has both endorsed \"making\" for its innovation and democratization capacity and critiqued its underlying technosolutionism, i.e., the idea that technology provides solutions to complex social problems.

It applies anthropological theory of the global and feminist-utopianism to the analysis of findings from research on making cultures in Taiwan and China. More specifically, the paper provides ethnographic snippets of utopian glimmers in order to speculatively imagine and explore alternative futures of making worth pursuing, and in so doing reconstitute the utopian vision of making.", "This paper applies the theoretical lens of infrastructure to study hacking practices that take issue with large-scale communication networks. The paper analyzes a series of hacks targeting the Global System for Mobile Communications (i.e., networks for mobile telephony) carried out by a cluster of people affiliated or sympathetic to the German Chaos Computer Club between 2001 and 2014. These hacks aim at acquiring proprietary knowledge and facilitating the autonomous operation of local mobile phone networks for communities, independent of corporate network providers. The contribution of this paper is to show how hacking of this kind can be understood as transgressive infrastructuring, a way of engaging critically with infrastructure that, in the case of GSM hacking, relied on three strategies-reverse engineering, re-implementation, and parallel operation, all of which aim at appropriating the targeted network intellectually, legally, functionally, and/or operationally.", "Haptic technology has the potential to expand and transform the ways that students can experience a variety of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. Designing kinesthetic haptic devices for educational applications is challenging because of the competing objectives of using low-cost components, making the device robust enough to be handled by students, and the desire to render high fidelity haptic virtual environments. In this paper, we present the evolution of a device called \" Hapkit\": a low cost, one-degree-of-freedom haptic kit that can be assembled by students. From 2013-2015, different versions of Hapkit were used in courses as a tool to teach haptics, physics, and control. These include a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), two undergraduate courses, a graduate course, and a middle school class. Based on our experience using Hapkit in these educational environments, we evolved the design in terms of its structural materials, drive mechanism, and mechatronic components. Our latest design, Hapkit 3.0, includes several features that allow students to manufacture and assemble a robust and high-fidelity haptic device. First, it uses 3-D printed plastic structural material, which allows the design to be built and customized using readily available tools. Second, the design takes into account the limitations of 3-D printing, such as warping during printing and poor tolerances. This is achieved at a materials cost of approximately US $ 50, which makes it feasible for distribution in classroom and online education settings. The open source design is available at http://hapkit. stanford. edu.", "Industrial control systems have traditionally been built around dedicated wired solutions. The requirements of flexibility, mobility, and cost have created a strong push toward wireless solutions, preferably solutions requiring low power. Simultaneously, the increased need for interoperability and integration with the wider Internet made a transition to IP-based communication unavoidable. Following these trends, we survey 6TiSCH, the emerging family of standards for IP-based industrial communication over low-power and lossy networks. We describe the state of the standardization work, the major issues being discussed, and open questions recently identified. Based on extensive first-hand experience, we discuss challenges in implementation of this new wave of standards. Lessons learned are highlighted from four popular open-source implementations of these standards: OpenWSN, Contiki, RIOT, and TinyOS. We outline major requirements, present insights from early interoperability testing and performance evaluations, and provide guidelines for chip manufacturers and implementers.", "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are susceptible to faults both in sensors and in communication. Information fusion techniques allow to extract precise information from a large amount of data. Detection, identification and treatment of outlier, in these techniques, is a key point. Outlier detection in WSNs is a challenge due to the low capacity of the nodes and low bandwidth of the network. This paper proposes a methodology that applies the clustering and lightweight statistics techniques for detection of outliers in WSNs. The assessment of the methodology involves a case study with temperature sensors in WSN nodes. The results show that this methodology is able to provide precise information, even in the presence of outliers.", null, "Integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) technology focused on the aircraft-level fault diagnosis, prediction and health management.

The great amounts of data coming from these devices introduce some challenges related to the storage and processing capabilities of the information. This strengthens the novel paradigm known as Big Data. In such a complex scenario, the Cloud computing is an efficient solution for the managing of sensor data.

The control is adaptive to various system parameters. We prove exponential stability of the error dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate controller performance.", "Many today believe that the mobile Internet was invented by Apple in the USA with their iPhone, enabling a data-driven Internet ecosystem to disrupt the staid voice and SMS business models of the telecom carriers. History, however, shows that the mobile Internet was first successfully commercialised in Japan, in 1999. Some authors such as Richard Feasey in Telecommunications Policy (Issue 6, 2015) argue that operators had been confused and unprepared when the Internet emerged and introduced \"walled gardens\", without Internet access. This comment article reviews in detail how the operators reacted when the fixed, and later the mobile Internet spread: some introduced walled gardens, some opened it for the \"unofficial\" content on the Internet. The article concludes that most large European telecom and information technology companies and their investors have a tradition of risk avoidance and pursued high-price strategies that led them to regularly fail against better and cheaper foreign products and services, not only when the wireless Internet was introduced, but also when PCs and the fixed Internet were introduced. Consequences, such as the need to enable future disruptions and boost the skills needed to master them, are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited.", "Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence.

Selection of Petri nets as reference modeling formalism provides support for a comprehensive specification and documentation of the system, complementing graphical expressiveness with formal verification capabilities. A Petri nets based development flow targeted for the design of distributed embedded controllers and cyber-physical systems is presented. Input-Output Place-Transition Petri nets (IOPT nets) are used as the underlying formalism, allowing explicit representation of dependencies on input and output signals and events (as common whenever generation of code for controllers is foreseen). Distributed execution is addressed adding the concept of time domains and communication channels to IOPT nets. The IOPT-Tools tool chain framework supports the whole development process from specification to implementation, including tools for model edition, simulation, properties verification, and automatic code generation targeting for deployment into specific implementation platforms (where VHDL coding is used for hardware-based implementation and C coding is selected for software-oriented implementation).", "While sharing design projects is often seen as an essential component of participating in the maker community, ways in which young people can meaningfully participate have only begun to be supported.

The pattern is also useful to estimate the UAV position while approaching the target or during the hovering close to the target.

They have the potential to disrupt existing socio-economic facets of everyday life. Yet few studies have analysed the development of robotics innovation. This paper closes this gap by analysing current developments in innovation in robotics; how it is diffused, and what role is played by intellectual property (IP). The paper argues that robotics clusters are mainly located in the US and Europe, despite a growing presence in South Korea and China. The robotics innovation ecosystem builds on cooperative networks of actors, including individuals, research institutions, and firms. Governments play a significant role in supporting robotics innovation through funding, military demand, and national robotics strategies. Robotics competitions and prizes provide an important incentive for innovation. Patents are used to exclude third parties to secure freedom of operation, license technologies, and avoid litigation. The countries with the highest number of patent claims arc Japan, China, South Korea, and the US. The growing stock of patents owned by universities and PROs, particularly in China, is noteworthy too. Automotive and electronics companies are still the largest patent filers, but medical technologies and the Internet are emerging as new actors in the field. Secrecy is often used as a tool to appropriate innovation. Copyright protection is relevant to robotics also, mainly for its role in protecting software. Finally, open-source robotics platforms are increasingly used in the early stages of the innovation process as they allow new actors in the robotics field to optimize their initial spending on innovation.", "This paper describes the structure of a mobile robot suitable for laboratory experiments.

The proposed system is a differential wheeled robot built based on an Arduino platform, it has a small physical size and it is capable of wireless communication. These characteristics make it useful for validating planning algorithms for mobile robots in computer-guided laboratory experiments, while lowering the expenses required by such a setup. Moreover, in order to compensate the communication delay between the central computer and the robot, an estimation algorithm is implemented on the robot for obtaining a smoother motion.", "A critical step towards smarter and safer cities is to endow them with the abilities to massively gather a wide variety of data sets and to automatically feed those data to decision support tools and applications that leverage artificial intelligence.

The democratic ideal of personal fabrication and the maker culture movement - represented by the growth of open makerspaces (e.g. FabLabs, makerspaces) and online communities (e.g. 'Instructables', 'Thingiverse') worldwide - provides everyone with the opportunity to make (almost) anything. However, structurally engaging non-expert users still remains an important challenge for most open makerspaces. Therefore, this article focuses on the potential of open makerspaces for communities and - more specifically - how to involve nonexpert users in these open makerspaces. Framed within the fields of Participatory Design and infrastructuring, this article presents two case studies ` Hack-a-thing' and 'Making Things' - that are part of a long-term participation process of engaging local non-expert users in FabLab Genk. In these cases, the involved non-expert users entailed teenagers, children and their supervisors (for instance, supervisors involved in participating youth organisations). The case studies show that building relations with existing communities of non-expert users and creating conditions for them to self-organise their activities within open makerspaces are essential starting points for processes of long-term engagement.", "In this paper, the drive system of palletizing robot is designed.

A prototype of this new ASV was developed as part of an 8-month undergraduate capstone project at Santa Clara University. The resulting system has a modular aluminum chassis, marine grade thrusters, and an open source autopilot system. The system has undergone initial field testing and has demonstrated the ability to navigate along paths in a region of interest to within 1 meter. This paper reviews the design of the vehicle, illustrates its navigation performance to date, and discusses plans for future work.", "Twitter's hashtag functionality is now used for a very wide variety of purposes, from covering crises and other breaking news events through gathering an instant community around shared media texts (such as sporting events and TV broadcasts) to signalling emotive states from amusement to despair. These divergent uses of the hashtag are increasingly recognised in the literature, with attention paid especially to the ability for hashtags to facilitate the creation of ad hoc or hashtag publics. A more comprehensive understanding of these different uses of hashtags has yet to be developed, however. Previous research has explored the potential for a systematic analysis of the quantitative metrics that could be generated from processing a series of hashtag datasets. Such research found, for example, that crisis-related hashtags exhibited a significantly larger incidence of retweets and tweets containing URLs than hashtags relating to televised events, and on this basis hypothesised that the information-seeking and -sharing behaviours of Twitter users in such different contexts were substantially divergent. This article updates such study and their methodology by examining the communicative metrics of a considerably larger and more diverse number of hashtag datasets, compiled over the past five years. This provides an opportunity both to confirm earlier findings, as well as to explore whether hashtag use practices may have shifted subsequently as Twitter's userbase has developed further; it also enables the identification of further hashtag types beyond the \"crisis\" and \"mainstream media event\" types outlined to date. The article also explores the presence of such patterns beyond recognised hashtags, by incorporating an analysis of a number of keyword-based datasets. This large-scale, comparative approach contributes towards the establishment of a more comprehensive typology of hashtags and their publics, and the metrics it describes will also be able to be used to classify new hashtags emerging in the future. In turn, this may enable researchers to develop systems for automatically distinguishing newly trending topics into a number of event types, which may be useful for example for the automatic detection of acute crises and other breaking news events.", "Most widely used instruction set architectures (ISAs) are proprietary, while much software innovation is facilitated by being open.

The main building blocks for such a system are: spiral wavefront beacon in conjunction with a standard (circular) acoustic modem, Chip Scale Atomic Clocks (CSAC), acoustic modems, state-of-the-art adaptive underwater networking and Cooperative Localization (CL) algorithms. Using the difference in time of arrival between the spiral wavefront and the modem circular wavefront, receivers will be able to determine the bearing to the source using only one hydrophone. Synchronizing vehicles Chip Scale Atomic Clocks (CSAC) with the beacon at the beginning; of the mission and during the longer missions will ensure the vehicles ability to also calculate their distance from the beacon upon every message reception.

Hence, to overcome the security problems in the 4G network, in this paper we propose to develop distributed security architecture for authentication.

Electronics is often ignored in robotics courses. Since robotics courses are typically comprised of computer-related subjects, and mechanical and electrical engineering, these three areas should be emphasized equally. Many studies reveal impressive learning of computer science and mechanical engineering, but clear evidence of the effectiveness of electronics learning in the higher order thinking skills of middle school students is still lacking. We designed three different robotics courses with electronics subject matter introduced through experiential learning. A parallel group design was used, where three different open learning courses were implemented for middle school students. Based on results of the first and second implementations, we improved students' learning of relevant content for each successive step of the experiment. In total, 381 middle school students participated in all experiments and were surveyed using pre- and post-tests. The collected data were analyzed using a quantitative research methodology. The findings revealed that the teaching approach was effective. During the learning process, student interest in robotics increased, and overall achievement improved with a medium effect size (eta(2) = 0.13). The best results for the learning of electronics subject matter were found in the learning process (eta(2) = 0.44), where experimental sharing of electronics parts was the most evident approach used by the students. Examination of learning material structure in light of the shared electronics subject matter is analyzed and discussed and possible directions for future research are presented.", "The objective of this work is to develop a framework that can deploy and provide coordination between multiple heterogeneous agents when a swarm robotic system adopts a decentralized approach; each robot evaluates its relative rank among the other robots in terms of travel distance and cost to the goal. Accordingly, robots are allocated to the sub-tasks for which they have the highest rank (utility). This paper provides an analysis of existing swarm control environments and proposes a software environment that facilitates a rapid deployment of multiple robotic agents. The framework (UBSwarm) exploits our utility-based task allocation algorithm. UBSwarm configures these robots and assigns the group of robots a particular task from a set of available tasks. Two major tasks have been introduced that show the performance of a robotic group. This robotic group is composed of heterogeneous agents. In the results, a premature example that has prior knowledge about the experiment shows whether or not the robots are able to accomplish the task.", "This work presents the modeling and control of an aerial manipulator based on a quadrotor with a robotic arm using the dual quaternion approach. First the kinematic model of the complete system is obtained using dual quaternions to represent multiple rotations and translations, then the dynamic model is developed via the Newton-Euler formalism. A position control law is used to stabilize the vehicle around a desired position and orientation using a smooth trajectory. The closed-loop system is then numerically simulated to corroborate stability. In addition, experimental flight tests were performed for validation.", "Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters provides farmers with useful information, which can improve the quality and productivity of crops grown in greenhouses. The objective of this study was to develop a greenhouse environment measurement system using a low-cost microcontroller with open-source software. Greenhouse environment parameters measured were air temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The ranges of the temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration were -40 to 120 degrees C, 0 to 100%, and 0 to 10,000 ppm, respectively. A 128 x 64 graphic LCD display was used for real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environments. An Arduino Uno R3 consisted of a USB interface for communicating with a computer, 6 analog inputs, and 14 digital input/output pins. A temperature/relative humidity sensor was connected to digital pins 2 and 3. A CO2 sensor was connected to digital pins 12 and 13. The LCD was connected to digital pin 1 (TX). The sketches were programmed with the Arduino Software (IDE). A measurement system including the Arduino board, sensors, and accessories was developed (totaling $244). Data for the environmental parameters in a venlo-type greenhouse were obtained using this system without any problems. We expect that the low-cost microcontroller using open-source software can be used for monitoring the environments of plastic greenhouses in Korea.", "Optical approaches for hydrophone calibrations offer significant advantages over existing methods based on reciprocity. In particular, heterodyne and homodyne interferometry can accurately measure particle velocity and displacements at a specific point in space thus enabling the acoustical pressure to be measured in an absolute, direct, assumption-free manner, with traceability through the SI definition of the metre. The calibration of a hydrophone can then be performed by placing the active element of the sensor at the point where the acoustic pressure field was measured and monitoring its electrical output. However, it is crucial to validate the performance and accuracy of such optical methods by direct comparison rather than through device calibration. Here we report on the direct comparison of two such optical interferometers used in underwater acoustics and ultrasonics in terms of acoustic pressure estimation and their associated uncertainties in the frequency range 200 kHz-3.5 MHz, with results showing agreement better than 1% in terms of pressure and typical expanded uncertainties better than 3% for both reported methods.", "With the development of new technologies, which are able to connect with each other through network, the Internet of things (IoT), raised its popularity.

In the development of an AQMS, we have used the GSM wireless communication module. The developed system is capable of the real-time measurement of air polluted gases, such as CO2, CO, NO2, and SO2. The machine-to-machine communication of the air quality monitoring station and PC with the sink node was successfully implemented. Various gas sensor technologies were evaluated for the system and ultimately electrochemical and infrared sensors were used. Hardware and software for an AQMS was designed and implemented. The AQMS uses an array of sensors to take the measurements of the ambient air surrounding it and wirelessly transmits the data to the base station. A graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy for end user(s) to interact with the system, was developed. Gas concentration values are plotted on the GUI. The defined calibration of the instruments at time interims assures that the desired accuracy is sustained.

This shift has considerable socio-economic and cultural implications that are too often ignored by the existing economic and political economy literatures. This article surveys key patterns in the adoption of digital platforms across Europe, and finds, based on an array of quantitative metrics, apparently contradictory trends. We observe, on one hand, the rise of closed TV platforms as the paradigmatic commercial model of the new media landscape; but on the other, the cultural and material openness of the Internet, which is radically transforming the consumption of television. While hybrid arrangements abound, industry solutions are still awkwardly matched to consumer preferences. Without drawing too sharp a line between technology and culture, the article presents an overview of the many ways the changing meaning of digital platforms continues to shape the global television industry.

The proposed method relies strictly on onboard sensors of employed MAVs and does not require any external positioning system. The core of the method consists in extraction of information from pictures consequently captured using a camera carried by the particular MAV. Visual features are obtained from images of the surface under the MAV, and stored into a map that is represented by these features. The position of the MAV is then obtained through matching with previously stored features. An important part of the proposed system is a novel approach for exploration and mapping of the workspace of robots. This method enables efficient exploring of the unknown environment, while keeping the iteratively built map of features consistent. The proposed algorithm is suitable for mapping of surfaces, both outdoor and indoor, with various density of the image features. The sufficient precision and long term persistence of the method allows its utilization for stabilization of large MAV groups that work in formations with small relative distances between particular vehicles. Numerous experiments with quadrotor helicopters and various numerical simulations have been realized for verification of the entire system and its components.", "This paper presents a study of the threat of malicious interference to GNSS and examines the special case where the jamming device is incrementally more sophisticated than a typical always-on interference source. The concept of a systematic jamming attack is considered, where the interference signal is intentionally synchronized with the GNSS signals, with the intention of causing maximum disruption with the minimum power expenditure. Various attack methodologies are examined for the case of a civilian L1 receiver. It is shown that, depending on the attack strategy, the target signal and the target receiver, data-recovery, navigation and timing can be denied to a user with some tens of decibels less average power than a traditional jamming attack. It is further shown that some attacks may be capable to effectively deny some receiver functionality in a subtle manner such that presence of the malicious interference goes undetected. Key signal and receiver features that expose a vulnerability are identified and some means of improving receiver robustness are provided.", "In this paper, we describe the design considerations and implementation of a smart toy system, a technology for supporting the automatic recording and analysis for detecting developmental delays recognition when children play using the smart toy.

The system is composed of a computer-based control monitoring unit (CMU) and several remote process transceivers (RPTs). The CMU contains a software program and a transceiver. It issues commands to and receives sensor data from the RPTs. It also saves previous data and displays the current sensor data from each RPT through a graphical user interface. The RPTs are stationed along the length of water systems like rivers where water data are sampled and sent to the CMU. Sensor data include the temperature, level, and turbidity of the water at the location of a particular RPT. The scalability feature allows the system to cover a much extended distance along the length of a river. It is achieved through the ability of the RPTs to relay the command from the CMU to other RPTs and the data from other RPTs to the CMU using user-defined protocols. Test results show that an effective distance of 1300 m is achieved between the CMU and the nearest RPT and between RPTs. Further, there are no significant differences between the actual sensor data and the values received at the CMU.", "In this project, a medium access control utilizing the technique of time-division multiple access was developed for the intra-body communication.

We argue that these do-it-yourself biology practices contain significant epistemological similarities with the well-established tradition of action research and indicate that both practices share the political objective to empower individuals to actively build their own future but that they prioritize different strategies. Action research investigates opportunities for empowerment in typical social domains while do-it-yourself biology focuses on the material dimension of socio-technical realities. By reviewing some do-it-yourself biology practices from the core basic principles of action research, the article aims to develop insight whether and in which forms a connectivity can be realized between these different practices leading to future collective actions among these practices.", "This paper proposes an attitude estimation method based on optical flow to solve the attitude tracking control problem for a three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) lab helicopter. First, the relationship between optical flow and the motion of a general unmanned aerial vehicle is derived from the transformation between the image coordinate frame and the world coordinate frame. Then, an expression for the angular velocity of the 3-DOF helicopter is deduced only based on optical flow, and the attitude information is acquired by solving nonlinear equations. Finally, using visual feedback, a linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller is designed for hovering and tracking, which consists of a feedforward controller and a LQR state feedback controller. Closed-loop experimental results on the lab helicopter demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation and control methods.", "Some earthquakes generate tsunamis in the ocean or coastal regions. An early alert is essential for the coastal population to prevent loss of human life. The propagation of the alert is made through a range of communication means: radio, television, sirens, landlines and cell phones, social media including Twitter, and, if electrical power and communications utilities are blacked-out, through an alternative opportunistic network. In this article, a special device, named Witness Unit (WU), designed to work with a satellite network is presented as an alternative communications means in a temporarily degraded disaster environment. A greedy heuristic algorithm for the placement and deployment of the WUs is introduced and its interaction with emergency managers and citizens is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The general approach relies on technological determinism, whereby the discussion revolves around how and to what extent will ICT support development. It assumes the benefits of ICT as inherent. This approach ignores that ICT is created and experienced within a socially divisive and complex space. A more critical and sociological analysis is needed for development studies to better understand the implications of ICT initiatives. In this article, I argue that Saskia Sassen's analytical framework of technology and society as embedded avoids this technological determinism and allows social theorists to account for social and material aspects of ICT. To support this alternative framework, I present a case study of a rural ICT initiative in Gujarat, India, and discuss how this re-conceptualization reveals more nuanced understanding of ICT and society. Based on interviews and field research, I find that technology creates new social understandings for the rural ICT users, but also that society shapes the technology to make it inaccessible for them.", "This document presents the reconfiguration of solar panels to improve the power curve from a Photovoltaic array. The proposal consists in an embedded system aimed to reconnect each PV panel and therefore change the properties of the entire array.

In the detector readout, FPGA-based data processing boards (DPB) are organized in a large number of computing crates. At the crate level, the TFC master is connected to one TFC slave per crate, whereas the DPB AMCs are interconnected by the crates' infrastructure. In this article, an FMC-based signal distribution board is proposed allowing the transmission of a high-quality clock and timing and fast-control data from and to connected TFC slaves at distances of about 30 meters using twisted-pair cables.", "A soft condensed matter sensor (SCMS) designed to measure strains on the human body is presented. The hybrid material based on carbon black (CB) and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was bonded to a textile elastic band and used as a sensor on the human wrist to measure hand motion by detecting the movement of tendons in the wrist. Additionally it was able to track the blood pulse wave of a person, allowing for the determination of pulse wave peaks corresponding to the systole and diastole blood pressures in order to calculate the heart rate. Sensor characterization was done using mechanical cycle testing, and the band sensor achieved a gauge factor of 4-6.3 while displaying low signal relaxation when held at a strain levels. Near-linear signal performance was displayed when loading to successively higher strain levels up to 50% strain.", null, "In order to allow Micro Areal Vehicles (MAVs) to autonomously explore urban areas a precise knowledge of the MAV's kinematic state is essential. Thus, an integrated navigation system is presented in this paper. It provides a precise self-localization in both; indoor and outdoor areas. In order to circumvent the disadvantages of common image or laser based navigation systems, the information from both sensors are fused together on an early stage. That means, laser rangefinder's distance measurements are referred to image pixels. This results in 2.5-D images. But in order to do so, the pose between both sensors has to be known. Therefore a process that allows a calibration of the sensors' extrinsic parameters is presented in this paper. Our navigation filter bases on a reduced SLAM approach combined with relative motion measurements. Both elements benefit from the 2.5-D images. The scale factor of the relative translational motion can be simply measured, while the landmarks can be initialized instantaneously with precisely known depth. This results in a navigation system that provides precise and long-term stable navigation solutions, independently from structure and condition of the environment.", "Generation of accurate IP power models requires determination of correct simulation conditions for the different input pins of the IP. Determining such a set of inputs for individual IP blocks in a design is expensive in cost and time, and is also highly error prone. Additionally, it is desirable to identify IP instances in a design, where these simulation conditions are not met. These are relevant problems in the context of modern day microprocessor designs, which are designed using a very large number of IPs, either developed in-house or sourced from external vendors. In this paper, we examine these problems in an industrial context and introduce FVCAG, a framework for enabling efficient and accurate power modelling. FVCAG enables a more thorough IP power modelling than that can be accomplished using current state of the art techniques. Experimental evaluation of the proposed framework on the standard cell library and macros used in the design of an industry class high performance microprocessor design demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of proposed framework.", "The research area of the compressed baryonic matter - CBM experiment (FAIR/GSI in Darmstadt) is sub-nuclear physics, thus hadron-baryon and quark-gluon, and the essence of phase transitions in the area of hot nuclear matter, and dense strongly interacting matter. Our interest in this paper are mainly considerations on the impact of such large infrastructural experiments and possibilities they give to local, smaller but very active, university based research groups and communities. Research and technical input from such groups is depicted on the background of the CBM detector infrastructure and electronic instrumentation just under design and test fabrication for this experiment. An essential input to this research originates from Poland via the agreed in-kind contribution. The areas of expertise of these groups are: superconductivity, structural large scale cabling, precision machined parts, RF and microwave technology, analog and advanced digital electronics, distributed measurement and control systems, etc.", "In this paper, a hybrid low-pass and de-trending (HLPD) filtering technique is proposed to achieve robust position estimates using an optical flow based sensor which calculates velocity information at a rate of 400 Hz. In order to filter out the high frequency oscillation in the velocity information, a standard low-pass filter is implemented. The low-pass filter successfully eliminates sudden jumps and missing data-points, which prevents unprecedented maneuvers and mid-air crashes. The integrated position estimate has the accumulated drift which occurs due to electrical signal and temperature fluctuations together with other environmental factors which affect the data acquisition from the optical flow sensor. A recursive linear least squares fit is performed for the drift model and de-trending is applied to the integrated position signal. The performance of the proposed estimator is validated by comparing with model-identification based weighted average (MI-WA) position estimator; which is commonly used in quadcopters for position estimation. Simulation and experimental flight tests are conducted and the results show that the flight performance of HLPD filter is better than the extensively used MI-WA position filter in hover and square pattern flight tests.", "Compressed bitmap indices are heavily used in scientific and commercial database systems because they largely improve query performance for various workloads. Early research focused on finding tailor-made index compression schemes that are amenable for modern processors. Improving performance further typically comes at the expense of a lower compression rate, which is in many applications not acceptable because of memory limitations. Alternatively, tailor-made hardware allows to achieve a performance that can only hardly be reached with software running on general-purpose CPUs. In this paper, we will show how to create a custom instruction set framework for compressed bitmap processing that is generic enough to implement most of the major compressed bitmap indices. For evaluation, we implemented WAH, PLWAH, and COMPAX operations using our framework and compared the resulting implementation to multiple state-of-the-art processors. We show that the custom-made bitmap processor achieves speedups of up to one order of magnitude by also using two orders of magnitude less energy compared to a modern energy-efficient Intel processor. Finally, we discuss how to embed our processor with database-specific instruction sets into database system environments.", "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality, but its genetic etiology is largely unknown and likely complex involving multiple genes. The Kcna1 gene encodes Kv1.1 potassium channels that act to dampen neuronal excitability whereas the Scn2a gene encodes Nav1.2 sodium channels important for action potential conduction. We tested the hypothesis that subclinical Scn2a heterozygosity reduces SUDEP incidence in Kcna1-null mice of SUDEP, by suppressing neurocardiac dysfunction associated with the absence of Kv1.1 channels. SUDEP-prone Kcna1-null mice exhibited about a 50% increase in lifespan when heterozygous for the Scn2a-null allele, that is Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-). In simultaneous video electroencephalography (EEG)-electrocardiography (ECG) recordings, Scn2a heterozygosity did not eliminate seizures in Kcna1(-/-)mice, but seizure burden was partially reduced due to a significant reduction in seizure durations. Analysis of beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that Kcna1(-/-) and Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-) mice exhibit similarly high RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences), suggesting the functional interactions between the two mutations do not involve significant alteration of parasympathetic tone. Moreover, analysis of EEG-ECG interaction dynamics revealed a significantly higher degree of association between brain and cardiac activity in double mutant mice compared to Kcna1(-/-)animals for several different measures, suggesting that Scn2a-null heterozygosity reduces SUDEP risk by altering neural control of the heart. These findings expand our understanding of the complex genetic interactions underlying SUDEP and identify EEG-ECG association as a potential new biomarker of SUDEP susceptibility.", "The growing demand for low cost and easy to use analytical devices requires the development of reliable and rapid deposition strategies suitable for changing easily planned designs and applicable to a wide range of materials for assembling conductive tracks and sensitive elements. Further important challenges to be pursued are the possibility of using readily available instrumentation and reducing power consumption and hazardous chemical waste. This review provides an overview of the use of portable day-to-day writing tools, such as pencils and pens, for the rapid and on-demand deposition of conductive patterns on different substrates, with particular emphasis on the assembly of \"Do It Yourself\" sensors. Moreover, layer-by-layer deposition of simple or even complex three dimensional (3D) circuits, resorting to pressure driven extrusion of conductive filaments is considered. Future perspectives and potentiality of these emerging technologies for assembling sensors are also explored.", "This paper presents the autonomous control of a fully customized quadrotor MAV in UPS-denied environments based on onboard visual odometry. To achieve the best integration and efficiency, key modules of the MAV hardware system have been investigated and optimized iteratively, inclusive of mechanical frame, propulsion system, flight controller and the visual sensor. An optical-flow module is developed with the low-cost and small-scaled visual sensor as well as height estimation. In order to achieve real-time and high-accuracy position feedback, vision odometry is estimated based on pixel intensity block matching with rotational motions compensated. Subsequently, autonomous path tracking is achieved from the fusion of corresponding sensing feedback with proper design of a Kalman Filter.", "This work presents an experimental study of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel performance in the indoor radio propagation environment. Indoor channel measurements at the 2.4-GHz ISM frequency band have been conducted using a versatile channel sounder test-bed platform. A single transmitting antenna, four receiving antennas with two proposed geometries and a four-branch receiver circuitry were used in order to achieve channel sounder measurements exploiting baseband signal-processing techniques. In-depth investigation of SIMO wireless channel performance was realised through three types of metrics: signal strength, gain coefficient and capacity. Performance results indicate SIMO channel capacity enhancement and illustrate differences between the two proposed geometries.", "Open source communities rely on the espoused premise of complete openness and transparency of source code and development process. Yet, openness and transparency at times need to be balanced out with moments of less open and transparent work. Through our detailed study of Linux Kernel development, we build a theory that explains that transparency and openness are nuanced and changing qualities that certain developers manage as they use multiple digital technologies and create, in moments of needs, more opaque and closed digital spaces of work. We refer to these spaces as digital folds. Our paper contributes to the extant literature by providing a process theory of how transparency and openness are balanced with opacity and closure in open source communities according to the needs of the development work; by conceptualizing the nature of digital folds and their role in providing quiet spaces of work; and, by articulating how the process of digital folding and unfolding is made far more possible by select elite actors' navigating the line between the pragmatics of coding and the accepted ideology of openness and transparency.", "This work presents the City Dynamics and Smart Environment activities of the Smart Ring project, a model for the smart city, based on the integration of sustainable urban transport services and environmental monitoring over a 4-5-km circular path, the Smart Ring, around the historical center of l'Aquila (Italy). We describe our pilot experience performed during an experimental on-demand public service electric bus, SmartBus, which was equipped with a multi-parametric air quality low-cost gas electrochemical sensor platform, NASUS IV. For five days (28-29 August 2014 and 1-3 September 2014), the sensor platform was installed inside the SmartBus and measured air quality gas compounds (nitrogen dioxide, carbon oxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) during the service. Data were collected and analyzed on the bases of an air quality index, which provided qualitative insights on the air status potentially experienced by the users. The results obtained are in agreement with the synoptic meteorological conditions, the urban background air quality reference measurements and the potential traffic flow variations. Furthermore, they indicated that the air quality status was influenced by the gas component NO and CO. We discuss the features of our campaign, and we highlight the potential, limitations and key factors to consider for future project designs.", "This paper presents an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for precision forestry applications. The UAS is capable of performing fully autonomous flights under the canopies of an unknown plantation forest by avoiding obstacles without the use of GPS navigation. The navigation framework of this system consists of a velocity estimator and an obstacle avoidance controller. In particular, the velocity estimator estimates raw velocity measurements from the 2D laser scanner using the Point-to-Line Iterative Corresponding Point (PLICP) scan matching algorithm and then fuses the filtered raw velocity measurements with readings from other on-board sensors using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). A high-level obstacle avoidance controller is realized by creating a local artificial potential field near the UAS, based on the goal point and nearby obstacles. The performance of the UAS is quantified using indoor and outdoor tests. During the outdoor test, in which the UAS flew autonomously for approximately 28 m within a stand of trees, the minimum distance between the obstacles and UAS was 1.38 m.", "Remote monitoring and intelligent intervention of machines are essentials in a smart industrial environment. However, the heterogeneity of machines makes it difficult to construct solutions for this purpose.

At the heart of this vision is the citizen, who is the primary beneficiary of smart city initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six citizen-related challenges: the engagement of citizens, the improvement of citizens' data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services, and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a way of transferring insights and solutions from GIScience to smart cities.", "Biometric systems are important for access control and authentication in various application scenarios. Single biometrics can be selected for authentication, but a multimodal approach is typically more reliable. In this paper, a multimodal biometric authentication system is developed. It consists of wireless sensor nodes equipped with accelerometers and infrared cameras, which enable analysis of gait and vein scanning for authentication. Observed error equal rates for the gait and vein authentication are 13% and 11% respectively, whilst the equal error rate for the combined metrics is 8%.", "This paper addresses a new method for combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). Applying supervised learning in robot navigation encounters serious challenges such as inconsistent and noisy data, difficulty for gathering training data, and high error in training data. RL capabilities such as training only by one evaluation scalar signal, and high degree of exploration have encouraged researchers to use RL in robot navigation problem. However, RL algorithms are time consuming as well as suffer from high failure rate in the training phase. Here, we propose Supervised Fuzzy Sarsa Learning (SFSL) as a novel idea for utilizing advantages of both supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms. A zero order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller with some candidate actions for each rule is considered as the main module of robot's controller. The aim of training is to find the best action for each fuzzy rule. In the first step, a human supervisor drives an E-puck robot within the environment and the training data are gathered. In the second step as a hard tuning, the training data are used for initializing the value (worth) of each candidate action in the fuzzy rules. Afterwards, the fuzzy Sarsa learning module, as a critic-only based fuzzy reinforcement learner, fine tunes the parameters of conclusion parts of the fuzzy controller online. The proposed algorithm is used for driving E-puck robot in the environment with obstacles. The experiment results show that the proposed approach decreases the learning time and the number of failures; also it improves the quality of the robot's motion in the testing environments.

This paper focuses on a flight-test evaluation of navigation information in wide-field optical flow, using flight data collected by a wide-angle camera installed on a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle at altitudes ranging from 30 to 183m above the ground. A comprehensive evaluation methodology is proposed for the comparison between optical flows computed from videos and the reference motion fields determined from conventional navigation sensors including GPS, a laser range finder, and inertial sensors. Seven sets of unmanned aerial vehicle flight data including a total of approximately 72,000 image frames are used for both full-flight temporal evaluation and representative interframe spatial evaluation of wide-field optical flow information for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation purposes. The evaluation results showed a good match between vision-derived optical flows and reference motion fields from conventional navigation sensors. Finally, one benchmark data set is shared at the authors' website for open access from the research community.", "Energy consumption in battery operated mobile devices is a critical issue. Autonomy periods are increasingly compromised as the complexity of tasks, such as the widespread video decoding ones, is also increased. While new higher-capacity batteries are being developed, techniques to control, i.e. save, the energy consumption can provide a significant benefit. This paper presents the proposal, implementation and test of a real-time closed-loop control system applicable to the power-consumption regulation of multimedia mobile devices. The novel closed loop does not need any specific power sensor but only standard performance monitoring counters (PMCs) available in common mobile processors. From them, the power consumption is estimated with an algorithm to be included into the operating system, along with the control system itself. A theoretical system model has been first developed to (1) enable the design of some controllers and (2) validate the actual results obtained from the control system prototype into a given low-cost development board. These results prove the control-system stability and the comparative suitability of classic controllers to keep the multimedia-system consumption close to the desired value in steady state with settling times as short as a single sample interval(1).", "Dense optical flow is a crucial visual cue for obstacle avoidance and motion control for robotic systems functioning in complex unstructured environments. In order to compute image motion for modern highly dynamic robots, it is necessary to use high speed vision systems. To perceive small and thin objects such as tree branches, fence poles, and other similar objects, high resolution vision systems must be used. The data stream from a high-resolution, high-speed vision system will saturate the onboard data bus and overload the onboard processor of almost all existing robotic systems. To implement such a vision system, we believe it is necessary to process the data in situ at the camera using dedicated processing hardware, a vision processing paradigm that we term rapid embedded vision (REV) systems. Even then, the task of processing multiple hundred hertz of dense high-resolution images is not possible using classical algorithms and classical computing hardware. A new processing paradigm that actively exploits the high frame rate of the image sequences, and high performance computing hardware such as GPU or FPGA must be employed. This letter proposes a filtering algorithm for the computation of dense optical flow fields in real time. The filter is designed as a pyramidal structure of update and propagation loops, where an optical flow state is constantly refined with new image data from the camera. The computational properties of the proposed algorithm makes it well suited for implementation in GPU and FPGA systems. We present results from a GPU implementation achieving frame rates in the order of 800 Hz at VGA resolution. Experimental validation and comparison is provided for both synthetic and real life high speed video sequences at frame rates of 300 Hz and 1016 x 544 pixel resolution.", "The paper addresses the problem of distributed agreement for control of building thermal energy through a class of consensus algorithms. The context of the work is defined by the emergence of dense networked measurement and control systems and the cyberphysical paradigm in real world building energy management applications. This has occurred more saliently by means of wireless sensor network systems, offering integration of sensing, computing and actuation capabilities. Key point is mitigation of current model- and occupancy based strategies in order to increase building energy efficiency under a unifying framework. We consider both convergence and convergence speed conditions and relate our approach to the state-of-the-art. Simulation results are presented on a reference multiple thermal zone model.", "Many applications for robotic systems require the systems to traverse diverse, unstructured environments. State estimation with Visual Odometry (VO) in these applications is challenging because there is no single algorithm that performs well across all environments and situations. The unique trade-offs inherent to each algorithm mean different algorithms excel in different environments. We develop a method to increase robustness in state estimation by using an ensemble of VO algorithms. The method combines the estimates by dynamically switching to the best algorithm for the current context, according to a statistical model of VO estimate errors. The model is a Random Forest regressor that is trained to predict the accuracy of each algorithm as a function of different features extracted from the sensory input. We evaluate our method in a dataset of consisting of four unique environments and eight runs, totaling over 25min of data. Our method reduces the mean translational relative pose error by 3.5% and the angular error by 4.3% compared to the single best odometry algorithm. Compared to the poorest performing odometry algorithm, our method reduces the mean translational error by 39.4% and the angular error by 20.1%.", "This article develops the concept of \"smart velomobility\" that is concerned with networked practices, systems and technologies of cycling.

Averaging over biological, thermal and shot noise with 100's to 1000's of FOV enables unbiased quantitative analysis with high statistical power. Plotting average donor lifetime vs. acceptor/donor intensity ratio clearly identifies protein interactions and fitting to double exponential donor decay models provides estimates of interacting population fractions that, with calibrated donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities, can yield dissociation constants.

However, the prototyping of Tangible User Interfaces involves the integration of physical and virtual aspects, challenging both designers and developers, and hindering the rapid exploration of richer physical interactions with the game. Although the recent appearance of tabletop frameworks has helped to lower the threshold for coding tangible tabletop applications, the cost is a serious limitation on the degree of expressiveness of the tangible interaction. This paper presents \"ToyVision\", a software framework for the prototyping of tabletop games based on the manipulation of conventional playing pieces. ToyVision architecture is based on a Widget layer of abstraction that is able to express the manipulation of playing pieces in the context of the game. This Widget layer supports a wide range of passive and active manipulations with conventional objects. Designers and developers can visually model all passive and active manipulations involved in their game concepts in a Graphic Assistant, and test them immediately in a tabletop device. The paper also describes a set of evaluation sessions which demonstrate that ToyVision has been effective in lowering the threshold of developing applications for tabletop devices, while being sufficiently expressive to give support to innovative concepts for hybrid games that fully explore the tangible feasibilities of conventional playing pieces.", "Natural gas distribution systems play a fundamental role in delivering a primary energy resource toward industrial, tertiary and residential building.

In this paper, a prototypal monitoring and controlling systems has been implemented on the natural gas medium pressure grid feeding the city of Bari (Italy). Results prove that such an application can considerably upgrade the overall reliability and efficiency of the gas distribution process, also assuring the possibility of very fast interventions in case of leakage or breaking of pipes with predictable benefits in terms of personal safety and economic savings.", "Robots have been recently used as valuable therapeutic devices in numerous studies (especially with children with developmental needs), but their role as more general support for therapists is less well studied. However, as robots become better integrated in therapeutic environments, they will also influence therapists; and if robots are designed correctly, they could positively influence therapists' well-being. Understanding how robots could be used in such a way is especially important as therapists of autistic children (and therapists of mentally disabled people in general) have one of the highest risks of workplace burnout. This paper describes a series of studies conducted to understand therapists' attitudes towards robotic support and to discover what is most needed in such devices; this paper also describes an experimental study of the feasibility of robots playing one of those roles. Through observational studies and a series of ten meetings, with a group of seven therapists of autism, a list of possible roles was created. In a larger questionnaire based study, therapists gave a ranking to various robot roles and functions (a child's behaviour analyser and support in critical/dangerous situations were given the highest priority). Therapists also stated that they expect robots to help them in the workplace, help prepare documentation and make their work more systematic. In a Wizard-of-Oz type experimental study, a robot was used to play a role of \"emotional mirror\" with seven therapist-child pairs. Study participants stated that a robot was acceptable and was not disturbing, although most did not find it particularly useful. Our conclusions indicate that therapists want robots to play a larger role than just a therapeutic device, and such roles can be added to robots without disturbing sessions with clients.", "Busca, B, Morales, J, Solana-Tramunt, M, Miro, A, and Garcia, M. Effects of jaw clenching while wearing a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece on strength in healthy young men. J Strength Cond Res 30(4): 1102-1110, 2016-Recent studies have investigated the ergogenic effects of different types of mouthguards. There is evidence of the benefits of clenching customized mouthpieces on force and power development. The phenomenon called concurrent activation potentiation (CAP) promoted in jaw clenching seems to enhance the muscular strength and power in maximal isometric contractions and powerful actions in sport. Moreover, a bite-aligning mouthpiece may promote a more aligned and powerful clench. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of jaw clenching while wearing a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece (MP) on jump ability and isometric maximal strength tests in contrast to 2 other conditions: nonjaw clenching (NON-JAW) and jaw clenching without the mouthpiece (JAW). A within-subjects design was used to assess the jump performance and the maximal isometric force in 28 physically active male subjects. Statistical analyses revealed significantly higher performance in JAW and NON-JAW conditions for handgrip force (HG-peakforce) and all variables of the back-row exercise (BRW) and countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) (p <= 0.05). Significant differences between NON-JAW and JAW were found for HG-peakforce (p <= 0.05). These findings suggest that it is advisable to use a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece to improve strength and power performance.", "Ubiquitous cellular coverage is often taken for granted, yet numerous people live outside, or at the fringes, of commercial cellular coverage.

Some CAN networks now employ TDMA-based communication in order to help meet real-time constraints. Whilst this form of media access control brings several timeliness benefits, studies have also illustrated negative effects on transmission reliability; duplicated message instances can help to increase this reliability. In this paper a transmission window technique for CAN is proposed. A bounded amount of re-transmission is allowed for each message within this window, which can in many cases provides increased reliability in the presence of errors or bursts of errors. A probabilistic analysis of transmission windows is presented and used to develop a simple algorithm for calculating the optimal window size to achieve a specified statistical guarantee of message delivery. Stochastic simulations along with computational and empirical results are presented which validate the analysis, and indicate that in many circumstances the technique can potentially reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for specified reliability levels when compared to the use of message duplicates. Suggestions are also made to help increase the reliability of message duplications in error burst environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Position and Orientation System (POS), which is conventionally employed for locating and orienting MMS, allows direct georeferencing of spatial data in real-time. Since the performance of a POS depends on both the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), poor GNSS conditions, such as in long tunnels and underground, introduce the necessity for post-processing. In above-ground railways, mobile mapping technology is employed with high performance sensors for finite usage, which has considerable potential for enhancing railway safety and management in real-time. In contrast, underground railways present a challenge for a conventional POS thus alternative configurations are necessary to maintain data accuracy and alleviate the need for post-processing. This paper introduces a method of rail-bound navigation to replace the role of GNSS for railway applications. The proposed method integrates INS and track alignment data for environment-independent navigation and reduces the demand of post-processing. The principle of rail-bound navigation is presented and its performance is verified by an experiment using a consumer-grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a small-scale railway model. The method produced a substantial improvement in position and orientation for a poorly initialised system in centimetre positional accuracy. The potential improvements indicated by, and limitations of rail-bound navigation are also considered for further development in existing railway systems.", "Mobile learning (M-learning) represents a way to address a number of traditional, distance and electronic learning issues and limitations. Using mobile devices such as PDAs, tablets and smart phones as learning tools enable innovation and support learners, instructors, parents and decision makers accessing to digital material and personalised achievements assessment. Many research studies have been performed in M-learning related to its requirement analysis, design needs and application development issues and challenges. In order to ascertain the current knowledge and research state, an extensive review of M-learning literature and research background have been undertaken to pinpoint and harness potential factors and gaps in its implementation and adoption. This paper surveys the state of the art on the use and research of different aspects related to M-learning following a systematic methodology. The paper seeks in helping researchers to understand and distinguish the main characteristics and features surrounding M-learning in one solid article reviewed 169 selected articles. The effort is part of an Omani-funded research project investigating the development, adoption and dissemination of M-learning in Oman.", "The challenges in deploying robust wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in agricultural environments are limited power supply and variability of wireless propagation channel that restrict performance. Proposed protocols do not meet the challenges for realistic simulation and evaluation of WSN for agricultural applications. The design of LEACH protocol is, for the most part, efficient for many applications. It achieves energy efficiency through a clustering technique with TDMA based MAC layer algorithms and data aggregation method. Analysis performed shows that LEACH uses simple radio propagation and energy models that are unrealistic. This paper focuses on the performance analysis of LEACH protocol for agricultural environments.", "Here we present a novel bio-inspired optic flow (OF) sensor and its application to visual. guidance and odometry on a low-cost car-like robot called BioCarBot. The minimalistic OF sensor was robust to high-dynamic-range lighting conditions and to various visual patterns encountered thanks to its M(2)APIX auto-adaptive pixels and the new cross-correlation OF algorithm implemented. The low-cost car-like robot estimated its velocity and steering angle, and therefore its position and orientation, via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) using only two downward-facing OF sensors and the Ackerman steering model. Indoor and outdoor experiments were carried out in which the robot was driven in the closed-loop mode based on the velocity and steering angle estimates. The experimental results obtained show that our novel OF sensor can deliver high-frequency measurements (>300 Hz) in a wide OF range (1.5-15 rad s(-1)) and in a 7-decade high-dynamic light level range. The OF resolution was constant and could be adjusted as required (up to 0.05 rad s(-1)), and the OF precision obtained was relatively high (standard deviation of 0.17 rad s(-1) with an average OF of 4.5 rad s(-1), under the most demanding lighting conditions). An EKF-based algorithm gave the robot's position and orientation with a relatively high accuracy (maximum errors outdoors at a very low light level: 0.95 mand 0.58 rad over about 32 mand 8 pi rad) despite the low-resolution control systems of the steering servo and the DC motor, as well as a simplified model identification and calibration. Finally, the minimalistic OF-based odometry results were compared to those obtained using measurements based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a motor's speed sensor.", null, "Objective: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are an emerging platform for targeted diagnostics in cancer. An important component needed for translation of MNPs is the detection and quantification of targeted MNPs bound to tumor cells. Method: This study explores the feasibility of a multifrequency nonlinear magnetic spectroscopic method that uses excitation and pickup coils and is capable of discriminating between quantities of bound and unbound MNPs in 0.5 ml samples of KB and Igrov human cancer cell lines. The method is tested over a range of five concentrations of MNPs from 0 to 80 mu g/ml and five concentrations of cells from 50 to 400 000 count per ml. Results: A linear model applied to the magnetic spectroscopy data was able to simultaneously measure bound and unbound MNPs with agreement between the model-fit and lab assay measurements (p < 0.001). The detectable iron of the presented method to bound and unbound MNPs was < 2 mu g in a 0.5 ml sample. The linear model parameters used to determine the quantities of bound and unbound nanoparticles in KB cells were also used to measure the bound and unbound MNP in the Igrov cell line and vice versa. Conclusion: Nonlinear spectroscopic measurement of MNPs may be a useful method for studying targeted MNPs in oncology. Significance: Determining the quantity of bound and unbound MNP in an unknown sample using a linear model represents an exciting opportunity to translate multifrequency nonlinear spectroscopy methods to in vivo applications where MNPs could be targeted to cancer cells.", "Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major threat to human health, but broad-spectrum antibiotics are losing efficacy. There is a need to screen a given drug against a bacterial infection outside of the laboratory. To address this need, we have designed and built an inexpensive and easy-to-use 3D-printer-based system that allows easily readable quantitative tests for the performance of antibacterial drugs. The platform creates a sterile diagnostic device by using 3D printing, and the device is filled automatically with growth medium, and then antibiotics are sprayed onto the medium by ink-jet technology. The sample for testing can be introduced via a fluid port, and the printer hot bed is used to incubate the device, allowing operation in the field. Combining advantages from various established tests of antibacterial performance, this allows the comparison of a specific antibiotics and bacteria. Also, this system can create and test several antibiotic formulations for therapeutic use, and we demonstrate this potential by investigating a mixture of pathogens that are only killed by a mixture of drugs.", ["Purpose - This paper aims to examine the dynamics of a community of practice (CoP) through a case study of eCars - Now! They offer open- source blueprints of the electric conversion kits globally. The authors analysed the CoP by considering its entire life cycle, starting from the motives for its establishment, through its active performance, up to the current stage, where the members need to decide whether the community will remain viable. Particular attention was paid to the group dynamics and issues that seemed relevant to the change in dynamics which determine whether a CoP maintains its vitality or dissipates.", "Design/methodology/approach - The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy (Yin, 1984) to answer the research question and understand the target phenomenon of the CoP by analysing textual data. This particular case was chosen because of its unusual revelatory value for the case CoP which aims at creating a tangible innovation by using a platform that normally aims at intangible problem- solving (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). In the data collection, the authors used method and researcher triangulation (Patton, 1990).", "Findings - Life cycle analysis revealed four themes that explained the change in the group dynamics and the dispersal of the community: differentiation and dispersal of interests, growth that resulted in role differentiation, virtuality in community development and inclusion of investors. The themes were all related to the fact that the case community operated with not only knowledge, but also with a tangible product. Therefore, the tangibility of a problem to be solved seems to play a pivotal role in a CoP's operations and dynamics and, in part, also explains the changing role of information and communications technology (ICT) in the process.", "Research limitations/implications - However, this paper identified also different ways to characterize community participation, which was also relevant from group dynamics point of view. Thus, the topic should be studied further. Group dynamics in general, as it relates to the success of CoPs, should be also investigated further. Additional studies should implement the inclusion of external resources in the community. Further research is also needed to investigate tangible and intangible outcomes achieved through CoPs. Much of the available research was conducted over short periods; prolonged interactions in a CoP context could show different results.", "Practical implications - In conclusion, at the beginning of the life cycle of the eCars community, ICT played a significant role. It helped increase awareness of the community in the first place and enabled people to join in, which thus enabled the community to evolve. When the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became emphasized and much more important. In the maturing stage, the role of ICT, and especially social media, is the essential part of the community.", "Social implications - This analysis suggests that at the early stage of a community, the plans can be somewhat random, even utopian, but when the community evolves, this uncertainty can become a problem. First, it affects achieving the actual, and in this case, concrete results. Second, uncertainty and unclarity dampen enthusiasm and motivation, which are of utmost importance due to the voluntary participation. This paper also concludes that when the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became increasingly important.", "Originality/value - This paper argues that the ideological basis for this kind of community should be openness. All information should be available for everyone who registers to the community platform on the internet. This community was working in the mindset of open innovation. Technical documentation and all other material were available for everyone in the community's wiki pages, which attracted a lot of people who were delighted by eCars. Many advisors delivered technical information and good advice to the practitioners of the community through the platform. The hang arounds were also very well-informed in this stage regarding how the core group was working."], "We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry. Here we describe the implementation and performance of the method on a hovering robot equipped with eight 0.65 g optic-flow sensors, and show that it can be used for closed-loop control of various motions.", "The present work studies the effect of three insect-proof screens with different geometrical and aerodynamic characteristics on the air velocity and temperature inside a Mediterranean multi-span greenhouse with three roof vents and without crops, divided into two independent sectors. First, the insect-proof screens were characterised geometrically by analysing digital images and testing in a low velocity wind tunnel. The wind tunnel tests gave screen discharge coefficient values of C-d,C-phi of 0.207 for screen 1 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 35.0%), 0.151 for screen 2 (13 x 30 threads.cm(-2); phi = 26.3%) and 0.325 for screen 3 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 36.0%), at an air velocity of 0.25 m.s(-1). Secondly, when screens were installed in the greenhouse, we observed a statistical proportionality between the discharge coefficient at the openings and the air velocity u(i) measured in the centre of the greenhouse, u(i) = 0.856 C-d + 0.062 (R-2 = 0.68 and p-value = 0.012). The inside-outside temperature difference Delta T-io diminishes when the inside velocity increases following the statistically significant relationship Delta T-io = (-135.85 + 57.88/u(i))(0.5) (R-2 = 0.85 and p-value = 0.0011). Different thread diameters and tension affects the screen thickness, and means that similar porosities may well be associated with very different aerodynamic characteristics. Screens must be characterised by a theoretical function C-d,C-phi = [(2e mu/K-p rho).(1/u(s)) + (2eY/K(p)0.5)](-0.5) that relates the discharge coefficient of the screen C-d,C-phi with the air velocity us. This relationship depends on the three parameters that define the aerodynamic behaviour of porous medium: permeability K-p, inertial factor Y and screen thickness e (and on air temperature that determine its density rho and viscosity mu). However, for a determined temperature of air, the pressure drop-velocity relationship can be characterised only with two parameters: Delta P = au(s)(2) + bu(s).", "The advent of microfluidics has enabled thorough control of cell manipulation experiments in so called lab on chips. Lab on chips foster the integration of actuation and detection systems, and require minute sample and reagent amounts. Typically employed microfluidic structures have similar dimensions as cells, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of individual cells and their local environments. Several strategies for high spatio-temporal control of cells in microfluidics have been reported in recent years, namely methods relying on careful design of the microfluidic structures (e.g. pinched flow), by integration of actuators (e.g. electrodes or magnets for dielectro-, acousto- and magneto-phoresis), or integrations thereof. This review presents the recent developments of cell experiments in microfluidics divided into two parts: an introduction to spatial control of cells in microchannels followed by special emphasis in the high temporal control of cell-stimulus reaction and quenching. In the end, the present state of the art is discussed in line with future perspectives and challenges for translating these devices into routine applications.", "Virtual platforms have become essential tools for the design of embedded systems. Developers rely on them for design space exploration and software debugging. However, with rising HW/SW complexity and the need to simulate more and more processors simultaneously, the performance of virtual platforms degrades rapidly. Parallel simulation techniques can help to counter this by leveraging multicore PCs, which are widely available today. This work presents a novel parallel simulation approach that is targeted toward acceleration of virtual platforms from the ESL domain. By trading some timing accuracy, multiprocessor virtual platforms can be accelerated by up to 3.4x on regular quad-core workstations.", "This position paper critically analyses the process to implement the UNESCO Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape (2011), exploring evaluation tools, innovative business/management models and financing tools for the conservation and regeneration of Historic Urban Landscape (HUL), to make it operational in the perspective of a circular economy model of sustainable development for city/territory system regeneration. Through evaluation tools, it is possible to pass from general principles to operational practices; to produce empirical evidence of the economic, social and environmental benefits of HUL integrated conservation and regeneration. The challenge of generating a symbiosis between conservation and transformation issues requires adequate evaluation methods, business, management and financing tools, engaging civil society and local stakeholders, capturing both HUL tangible and intangible values to turn the historic urban landscape into a driver of sustainable growth. The analysis carried out in this paper shows that through the suggested tools it is possible to make operational the UNESCO Recommendations, transforming conflicts into opportunities, producing economic attractiveness and strengthen social awareness and cohesion.", "Grand challenges are among the most complex problems for modern societies. Many governments and foundations provide substantial resources to encourage the search for solutions. Due to the significance of these problems, organizations often form partnerships in what we call search consortia to engage in joint search and compete for funding. Prior research on joint search highlights the role of specialized organizations, mainly regarding technological domains, to identify a superior solution. However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders. In this study, we suggest that search consortia are more likely to receive funding when they include representatives of stakeholder concerns, so-called advocacy groups. We extend theory on coordinated exploration in joint search by integrating mechanisms from stakeholder theory and argue that advocacy groups improve the generation of potential solutions and provide legitimacy. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 35,249 consortia that proposed solutions to 2,349 grand challenge problems as part of a large European funding program. Our results show that advocacy groups benefit search consortia, particularly when consortia exhibit a high dispersion of technological knowledge and when they are inexperienced.", "Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV)' s applications on reconnaissance, mapping and even recreation have a flourishing blossom these years, which give rise to the requirement of sense accuracy. To overcome the limitation on accuracy and avoid the degradation during GPS signal dropouts due to the environment (indoor situations for example), innovative types of sensors and data fusion strategies and techniques are involved. Whilst one of the most commonly used strategies is to blend optical flow camera and GPS/IMU integration with extended Kalman filter (EKF), the vision-based methods like vision SLAM become prevalent. Then the clash on compatibility for different category of sensors with distinct format and report rate can be the main drawback for current fusion algorithm. In this paper, we propose a graphical fusion approach that is able to estimate the optimal performance from all the sensors in a more smooth and compatible way. Enlightened by graph-based SLAM, a novel structure of factor graph is introduced to encode sensor measurement. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the graph-based fusion compared with two other classic methods.", "This paper introduces a novel technique for fabricating functional robots using 3D printers.

The importance of protecting employee health and fitness data will grow exponentially in the future. This is the moment for a robust discussion of how law can better protect employees from the potential misuse of their health data. While scholars have just begun to examine the problem of health data privacy, this Article contributes to the academic literature in three important ways. First, it analyzes the convergence of three trends resulting in an unprecedented growth of health-related data: the Internet of Things, the Quantified Self movement, and the Rise of Health Platforms. Second, it describes the insufficiencies of specific data privacy laws and federal agency actions in the context of protecting employee health data from employer misuse. Finally, it provides two detailed and workable solutions for remedying the current lack of protection of employee health data that will realign employer use with reasonable expectations of health and fitness privacy. The Article proceeds in four Parts. Part I describes the growth of self-monitoring apps, devices, and other sensor-enabled technology that can monitor a wide range of data related to an employee's health and fitness and the relationship of this growth to both the Quantified Self movement and the Internet of Things. Part II explains the increasing use of employee monitoring through a wide range of sensors, including wearable devices, and the potential uses of that health and fitness data. Part III explores the various regulations and agency actions that might protect employees from the potential misuse of their health and fitness data and the shortcomings of each. Part IV proposes two specific measures that would help ameliorate the ineffective legal protections that currently exist in this context. In order to improve employee notice of and control over the disclosure of their health data, I recommend the adoption of a mandatory privacy labeling law for health-related devices and apps to be enacted and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As a complementary measure, I also recommend that be amended so that its protections extend to the health-related data that employers may acquire about their employees. The Article concludes with suggestions for additional scholarly discussion.", "The last decade witnessed a tremendous increase in popularity and usage of social network services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Moreover, advances in Web technologies coupled with social networks has enabled users to not only access, but also generate, content in many forms. The overwhelming amount of produced content and resulting network traffic gives rise to precarious scalability issues for social networks, such as handling a large number of users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, and data storage. There are few surveys conducted to explore the different dimensions of social networks, such as security, privacy, and data acquisition. Most of the surveys focus on privacy or security-related issues and do not specifically address scalability challenges faced by social networks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study of social networks along with their significant characteristics and categorize social network architectures into three broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) hybrid. We also highlight various scalability issues faced by social network architectures. Finally, a qualitative comparison of presented architectures is provided, which is based on various scalability metrics, such as availability, latency, interserver communication, cost of resources, and energy consumption, just to name a few.", "This paper presents the design and implementation detail of an advanced mini quadrotor system, including the low cost commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics and advanced control algorithm. The proposed quadrotor has a gross takeoff weight of 758 g and 360mm frame diagonal size. It is capable of semi-autonomous maneuver in GPS denied environments, solely relying on onboard sensors and computers. A globally defined quadrotor model is formularized, and a nonlinear velocity tracking controller is implemented on the special Euclidean group SE(3). An optical flow and ultrasonic-based onboard downward-facing camera is used as the primary sensor to provide velocity and altitude measurement feedback for the controller. The control and sensor fusion algorithm is developed under Arduino compatible open source electronics.", "We present a framework for vision based localization for two or more multirotor aerial vehicles relative to each other. This collaborative localization technique is built upon a relative pose estimation strategy between two or more cameras with the capability of estimating accurate metric poses between each other even through fast motion and continually changing environments. Through synchronized feature detection and tracking with a robust outlier rejection process, classical multiple view geometry concepts have been utilized for obtaining scale-ambiguous relative poses, which are then refined through reconstruction and pose optimization to provide a metric estimate. Furthermore, we present the implementation details of this technique followed by a set of results which involves evaluation of the accuracy of the pose estimates through test cases in both simulated and real experiments. Test cases include keeping one camera stationary as the other is mounted on a quadrotor which is then flown through various types of trajectories. We also perform a quantitative comparison with a GPS/IMU localization technique to demonstrate the accuracy of our method.", "This work proposed a motion estimation method for a flexible robotic manipulator with a vision-based end-effector. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation method was evaluated by utilizing a non-linear dynamic model of a flexible manipulator using the co-rotational finite element method. This modeling utilized multiple co-ordinate (co-rotational) systems which rotated and translated with each element, allowing the investigation of flexible manipulator dynamics with the large rotational and translational motion. Smart piezoelectric sensors, embedded to the flexible manipulator, were used for vibration sensing purposes. Simulation results on a flexible manipulator demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed estimation method in predicting the movement of end-effector with a satisfactory accuracy. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the estimation method. Results from the vision analysis, based on experimental results, demonstrated the feasibility of the estimation method for a further flexible manipulator application with the eye-in-hand system.", null, "Conventional heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems usually achieve the desired control level by means of simple ON-OFF control, which can often result in high energy wastage. A potential solution to this issue is intelligent self-regulating HVAC controllers, which base their actions/decisions on sensor data. In this paper, an office climate monitoring and control system is designed and implemented. The system consists of various wireless sensor nodes and a control node. The sensor nodes provide the sensor data necessary to determine occupancy and the control node executes the algorithm, which decides whether to activate cooling or heating based on the sensor data. This system can serve as a controller and can be integrated into HVAC systems in smart buildings. It is shown that the developed control algorithm executed on the control node results in an improvement of up to 39% in energy efficiency over conventional ON-OFF controllers for HVAC systems.", "The exponential growth of popularity of multimedia has led to needs for user-centric adaptive applications that manage multimedia content more effectively. Implicit analysis, which examines users' perceptual experience of multimedia by monitoring physiological or behavioral cues, has potential to satisfy such demands. Particularly, physiological signals categorized into cerebral physiological signals (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and peripheral physiological signals (heart rate, respiration, skin temperature, etc.) have recently received attention along with notable development of wearable physiological sensors.

However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.", ["Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt.", "In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale.

The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype.

The proposed Raspberry Pi-Arduino-based model architecture ensures lower cost while allowing some scalability, inter operability, portability and interchangeability to the low-cost online laboratory. Remotely controlled lab provides training skills in bio-inspired robotics. Our previous studies had shown that the implementation of remotely controlled online labs in the curriculum improved active learning among students, collaboration, and augmented problem solving skills. The preliminary implementation involved proprietary software, as the remote experiment accessibility platform, which was later replaced with FOSS technology. The advantages with FOSS included a significantly lower cost and se:liability for concurrent usage.

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.", "Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Then the operation and use of free and open source software are detailed to meet the needs of open hardware innovators. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach with 3-D printing. The results showed how the Free Inactive Patent Search enables users to search using plain language text to find public domain concepts and then provides a hyperlinked list of ideas that takes users to the USPTO database for the patent for more information.

This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a \"how-to\" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.", "The aim of this paper is to introduce a plug-and-play mechanism for an Internet of Things (IoT) device to instantiate a Software as a Service (SaaS) application in a private cloud, built up with OpenStack.

In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization.

The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform.

One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework; yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware, component-based robotics is still in its early stages.

In particular, the ideal of hacking as developed through studies of free and open source (F/OS) has highlighted the value of processes of participation, including participatory governance, in relation to the value of expanded accessibility of knowledge, including knowledge commons. Yet, these means and ends are often conflated. This article employs three examples of projects where hacker-inspired perspectives on scientific knowledge conflict with institutional perspectives. Each example develops differently the relationships between means and ends in relation to authority and legitimacy. The article's analysis suggests that while hacker culture's focus on authority through participation has had great traction in business and in public interest science, this may come limit the contribution to knowledge in the public interest - especially knowledge commons.", "Modern industry requires an improved motor performance and the permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motors are especially appropriate for applications that require a high level of accuracy and performance.

The appearance of new urban places for technological innovation is reviving the ageing industrial processes of this manufacturing city. It is supposed to transform Shenzhen into the Silicon Valley of hardware. Two groups, one local, the shanzhai community made up of entrepreneurs and companies historically based on a strategy of imitating highend products, and the other, a more international maker community, are thought to be the main drivers of this change using values of 'open innovation'. The building of this ecosystem relies largely on practices associated with being open-source. Like in California, open innovation contributed to the creation of resources for the development of a vast high-tech industry. This ethnographic field study shows how, while both communities, the international makers and the shanzhai, draw on open innovation, they do not have the same values. For the shanzhai, open innovation means total deregulation and a kind of coopetition that poorly masks fierce competition. For the makers, open innovation does not entirely eliminate the classic tension between 'open' and 'closed' commons in the world of makers. These two communities still rarely collaborate.", "Citizen science is increasingly being used in diverse research domains.

However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems.

The implemented system has three major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU) - consisting of a pair of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors, a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed, the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to enhance the system efficiency from 83.1% to 94.5% without any additional hardware.

For achieving those applications, the UAVs have to be equipped with an accurate attitude detection and localization module to maintain a stable attitude and a correct heading direction during flight. This paper reports the implementation of an attitude detection and localization module for UAVs by integrating sensing data from the GPS sensor, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and digital compass. The module is realized based on the Arduino platform to compute the fused attitude and localization information and send the fused data to the ground station computer in real time.

In the development of helmet, we have considered the three main types of hazard such as air quality, helmet removal, and collision (miners are struck by an object). The first is the concentration level of the hazardous gases such as CO, SO2, NO2, and particulate matter. The second hazardous event was classified as a miner removing the mining helmet off their head. An IR sensor was developed unsuccessfully but an off-the shelf IR sensor was then used to successfully determine when the helmet is on the miner's head. The third hazardous event is defined as an event where miners are struck by an object against the head with a force exceeding a value of 1000 on the HIC (Head Injury Criteria). An accelerometer was used to measure the acceleration of the head and the HIC was calculated in software. The layout of the visualisation software was completed, however the implementation was unsuccessful. Tests were successfully done to calibrate the accelerometer.

Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector.

Through site visits and interviews at makerspaces and similar facilities across the UK, we have identified additional roles that these spaces play: as social spaces, in supporting wellbeing, by serving the needs of the communities they are located in and by reaching out to excluded groups. Based on these findings, we suggest implications and future directions for both makerspace organisers and community researchers.", "The drift of inertial navigation system (INS) will lead to large navigation error when a low-cost INS is used in microaerial vehicles (MAV). To overcome the above problem, an INS/optical flow/magnetometer integrated navigation scheme is proposed for GPS-denied environment in this paper. The scheme, which is based on extended Kalman filter, combines INS and optical flow information to estimate the velocity and position of MAV. The gyro, accelerator, and magnetometer information are fused together to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is at static state or uniformly moving state; and the gyro only is used to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is accelerating or decelerating. The MAV flight data is used to verify the proposed integrated navigation scheme, and the verification results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the errors of navigation parameters and improve navigation precision.", "In this chapter we will show how modern FPGA offers the possibility of implementing Reconfigurable Virtual Instrumentation, a new kind of electronic instrumentation which generates interesting opportunities for regular users but that also poses several technical challenges for advanced users and instrument developers. We will analyze some of the main problems and we will give some ideas and possible strategies to deal with them. In order to put the subject in the right context we will review some general concepts regarding instrumentation in general and we later proceed with some more specific concepts and definitions. The chapter also describes two hardware/software platforms for science and high-education developed at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) where the concept of RVI proposed in this chapter was applied. Although we mainly adopt a scientist's prospective to define and analyze instrumentation, most of the conclusions drawn along this chapter can be easily generalized for a wide range of applications in commercial or industrial sectors.", "Health monitoring involves sensing, reporting, and sometimes adjusting the states of objects or nodes remotely. This paper describes the design and implementation of a real-time distributed hardware health monitoring framework, assuming a homogeneous set of hardware nodes. The framework consists of sensor components operating at the nodes, and visualization components operating at monitoring stations. A service-oriented software architecture naturally lends itself to fit such a framework. As the primary focus and case study, the paper presents the implementation of a system to monitor the status of a collection of computers, where the sensors are hardware probes and counters such as CPU probes and performance counters.", "Biological processes are inherently multi-scale, and supramolecular complexes at the nanoscale determine changes at the cellular scale and beyond. Single-molecule localizationmicroscopy (SMLM)(1-3) techniques have been established as important tools for studying cellular features with resolutions of the order of around 10 nm. However, in their current form these modalities are limited by a highly constrained field of view (FOV) and field-dependent image resolution. Here, we develop a low-cost microlens array (MLA)-based epi-illumination system-flat illumination for field-independent imaging (FIFI)-that can efficiently and homogeneously perform simultaneous imaging of multiple cells with nanoscale resolution. The optical principle of FIFI, which is an extension of the Kohler integrator, is further elucidated and modelled with a new, free simulation package. We demonstrate FIFI's capabilities by imaging multiple COS-7 and bacteria cells in 100 x 100 mu m(2) SMLM images-more than quadrupling the size of a typical FOV and producing near-gigapixel-sized images of uniformly high quality.", "Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and loT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudloT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudloT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudloT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudloT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms - both proprietary and open source - and projects implementing the CloudloT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The actor model defines a concurrent system where the individual unit of computation is the actor and communication between components is handled through a message passing interface. Pystation is an actor framework written in Python that implements a message-passing scheme where each actor has the ability to communicate with local actors or actors across a network. This paper describes some historical and background information on the actor model followed by details of its implementation and examples of use at a ground station. GNU Radio is utilized as the software for physical layer and signal processing, allowing for a highly robust and flexible ground station that can be altered without tedious hardware modifications. The purpose of this framework is to provide the software foundation to the Virginia Tech Ground Station (VTGS) in order to increase reliability and flexibility. The Virginia Tech Ground Station project is meant to serve as a ground station operations and communications sandbox for educational activities, such as student labs and space-based research projects.", "In the actual era of smart homes and smart grids, advanced technological systems that allow the automation of domestic tasks are developing rapidly.

However, the tools used to program them require detailed manipulation and understanding of low-level knitting operations. We present a compiler that can automatically turn assemblies of high-level shape primitives (tubes, sheets) into low-level machine instructions. These high-level shape primitives allow knit objects to be scheduled, scaled, and otherwise shaped in ways that require thousands of edits to low-level instructions. At the core of our compiler is a heuristic transfer planning algorithm for knit cycles, which we prove is both sound and complete. This algorithm enables the translation of high-level shaping and scheduling operations into needle-level operations. We show a wide range of examples produced with our compiler and demonstrate a basic visual design interface that uses our compiler as a backend.", "Agriculture has nurtured the development of human civilizations through the ages. Yet it is one of the many fields which is in dire need of technological intervention. Latest technologies like the \"infrastructure of information society\" Internet of Things are yet to reach the Agriculture market. This is especially so in the case of less affluent countries like India where agriculture is still a gamble for the farmer. By implementing intelligent monitoring techniques and enabling automatic sensing of the conditions on a farm, the farmer can ensure that the best possible practices are used in her/his farm and thus ensure maximum productivity and yield. The paper discusses a cost effective system that receives data about the conditions surrounding the plants from various sensors in the system. The sensors used are DHT-11, SHT-11 and a 'Height Measuring Apparatus' consisting of magnetic switches on a vertical pipe and a Neodymium magnet piece. The data \"compiled\" are the current height of the plant, the moisture content in the soil, the temperature of the soil, the atmospheric temperature and relative humidity. The system sends notifications to the farmer at regular intervals. The actions taken by the farmer upon receiving the processed data is also recorded. The corresponding effects on the plant growth are then \"detected\". This process can make the farmers aware of the impact their actions have on the plants, giving them an analysis about both the needs of the plant as well as the \"fruit\" of their actions.", "Despite successful pilots in developing countries, TVWS (Television White Spaces, unused portions of television broadcasting spectrum) has not gained the amount of attention that it deserves. One of the reasons is the lack of spectrum measurements that would convince the regulators about the abundance of idle spectrum. Spectrum measurements traditionally require expensive instruments and considerable operator's expertise. This has changed with the emergence of low cost spectrum analyzers and smartphones. In this paper we present RFTrack, a software suite that consists of an Android application and a TVWS analysis server. Together, they measure spectrum using a low-cost spectrum analyzer and geotag the data using the phone's internal GPS. The Android application is very easy to use and campaigns can be carried out by non-technical users. Once an Internet connection is available, the program sends data to the server that performs the required processes to present the results in an easy-to-understand way, also allowing for some user customization. The system has been used in eleven countries. We present the results from a measurement campaign in Costa Rica. We believe that this is a useful tool to demonstrate the existence of underutilized spectrum, especially in rural areas of developing countries.", "This paper presents a method that can detect driver's drowsiness by using the wavelet packet transform (WPT) and functional link-based fuzzy neural network (FLFNN) models. Drowsy drivers have been reported to be vulnerable to car accidents. Early detection of drowsiness can help alert drivers or passengers to provide a safety drive on the road. For those old models or cars without equipped with advanced high technologies, there is a dire need to install sensor devices that can effectively detect drowsy status of drivers at an early stage. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique that measures relative blood volume changes in the blood vessels and has been universally used for research and physiological study. We develop such PPG sensor devices to be installed on the steering wheel to detect the physiological conditions (such as normal to drowsy) by using parameters extracted from the heart rate variability (HRV) obtained from PPG signal calculation. Experimental results revealed that the proposed model is effective in assessing the drowsy levels of drivers.", "The present study presents a new rendering algorithm for a moving tactile stroke on the palm of the hand placed on a sparse 2D tactor array. Our algorithm utilizes the relation between signal duration and signal onset asynchrony previously proposed for \"tactile brush\" [1], but extends it by applying 3-actuator phantom sensations and adjusting the sampling rate. We compare our proposed algorithm to the tactile brush algorithm for their similarity in target trajectories and uniformity of tactile stroke motions. The results show that the participants judge the tactile strokes with our algorithm to move significantly closer to target motions and with more uniform velocity than the \"tactile brush.\" The effect of our algorithm is more significant for experimental stimuli with longer travel time and length.", "Adoption of a model-based development attitude can benefit the design of distributed embedded controllers, allowing adequate support for designer's needs integrating reusability of already available components, as well as design automation tools. Selection of Petri nets as reference modeling formalism provides support for a comprehensive specification and documentation of the system, complementing graphical expressiveness with formal verification capabilities. A Petri nets based development flow targeted for the design of distributed embedded controllers and cyber-physical systems is presented. Input-Output Place-Transition Petri nets (IOPT nets) are used as the underlying formalism, allowing explicit representation of dependencies on input and output signals and events (as common whenever generation of code for controllers is foreseen). Distributed execution is addressed adding the concept of time domains and communication channels to IOPT nets. The IOPT-Tools tool chain framework supports the whole development process from specification to implementation, including tools for model edition, simulation, properties verification, and automatic code generation targeting for deployment into specific implementation platforms (where VHDL coding is used for hardware-based implementation and C coding is selected for software-oriented implementation).", "This Article identifies a profound, ongoing shift in the modern administrative state: from the regulation of things to the regulation of code. This shift has and will continue to place previously isolated agencies in an increasing state of overlap, raising the likelihood of inconsistent regulations and putting seemingly disparate policy goals, like privacy, safety, environmental protection, and copyright enforcement, in tension. This Article explores this problem through a series of case studies and articulates a taxonomy of code regulations to help place hardware-turned-code rules in context. The Article considers the likely turf wars, regulatory thickets, and related dynamics that are likely to arise, and closes by considering the benefits of creating a new agency with some degree of centralized authority over software regulation issues.", "This paper investigates and demonstrates the potential for very long endurance autonomous aerial sensing and mapping applications with AtlantikSolar, a small-sized, hand-launchable, solar-powered fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. The platform design as well as the on-board state estimation, control and path-planning algorithms are overviewed. A versatile sensor payload integrating a multi-camera sensing system, extended on-board processing and high-bandwidth communication with the ground is developed. Extensive field experiments are provided including publicly demonstrated field-trials for search-and-rescue applications and long-term mapping applications. An endurance analysis shows that AtlantikSolar can provide full-daylight operation and a minimum flight endurance of 8 h throughout the whole year with its full multi-camera mapping payload. An open dataset with both raw and processed data is released and accompanies this paper contribution.", "The material foundations of computer systems and interactive technology is a topic that gained an increased interest within the HCI community during the last years. In this paper we discuss this topic through the Japanese concept of Wabi-Sabi, a philosophy that embraces three basic realities of the material world: 'nothing lasts', 'nothing is finished', and 'nothing is perfect'. We use these concepts to reflect on four unique interactive artefacts, which all in different ways embrace aspects of Wabi-Sabi, in terms of their design gestalt, materiality, but also in terms of use practices. Further, we use our analysis to articulate three high-level principles that may help addressing the long-term realities faced in physical interaction design, and for the design of interactive systems in general.", "South Africa could potentially face a shortage of water in the near future.

Unfortunately, PCB design for embedded and robotic systems is still a tedious and time consuming activity. In this paper, we present a technique, Just In Time Printed Circuit Board (JITPCB) for designing PCB systems at speeds commensurate with the capability of desktop PCB milling machines. We propose designing boards by writing software circuit generators that wire together and lay out circuit components in a hierarchical and reusable fashion. We have developed a declarative design mechanism allowing users to specify desired input and output peripherals and well as application code. Given this input, our system produces a complete working circuit board design, along with necessary initialization and networking code. Our system is an open framework that allows users to create a set of highly reusable parametric hardware/software modules. We demonstrate our approach by showing some common robotics applications designed with JITPCB to show its utility and generality.", ["Micro-controllers such as Arduino are widely used by all kinds of makers worldwide.

We show how ASIP enables the rapid development of non-trivial applications (coordination of input/output on distributed boards and implementation of a line-following algorithm for a remote robot) and we assess the performance of ASIP in several ways, both quantitative and qualitative.

Integrated manufacturing systems implemented have their management for programmable logic controllers and electrical interconnections, control logic and satisfactory robustness, but they do not attend the needs of diversity and flexibility in production. The solutions to these needs refer the company to migrate to the use of new technologies of control, circuit and logic. However, for an industry migrates is a very big and expensive step. Then, there is an urgent need for methods that implement the interface between logic controllers and multi-agent systems in order to evolve an integrated manufacturing system taking advantage of all electrical circuitry, control logic and the logic controller that installs itself, taking advantage of the self-adapting characteristics that the multi-agent systems provide.

It is hard to imagine a \"different\" Internet, but the character of the Internet as we experience it today is, in fact, contingent on key decisions made in the past by its designers, those who have invested in it, and those who have regulated it. With different choices, we might have a very different Internet today. This paper uses past choices made during the emergence of the early Internet as a lens to look toward its future, which is equally contingent on decisions being made today: by industry, by governments, by users, and by the research community. This paper identifies some of those key choices, and discusses alternative futures for the Internet, including how open, how diverse, how funded, and how protective of the rights of its users it may be.", "Due to low precision and weak stability, MEMS micro inertial navigation system installed in MAV cannot work alone and achieve high-performance navigation for a long time. In order to improve MEMS performance, it is proposed to fuse MEMS-IMU information with optical flow, and correct MEMS attitude when it is diverged. Then, image coordinate of optical flow is proposed to be firstly transformed to body one for better vehicle attitude calculation. The Allan variances of MEMS sensors are used in KF filter to replace the regular white noise. The algorithm is finally testified by simulation results, which is shown that vehicle attitude modified by combining with optical flow is of good performance, with smaller error, slow divergence and better robustness.

This paper oilers a reflexive-interventionist approach that simultaneously takes seriously the critiques of making's claims as technosolutionist while also embracing its utopian project as worth reconstituting in broader sociopolitical terms. It applies anthropological theory of the global and feminist-utopianism to the analysis of findings from research on making cultures in Taiwan and China. More specifically, the paper provides ethnographic snippets of utopian glimmers in order to speculatively imagine and explore alternative futures of making worth pursuing, and in so doing reconstitute the utopian vision of making.", "This study was undertaken to establish basic technologies and knowledge of aerial photography and its application to support safe rowing. For the water sport of rowing, managers and coaches use a motorboat to follow a rowing boat for coaching and safe rowing observation. Utilization of a motorboat gives rise to numerous problems in terms of pulled waves, narrow visual ranges, limited tracking of boats at any one time, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs. Moreover, rowing boats present collision risks to other rowing boats or obstacles floating on water, especially for a cox-less rowing boat because the visual direction for rowers is opposite to the moving direction. The aim of this study is to actualize rowing aerial photography using a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV): a radio-controlled small multi-rotor helicopter that has become popularly used for numerous applications recently. We obtained rowing movies using three-camera compositional patterns with changing altitudes and tilt angles. We examined the benefits of rowing aerial photography compared with movies obtained from a motorboat with consideration of safety improvement.", "Large spacecraft missions have both technical and financial needs.

This article explores the role of free software in the practices of digital artists, animators and technicians who work in various roles for the contemporary digital visual media industries. Rather than discussing it as a model of organising work, the study conceives free software as a production tool and shows how it becomes a locus of politics about finding material security in flexible capitalism. This politics is ultimately contradictory in that it extends creative and craft autonomy of digital artists but does not mobilise a critical project. Instead, it nurtures further precarious labour. Empirically, the article draws on ethnographically collected material from the media practices of digital artists and programmers who engage with two popular free software production tools, Blender and Synfig.", "This paper presents an educational tool based on open source software and low cost hardware to supplement science teaching, merging concepts of remote experiment, virtual worlds and virtual learning environment.

A symbiotic software and hardware approach facilitates the animation process for novice and expert users alike. We overcome limitations inherent to all previous tangible devices by allowing users to directly control complex rigs using only a small set (5-10) of physical controls. This avoids oversimplification of the pose space and excessively bulky device configurations. Our algorithm derives a small device configuration from complex character rigs, often containing hundreds of degrees of freedom, and a set of sparse sample poses. Importantly, only the most influential degrees of freedom are controlled directly, yet detailed motion is preserved based on a pose interpolation technique. We designed a modular collection of joints and splitters, which can be assembled to represent a wide variety of skeletons. Each joint piece combines a universal joint and two twisting elements, allowing to accurately sense its configuration. The mechanical design provides a smooth inverse kinematics-like user experience and is not prone to gimbal locking.

This paper describes the development of new models for underwater haptic actuation and the ongoing prototype development process necessary for creating this tool. Our objective is to create a system that detects underwater topographies to assist the location of sunken objects in flooded areas by sending haptic signals to wearer's fingertips produced by micro-pumps that propel water of varying pressures. This feedback system extends current haptic technologies by providing hybrid actuation including pressure and vibration underwater, while preserving the wearer's natural ability to grasp objects. This technology has many potential applications beyond underwater echo-haptic location, such as new interfaces for virtual reality object simulation in aqueous environments.", "This paper presents the GOOSE GNSS open receiver platform. The platform is based on a multi-frequency multi-constellation GNSS receiver which can be deployed either as a fixed PC receiver or as an embedded portable one. The main feature of this platform is to provide to GNSS software developers the possibility to have a deeper control on receiver hardware and to replace all the provided software functionality with their own software modules. This is possible with the open interface protocol called Open GNSS Receiver Protocol (OGRP), which has been developed by Fraunhofer in the same project. The results show how the receiver hardware performs in the different scenarios.", "Accurate indoor localization requires non line-of sight ranging error identification and mitigation. Current research has focused on methods that improve accuracy but are too complex to be executed in resource-constrained hardware in real-time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a non line-of-sight mitigation technique using impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) experimental ranging data. We show that using this technique, ranging non-line-of-sight (NLOS) errors can he significantly reduced in the location estimate. The method is less complex than other methods used in related work and can potentially be implemented on microcontrollers.", "This paper presents a system that is ideal for water monitoring over stretched distances. The system is composed of a computer-based control monitoring unit (CMU) and several remote process transceivers (RPTs). The CMU contains a software program and a transceiver. It issues commands to and receives sensor data from the RPTs. It also saves previous data and displays the current sensor data from each RPT through a graphical user interface. The RPTs are stationed along the length of water systems like rivers where water data are sampled and sent to the CMU. Sensor data include the temperature, level, and turbidity of the water at the location of a particular RPT. The scalability feature allows the system to cover a much extended distance along the length of a river. It is achieved through the ability of the RPTs to relay the command from the CMU to other RPTs and the data from other RPTs to the CMU using user-defined protocols. Test results show that an effective distance of 1300 m is achieved between the CMU and the nearest RPT and between RPTs. Further, there are no significant differences between the actual sensor data and the values received at the CMU.", "The aim of this article is the design and implementation of intelligent irrigation devices using the Arduino microcontroller. The control interface of the irrigation system was created as a mobile application. The currently existing various similar solutions are all from the perspective of money unprofitable. The present solution is very cheap and effective especially for home usage. Following the extension it can also be applied on a larger scale e.g. for buildings greenhouse, intelligent garden and others. We used these hardware components for realization: the microcontroller Arduino Yun, real-time clock DS1302, two humidity sensors, relays and solenoid valves. The application for controlling irrigation device using mobile technology was created in the programming language Java. This easy smart irrigation system can be controlled by smart-phone or tablet with operating systems Android 4 and above. Reactions and all functions of proposed intelligent system were verified with statistical surveyes. The results were evaluated by using technics of explorating analysis and non parametric Levene's test. By analysis we can determine the reliability of the irrigation equipment and so clarify the behavior of the system for the existence of systematic and random errors.", null, "Monitoring the crop water status of high-value crops such as fruit trees is generally performed through periodic measurements of physiological indicators on leaves or fruits using sophisticated instruments and complex procedures. These measurements are very often difficult to translate into irrigation advice. Soil water potential (SWP), however, is a basic soil water status variable that is correlated with plant water uptake, and it can easily be measured using sensors. Soil water potential can provide useful support for irrigation scheduling at the field scale, thus enhancing water savings in agricultural areas. In this work, we present the results of an experimental study conducted in the 2014 agricultural season on a peach orchard located in Lodi (Northern Italy). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an irrigation scheduling based on continuous SWP measurements collected at two soil depths (-15 and -35 cm) on the crop water status and the peach production relative to the farmer's commonly adopted irrigation practice. To answer the question in the title, periodic measurements of physiological parameters such as leaf water potential, stomatal resistance (r(s)), transpiration (E), and crop water stress index were performed, along with monitoring of fruit size evolution and fruit sugar content at harvest. All of these variables were measured to assess the crop physiological state of the trees subjected to the two different irrigation treatments, with the final objective of determining whether the irrigation scheduling based on SWP measurements compromised the quality and quantity of produced peaches. Although obtained for only one agricultural season, the results showed that no considerably crop water stress occurred, even for the irrigation treatment based on SWP measurements. In particular, the most extreme values of leaf water potential, r(s), E, and crop water stress index measured at midday were -2 MPa, 45 s m(-1), 1.4 mm h(-1) and 0.5, respectively, which are in good agreement with those observed in many studies for well-watered orchards in Mediterranean areas. In conclusion, we can stress that SWP monitoring can be considered to be a reliable alternative to the more costly and time-consuming physiological measurements for the irrigation scheduling of fruit crops such as peach orchards. This approach provides continuous information about the soil water status, thereby preventing plant water stress and reducing irrigation water consumption at the farm scale.", ["This paper will describe how with the setup of an Agricultural Remote Sensing Lab at The University of Queensland's Gatton Campus (UQGatton) in late 2014, driven by new undergraduate course developments in Precision Agriculture -plus the role of in-house specifically designed drones with miniature sensors capable of recording agriculturally useful remotely sensed data, has proved successful in stimulating interest and engagement in both traditional agriculture / agribusiness students as well as non-traditional (Engineering and Science) students, to engage with these technologies and techniques.", "Four 'Design & Build' projects will be described in the paper and the role they have played both for the industry partners and the students involved.

The A2720 System can host one to four independent current-controlled bipolar DC-DC modules, each capable of delivering up to +/- 20 A and +/- 50 V in DC-operation, in a single 19-inch, 3U standard crate. Each module implements a fully digital control loop (PID regulation) with high-resolution PWM pattern generation that makes the system versatile and easy to \"tune\" to any load condition. The A2720 System is composed by the crate of the power supplies and up to 4 AC/ DC \"bulk\" power supplies, connected electrically by a proprietary backplane. Remote communication is guaranteed by means of a 10/100 Mbps Ethernet autosensing socket present on each A2720 module front panel.", null, "Communication networks these days face a relentless increase in traffic load. Multi-gigabit-per-second links are becoming widespread, and network devices are under continuous stress, so testing whether they guarantee the specified throughput or delay is a must. Software-based solutions, such as packet-train traffic injection, were adequate for lower speeds, but they have become inaccurate in the current scenario. Hardware-based solutions have proved to be very accurate, but usually at the expense of much higher development and acquisition costs. Fortunately, new affordable FPGA SoC devices, as well as high-level synthesis tools, can very efficiently reduce these costs. In this article we show the advantages of hardware-based solutions in terms of accuracy, comparing the results obtained in an FPGA SoC development platform and in NetFPGA-10G to those of software. Results show that a hardware-based solution is significantly better, especially at 10 Gb/s. By leveraging high-level synthesis and open source platforms, prototypes were quickly developed. Noticeable advantages of our proposal are high accuracy, competitive cost with respect to the software counterpart, which runs in high-end off-the-shelf workstations, and the capability to easily evolve to upcoming 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s networks.", "The Internet of Things (IoT), often referred as the future Internet; is a collection of interconnected devices integrated into the world-wide network that covers almost everything and could be available anywhere. IoT is an emerging technology and aims to play an important role in saving money, conserving energy, eliminating gap and better monitoring for intensive management on a routine basis. On the other hand, it is also facing certain design constraints such as technical challenges, social challenges, compromising privacy and performance tradeoffs. This paper surveys major technical limitations that are hindering the successful deployment of the IoT such as standardization, interoperability, networking issues, addressing and sensing issues, power and storage restrictions, privacy and security, etc. This paper categorizes the existing research on the technical constraints that have been published in the recent years.

The concept of a systematic jamming attack is considered, where the interference signal is intentionally synchronized with the GNSS signals, with the intention of causing maximum disruption with the minimum power expenditure. Various attack methodologies are examined for the case of a civilian L1 receiver. It is shown that, depending on the attack strategy, the target signal and the target receiver, data-recovery, navigation and timing can be denied to a user with some tens of decibels less average power than a traditional jamming attack. It is further shown that some attacks may be capable to effectively deny some receiver functionality in a subtle manner such that presence of the malicious interference goes undetected. Key signal and receiver features that expose a vulnerability are identified and some means of improving receiver robustness are provided.", "The complexity of a particle accelerator implies the remote control of very large numbers of devices, with many different typologies, either distributed along the accelerator or concentrated in locations, often far away from each other. Local and global control systems handle the devices through dedicated communication channels and interfaces. Each controlled device is practically a \"smart node\" performing a specific task. In addition, very often, those tasks are managed in real-time mode. The performances required to the control interface has an influence on the cost of the distributed nodes as well as on their hardware and software implementation. In large facilities (e.g. CERN) the \"smart nodes\" derive from specific in-house developments. Alternatively, it is possible to find on the market commercial devices, whose performances (and prices) are spread over a broad range, and spanning from proprietary design (customizable to the user's needs) to open source/design. In this paper, we will describe some applications of smart nodes in the particle accelerators field, with special focus on the power supplies for magnets. In modern accelerators, in fact, magnets and their associated power supplies constitute systems distributed along the accelerator itself, and strongly interfaced with the remote control system as well as with more specific (and often more demanding) orbit/trajectory feedback systems. We will give examples of actual systems, installed and operational on two light sources, Elettra and FERMI, located in the Elettra Research Center in Trieste, Italy.", "Industrial control systems have traditionally been built around dedicated wired solutions.

These systems consist of a variety of different components/sensors and many processes like clustering, routing, security, and self-organization. Routing is necessary for medical-based WSNs because it allows remote data delivery and it facilitates network scalability in large hospitals. However, routing entails several problems, mainly due to the open nature of wireless networks, and these need to be addressed. This paper looks at two of the problems that arise due to wireless routing between the nodes and access points of a medical WSN (for IoT use): black hole and selective forwarding (SF) attacks. A solution to the former can readily be provided through the use of cryptographic hashes, while the latter makes use of a neighbourhood watch and threshold-based analysis to detect and correct SF attacks. The scheme proposed here is capable of detecting a selective forwarding attack with over 96% accuracy and successfully identifying the malicious node with 83% accuracy.", "The increasing civilian demand for autonomous aerial vehicle in the professional markets led to an abundance of inexpensive navigational hardware platforms and vehicle prototypes.

For five days (28-29 August 2014 and 1-3 September 2014), the sensor platform was installed inside the SmartBus and measured air quality gas compounds (nitrogen dioxide, carbon oxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) during the service. Data were collected and analyzed on the bases of an air quality index, which provided qualitative insights on the air status potentially experienced by the users. The results obtained are in agreement with the synoptic meteorological conditions, the urban background air quality reference measurements and the potential traffic flow variations. Furthermore, they indicated that the air quality status was influenced by the gas component NO and CO.

STRZSM trails can be captured using remote sensing, in-situ or ground based measurements or through land surface models. Apart from this, new generation of low-cost soil moisture sensors present cost effective way of in-situ measurement of soil moisture, but suffer from inherent heterogeneity between sensing techniques, protocol variations and non-standard calibration methods. Thus, long term monitoring of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture trails requires interoperability between sensing platforms, process-based and statistical modeling and inclusion of remote sensing techniques. In this study, an attempt has been made to design and deploy an interoperable sensing platform that complies with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework. Proposed system uses sensors to estimate point-based soil moisture and temperature observation at different depths of 15, 30, 45 and 60cm each. Pilot feasibility study was carried out for the duration of three months from Jan-Mar 2016 in the study area.

Using a systematisation that considers environmental effects of information and communication technologies as direct, indirect and structural, this article discerns the future socio-environmental scenarios indicative of each value model. We argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. Likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the NFCC is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the HMPP is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons. Hence, the latter is considered as the socio-environmentally auspicious choice, but comes not without transitional challenges of its own. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Designing kinesthetic haptic devices for educational applications is challenging because of the competing objectives of using low-cost components, making the device robust enough to be handled by students, and the desire to render high fidelity haptic virtual environments. In this paper, we present the evolution of a device called \" Hapkit\": a low cost, one-degree-of-freedom haptic kit that can be assembled by students. From 2013-2015, different versions of Hapkit were used in courses as a tool to teach haptics, physics, and control.

For these reasons, the adoption of wireless sensor networks able to manage several accelerometers nodes is desirable. Wireless sensor networks have several critical aspects to solve: most important are the synchronism and the high determinism in data sampling required in this kind of applications, and the possible loss of data during the wireless transmission.

The application of these parameter sets provides users of the open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as heat exchangers.", "Building robust manufacturing processes from biological components is a task that is highly complex and requires sophisticated tools to describe processes, inputs, and measurements and administrate management of knowledge, data, and materials. We argue that for bioengineering to fully access biological potential, it will require application of statistically designed experiments to derive detailed empirical models of underlying systems. This requires execution of large-scale structured experimentation for which laboratory automation is necessary. This requires development of expressive, high-level languages that allow reusability of protocols, characterization of their reliability, and a change in focus from implementation details to functional properties. We review recent developments in these areas and identify what we believe is an exciting trend that promises to revolutionize biotechnology.", "A Maker is a modern-day tinkerer and hands-on builder of DIY artifacts. Makers create their inventions wholly out of their imaginations, with the support of a rich collaborative online and in-person community. This paper describes the results from a qualitative study of adult Makers and their characteristics of collaboration in the Maker community. Results indicate that Makers exhibit a mindset of Additive Innovation. This describes the open community of sharing and learning that is the Maker community. Connections between engineering and Making are also discussed.", "In this paper, we describe the design considerations and implementation of a smart toy system, a technology for supporting the automatic recording and analysis for detecting developmental delays recognition when children play using the smart toy. To achieve this goal, we take advantage of the current commercial sensor features (reliability, low consumption, easy integration, etc.) to develop a series of sensor-based low-cost devices. Specifically, our prototype system consists of a tower of cubes augmented with wireless sensing capabilities and a mobile computing platform that collect the information sent from the cubes allowing the later analysis by childhood development professionals in order to verify a normal behaviour or to detect a potential disorder. This paper presents the requirements of the toy and discusses our choices in toy design, technology used, selected sensors, process to gather data from the sensors and generate information that will help in the decision-making and communication of the information to the collector system. In addition, we also describe the play activities the system supports.", "Robotics technology and the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence are breakthrough innovations with significant growth prospects. They have the potential to disrupt existing socio-economic facets of everyday life. Yet few studies have analysed the development of robotics innovation. This paper closes this gap by analysing current developments in innovation in robotics; how it is diffused, and what role is played by intellectual property (IP). The paper argues that robotics clusters are mainly located in the US and Europe, despite a growing presence in South Korea and China. The robotics innovation ecosystem builds on cooperative networks of actors, including individuals, research institutions, and firms. Governments play a significant role in supporting robotics innovation through funding, military demand, and national robotics strategies. Robotics competitions and prizes provide an important incentive for innovation. Patents are used to exclude third parties to secure freedom of operation, license technologies, and avoid litigation. The countries with the highest number of patent claims arc Japan, China, South Korea, and the US. The growing stock of patents owned by universities and PROs, particularly in China, is noteworthy too. Automotive and electronics companies are still the largest patent filers, but medical technologies and the Internet are emerging as new actors in the field. Secrecy is often used as a tool to appropriate innovation. Copyright protection is relevant to robotics also, mainly for its role in protecting software. Finally, open-source robotics platforms are increasingly used in the early stages of the innovation process as they allow new actors in the robotics field to optimize their initial spending on innovation.", "Typical Lab-on-a-Disc (LoaD) platforms cannot make a continuous measurement while the disc is spinning; this drawback means that the disc usually must be stopped and aligned with a sensor. This can result in measurement errors in time-dependent assays along with inaccuracies due to liquid displacement and bubble formation in the absence of a stabilising centrifugal field. This paper presents a novel concept for a wirelessly electrified-Lab-on-a-Disc (eLoaD) platform that allows continuous measurement of experimental parameters while the disc is spinning. This platform incorporates all the components needed for measurement within the rotating frame of reference, and bidirectional transmission of data outside this reference frame, thus allowing for online measurement independent of the rotation of the disc. The eLoaD platform is conceived in a modular manner whereby an interchangeable and non-disposable 'Application Disc' can be fitted to the eLoaD platform and so the system can be adapted for a range of optical, electrochemical and other measurement types. As an application example, optical readout, using the Application Disc fitted with a silicon photomultiplier, is demonstrated using a tagged chemiluminescent antibody, which is commonly used, for instance, in ELISA assays. The precision of the eLoaD platform is >94%, while its accuracy, when compared to a commercial benchtop luminometer, is higher than 96%. The modular design of this platform will permit extension of this technology to many other LoaD applications.", "This paper describes the structure of a mobile robot suitable for laboratory experiments. The robot is developed with the ideas of minimizing the production costs and of executing motion commands received from an external computer that runs the (possible computational intensive) planning algorithms. The proposed system is a differential wheeled robot built based on an Arduino platform, it has a small physical size and it is capable of wireless communication. These characteristics make it useful for validating planning algorithms for mobile robots in computer-guided laboratory experiments, while lowering the expenses required by such a setup. Moreover, in order to compensate the communication delay between the central computer and the robot, an estimation algorithm is implemented on the robot for obtaining a smoother motion.", "The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the experiential learning of electronics subject matter is effective in the middle school open learning of robotics. Electronics is often ignored in robotics courses. Since robotics courses are typically comprised of computer-related subjects, and mechanical and electrical engineering, these three areas should be emphasized equally. Many studies reveal impressive learning of computer science and mechanical engineering, but clear evidence of the effectiveness of electronics learning in the higher order thinking skills of middle school students is still lacking. We designed three different robotics courses with electronics subject matter introduced through experiential learning. A parallel group design was used, where three different open learning courses were implemented for middle school students. Based on results of the first and second implementations, we improved students' learning of relevant content for each successive step of the experiment. In total, 381 middle school students participated in all experiments and were surveyed using pre- and post-tests. The collected data were analyzed using a quantitative research methodology. The findings revealed that the teaching approach was effective. During the learning process, student interest in robotics increased, and overall achievement improved with a medium effect size (eta(2) = 0.13). The best results for the learning of electronics subject matter were found in the learning process (eta(2) = 0.44), where experimental sharing of electronics parts was the most evident approach used by the students. Examination of learning material structure in light of the shared electronics subject matter is analyzed and discussed and possible directions for future research are presented.", "An emerging topic in the development field is how information and communication technology (ICT) can be used for economic and social development. The general approach relies on technological determinism, whereby the discussion revolves around how and to what extent will ICT support development. It assumes the benefits of ICT as inherent. This approach ignores that ICT is created and experienced within a socially divisive and complex space. A more critical and sociological analysis is needed for development studies to better understand the implications of ICT initiatives. In this article, I argue that Saskia Sassen's analytical framework of technology and society as embedded avoids this technological determinism and allows social theorists to account for social and material aspects of ICT. To support this alternative framework, I present a case study of a rural ICT initiative in Gujarat, India, and discuss how this re-conceptualization reveals more nuanced understanding of ICT and society. Based on interviews and field research, I find that technology creates new social understandings for the rural ICT users, but also that society shapes the technology to make it inaccessible for them.", "This paper presents a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system consisting of a robust visual odometry and an efficient back-end with loop-closure detection and pose-graph optimization (PGO). Robustness of the visual odometry is achieved by utilizing dual cameras pointing different directions with no overlap in their respective fields of view mounted on an micro aerial vehicle (MAV). The theory behind this dual-camera visual odometry can be easily extended to applications with multiple cameras. The back-end of the SLAM system maintains a keyframe-based global map, which is used for loop-closure detection. An adaptivewindow PGO method is proposed to refine keyframe poses of the global map and thus correct pose drift that is inherent in the visual odometry. The position of each map point is then refined implicitly due to its relative representation to its source keyframe. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed visual SLAM algorithm for applications onboard MAVs in experiments with both autonomous and manual flights. The pose tracking results are compared with the ground truth data provided by an external tracking system.", "The objective of this work is to develop a framework that can deploy and provide coordination between multiple heterogeneous agents when a swarm robotic system adopts a decentralized approach; each robot evaluates its relative rank among the other robots in terms of travel distance and cost to the goal. Accordingly, robots are allocated to the sub-tasks for which they have the highest rank (utility). This paper provides an analysis of existing swarm control environments and proposes a software environment that facilitates a rapid deployment of multiple robotic agents. The framework (UBSwarm) exploits our utility-based task allocation algorithm. UBSwarm configures these robots and assigns the group of robots a particular task from a set of available tasks. Two major tasks have been introduced that show the performance of a robotic group. This robotic group is composed of heterogeneous agents. In the results, a premature example that has prior knowledge about the experiment shows whether or not the robots are able to accomplish the task.", "Developing self-organised swarm systems capable of adapting to environmental changes as well as to dynamic situations is a complex challenge. An efficient labour division model, with the ability to regulate the distribution of work among swarm robots, is an important element of this kind of system. This paper extends the popular response threshold model and proposes a new adaptive response threshold model (ARTM). Experiments were carried out in simulation and in real-robot scenarios with the aim of studying the performance of this new adaptive model. Results presented in this paper verify that the extended approach improves on the adaptability of previous systems. For example, by reducing collision duration among robots in foraging missions, our approach helps small swarms of robots to adapt more efficiently to changing environments, thus increasing their self-sustainability (survival rate). Finally, we propose a minimal version of ARTM, which is derived from the conclusions drawn through real-robot and simulation results.", "Energy consumption in battery operated mobile devices is a critical issue. Autonomy periods are increasingly compromised as the complexity of tasks, such as the widespread video decoding ones, is also increased. While new higher-capacity batteries are being developed, techniques to control, i.e. save, the energy consumption can provide a significant benefit. This paper presents the proposal, implementation and test of a real-time closed-loop control system applicable to the power-consumption regulation of multimedia mobile devices. The novel closed loop does not need any specific power sensor but only standard performance monitoring counters (PMCs) available in common mobile processors. From them, the power consumption is estimated with an algorithm to be included into the operating system, along with the control system itself. A theoretical system model has been first developed to (1) enable the design of some controllers and (2) validate the actual results obtained from the control system prototype into a given low-cost development board. These results prove the control-system stability and the comparative suitability of classic controllers to keep the multimedia-system consumption close to the desired value in steady state with settling times as short as a single sample interval(1).", "Current progress in wearable and implanted health monitoring technologies has strong potential to alter the future of healthcare services by enabling ubiquitous monitoring of patients. A typical health monitoring system consists of a network of wearable or implanted sensors that constantly monitor physiological parameters. Collected data are relayed using existing wireless communication protocols to a base station for additional processing. This article provides researchers with information to compare the existing low-power communication technologies that can potentially support the rapid development and deployment of WBAN systems, and mainly focuses on remote monitoring of elderly or chronically ill patients in residential environments.", "Generation of accurate IP power models requires determination of correct simulation conditions for the different input pins of the IP. Determining such a set of inputs for individual IP blocks in a design is expensive in cost and time, and is also highly error prone. Additionally, it is desirable to identify IP instances in a design, where these simulation conditions are not met. These are relevant problems in the context of modern day microprocessor designs, which are designed using a very large number of IPs, either developed in-house or sourced from external vendors. In this paper, we examine these problems in an industrial context and introduce FVCAG, a framework for enabling efficient and accurate power modelling. FVCAG enables a more thorough IP power modelling than that can be accomplished using current state of the art techniques. Experimental evaluation of the proposed framework on the standard cell library and macros used in the design of an industry class high performance microprocessor design demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of proposed framework.", "This article develops the concept of \"smart velomobility\" that is concerned with networked practices, systems and technologies of cycling. The concept draws on velomobility, Smart Mobility/Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Smart Cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). The article presents results from an empirical study, where 80 riders of a networked fleet of e-bikes discuss their experience of smart velomobility. The results show how digital and physical mobilities merge, the way riders of the networked fleet interact with the data, how they share the data and how they feel tracked (privacy). The conclusion sketches out future research of \"smart velomobilities\" and also points out the policy and innovation potential of cycling as active, sustainable and networked mode of transport in the context of Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.

The increased set of features available at the user terminal also leads to the maximization of the security risks in 4G network. Hence, to overcome the security problems in the 4G network, in this paper we propose to develop distributed security architecture for authentication. In this proposed architecture, the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol is used for authenticating the mobile nodes within the network through hop by hop authentication and neighbor authentication.", "This paper applies the theoretical lens of infrastructure to study hacking practices that take issue with large-scale communication networks. The paper analyzes a series of hacks targeting the Global System for Mobile Communications (i.e., networks for mobile telephony) carried out by a cluster of people affiliated or sympathetic to the German Chaos Computer Club between 2001 and 2014. These hacks aim at acquiring proprietary knowledge and facilitating the autonomous operation of local mobile phone networks for communities, independent of corporate network providers. The contribution of this paper is to show how hacking of this kind can be understood as transgressive infrastructuring, a way of engaging critically with infrastructure that, in the case of GSM hacking, relied on three strategies-reverse engineering, re-implementation, and parallel operation, all of which aim at appropriating the targeted network intellectually, legally, functionally, and/or operationally.", "Many today believe that the mobile Internet was invented by Apple in the USA with their iPhone, enabling a data-driven Internet ecosystem to disrupt the staid voice and SMS business models of the telecom carriers. History, however, shows that the mobile Internet was first successfully commercialised in Japan, in 1999. Some authors such as Richard Feasey in Telecommunications Policy (Issue 6, 2015) argue that operators had been confused and unprepared when the Internet emerged and introduced \"walled gardens\", without Internet access. This comment article reviews in detail how the operators reacted when the fixed, and later the mobile Internet spread: some introduced walled gardens, some opened it for the \"unofficial\" content on the Internet. The article concludes that most large European telecom and information technology companies and their investors have a tradition of risk avoidance and pursued high-price strategies that led them to regularly fail against better and cheaper foreign products and services, not only when the wireless Internet was introduced, but also when PCs and the fixed Internet were introduced. Consequences, such as the need to enable future disruptions and boost the skills needed to master them, are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Position and Orientation System (POS), which is conventionally employed for locating and orienting MMS, allows direct georeferencing of spatial data in real-time. Since the performance of a POS depends on both the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), poor GNSS conditions, such as in long tunnels and underground, introduce the necessity for post-processing. In above-ground railways, mobile mapping technology is employed with high performance sensors for finite usage, which has considerable potential for enhancing railway safety and management in real-time. In contrast, underground railways present a challenge for a conventional POS thus alternative configurations are necessary to maintain data accuracy and alleviate the need for post-processing. This paper introduces a method of rail-bound navigation to replace the role of GNSS for railway applications. The proposed method integrates INS and track alignment data for environment-independent navigation and reduces the demand of post-processing. The principle of rail-bound navigation is presented and its performance is verified by an experiment using a consumer-grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a small-scale railway model. The method produced a substantial improvement in position and orientation for a poorly initialised system in centimetre positional accuracy. The potential improvements indicated by, and limitations of rail-bound navigation are also considered for further development in existing railway systems.", "An air quality monitoring system (AQMS) based on the IEEE/ISO/IEC 21451 standards is presented. In the development of an AQMS, we have used the GSM wireless communication module. The developed system is capable of the real-time measurement of air polluted gases, such as CO2, CO, NO2, and SO2. The machine-to-machine communication of the air quality monitoring station and PC with the sink node was successfully implemented. Various gas sensor technologies were evaluated for the system and ultimately electrochemical and infrared sensors were used. Hardware and software for an AQMS was designed and implemented. The AQMS uses an array of sensors to take the measurements of the ambient air surrounding it and wirelessly transmits the data to the base station. A graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy for end user(s) to interact with the system, was developed. Gas concentration values are plotted on the GUI. The defined calibration of the instruments at time interims assures that the desired accuracy is sustained. This paper offers further elucidations to design disputes raised in earlier studies.", "Software packages for 3D design and additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, initially known as rapid prototyping (RP) have emerged during the last years, as a cutting edge solutions for custom prototyping. These new tools and technologies lower the design costs, but also allow rapid creation of fully functional components. This paper describes the FDM and 3DP rapid prototyping technologies that were used to create elements and tools in the wood industry field. Total costs of manufacturing related to the fabrication of sample elements and tools are analysed. One of the main recognised issues of wider application of rapid prototyping technologies is their still very high costs related to all production aspects, starting with a lack of available materials, material cost, up to high cost of available commercial equipment, usually focused only on specific solutions and limited range of materials. Generally, AM costs can be divided into the group of fixed costs and variable ones. This paper deals with the optimization of the production costs of fabricated elements in case of small-scale production, and optimization of variable costs (processing and post-processing, costs of enforcement, and material costs).", "Successful operation of micro aerial vehicles in partially known environments requires globally consistent plans based on incomplete environment models and quick reactions to unknown obstacles by means of real-time planning of collision-free trajectories. In this paper, we propose a complete layered mission and navigation planning system based on coarse prior knowledge and local maps from omnidirectional onboard obstacle perception. We generate trajectories in a multilayered approach: from mission planning to global and local trajectory planning to motion control.", "With the development of new technologies, which are able to connect with each other through network, the Internet of things (IoT), raised its popularity.

This project also seeks to improve home safety by the implementation of an IP camera for video surveillance and sensors, all this system will be available to the user via any android device, giving access to their smart house from any place around the world. Moreover, the development of this intelligent house assistant is made with a low budget.", "Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters provides farmers with useful information, which can improve the quality and productivity of crops grown in greenhouses. The objective of this study was to develop a greenhouse environment measurement system using a low-cost microcontroller with open-source software. Greenhouse environment parameters measured were air temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The ranges of the temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration were -40 to 120 degrees C, 0 to 100%, and 0 to 10,000 ppm, respectively. A 128 x 64 graphic LCD display was used for real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environments. An Arduino Uno R3 consisted of a USB interface for communicating with a computer, 6 analog inputs, and 14 digital input/output pins. A temperature/relative humidity sensor was connected to digital pins 2 and 3. A CO2 sensor was connected to digital pins 12 and 13. The LCD was connected to digital pin 1 (TX). The sketches were programmed with the Arduino Software (IDE). A measurement system including the Arduino board, sensors, and accessories was developed (totaling $244). Data for the environmental parameters in a venlo-type greenhouse were obtained using this system without any problems. We expect that the low-cost microcontroller using open-source software can be used for monitoring the environments of plastic greenhouses in Korea.", "Energy neutral operation of WSNs can be achieved by exploiting the idleness of the workload to bring the average power consumption of each node below the harvesting power available. This paper proposes a combination of state-of-the-art low-power design techniques to minimize the local and global impact of the two main activities of each node: sampling and communication. Dynamic power management is adopted to exploit low-power modes during idle periods, while asynchronous wake-up and prediction based data collection are used to opportunistically activate hardware components and network nodes only when they are strictly required. Furthermore, the concept of \"model-based sensing\" is introduced to push prediction-based data collection techniques as close as possible to the sensing elements. The results achieved on representative real-world WSN case studies show that the combined benefits of the design techniques adopted is more than linear, providing an overall power reduction of more than three orders of magnitude.

This shift has considerable socio-economic and cultural implications that are too often ignored by the existing economic and political economy literatures. This article surveys key patterns in the adoption of digital platforms across Europe, and finds, based on an array of quantitative metrics, apparently contradictory trends. We observe, on one hand, the rise of closed TV platforms as the paradigmatic commercial model of the new media landscape; but on the other, the cultural and material openness of the Internet, which is radically transforming the consumption of television. While hybrid arrangements abound, industry solutions are still awkwardly matched to consumer preferences. Without drawing too sharp a line between technology and culture, the article presents an overview of the many ways the changing meaning of digital platforms continues to shape the global television industry.

AtlantikSolar is a 5.6m-wingspan and 6.9kg mass low-altitude long-endurance UAV that was designed to provide perpetual endurance at a geographic latitude of 45N in a 4-month window centered around June 21st. A specific design emphasis is robust perpetual endurance with respect to local meteorological disturbances (e.g. clouds, winds, downdrafts). Providing the necessary energetic safety margins is a significant challenge on small-scale solar-powered UAVs. This paper thus describes the design optimizations undertaken on the AtlantikSolar UAV for maximum energetic safety margins. In addition, this paper presents the flight test results, analysis and performance verification of AtlantikSolar's first perpetual endurance continuous 28-hour flight. The flight results show a minimum state-of-charge of 40% or excess time of 7 hours during the night. In addition, the charge margin of 5.9 hours indicates sufficiently-fast battery charging during the day. Both margins exceed the performance of previously demonstrated solar-powered LALE UAVs. Another centerpiece of the paper is the verification of these flight results with the theoretical structural-, aerodynamics-and power-models that were developed and used to conceptually design the UAV. The solar-power income model is extended to take into account solar-panel temperature effects, the exact aircraft geometry and the current orientation and is compared against flight results. Finally, the paper provides an analysis and overview into under what conditions and with which energetic margins perpetual flight is possible with today's battery-and solar-cell technology. A perpetual endurance window of up to 6 months around June 21st is predicted at northern latitudes for the AtlantikSolar UAV configuration without payload. A final outlook into first perpetual endurance applications shows that perpetual flight with miniaturized sensing payloads (small optical and infrared cameras) is possible with a perpetual flight window of 4-5 months.", "The firmness of an apple is a commonly used indicator of quality and maturity during sorting and cold storage. Its dependence on the elastic properties means that vibration resonance tests are favored over other - often destructive - tests. We present a novel non-destructive and non-contacting method using laser-generated and laser-detected elastic waves to infer the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of an apple from the velocity of surface and body waves. In addition, we analyze the attenuation of these waves. Although the elastic and anelastic properties all decay with age, attenuation is the most sensitive to changes in ripeness of the apple.

However, as robots become better integrated in therapeutic environments, they will also influence therapists; and if robots are designed correctly, they could positively influence therapists' well-being. Understanding how robots could be used in such a way is especially important as therapists of autistic children (and therapists of mentally disabled people in general) have one of the highest risks of workplace burnout. This paper describes a series of studies conducted to understand therapists' attitudes towards robotic support and to discover what is most needed in such devices; this paper also describes an experimental study of the feasibility of robots playing one of those roles. Through observational studies and a series of ten meetings, with a group of seven therapists of autism, a list of possible roles was created. In a larger questionnaire based study, therapists gave a ranking to various robot roles and functions (a child's behaviour analyser and support in critical/dangerous situations were given the highest priority). Therapists also stated that they expect robots to help them in the workplace, help prepare documentation and make their work more systematic. In a Wizard-of-Oz type experimental study, a robot was used to play a role of \"emotional mirror\" with seven therapist-child pairs. Study participants stated that a robot was acceptable and was not disturbing, although most did not find it particularly useful. Our conclusions indicate that therapists want robots to play a larger role than just a therapeutic device, and such roles can be added to robots without disturbing sessions with clients.", "The purpose of this paper is to explore the field of open development in lower and middle income countries (LMIC) through a review of the literature. We examined 269 articles between 2010 and 2015, that were retrieved through keyword searches of the Scopus database and four ICT4D journals. This article adopts the pathway of effects model to analyze contributions according to inputs, mechanisms and outputs of open initiatives in LMICs. The review finds a fairly even spread of articles across the three stages of effects. Studies that disentangled reasons why or why not openness makes a difference provided the most insight to underlying mechanisms and impact of open initiatives. We found very little evidence that research within this area is concerned with the perspectives of poor and marginalized people - notably women. We therefore question the normative value of open development as a means to transform power relations. However, we argue that a more concentrated vision within this field is needed to exploit the full potential of digitally enabled openness for development.", "The research area of the compressed baryonic matter - CBM experiment (FAIR/GSI in Darmstadt) is sub-nuclear physics, thus hadron-baryon and quark-gluon, and the essence of phase transitions in the area of hot nuclear matter, and dense strongly interacting matter. Our interest in this paper are mainly considerations on the impact of such large infrastructural experiments and possibilities they give to local, smaller but very active, university based research groups and communities. Research and technical input from such groups is depicted on the background of the CBM detector infrastructure and electronic instrumentation just under design and test fabrication for this experiment. An essential input to this research originates from Poland via the agreed in-kind contribution. The areas of expertise of these groups are: superconductivity, structural large scale cabling, precision machined parts, RF and microwave technology, analog and advanced digital electronics, distributed measurement and control systems, etc.", "This paper presents the autonomous control of a fully customized quadrotor MAV in UPS-denied environments based on onboard visual odometry. To achieve the best integration and efficiency, key modules of the MAV hardware system have been investigated and optimized iteratively, inclusive of mechanical frame, propulsion system, flight controller and the visual sensor. An optical-flow module is developed with the low-cost and small-scaled visual sensor as well as height estimation. In order to achieve real-time and high-accuracy position feedback, vision odometry is estimated based on pixel intensity block matching with rotational motions compensated. Subsequently, autonomous path tracking is achieved from the fusion of corresponding sensing feedback with proper design of a Kalman Filter.", "Some earthquakes generate tsunamis in the ocean or coastal regions. An early alert is essential for the coastal population to prevent loss of human life. The propagation of the alert is made through a range of communication means: radio, television, sirens, landlines and cell phones, social media including Twitter, and, if electrical power and communications utilities are blacked-out, through an alternative opportunistic network. In this article, a special device, named Witness Unit (WU), designed to work with a satellite network is presented as an alternative communications means in a temporarily degraded disaster environment. A greedy heuristic algorithm for the placement and deployment of the WUs is introduced and its interaction with emergency managers and citizens is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a need to screen a given drug against a bacterial infection outside of the laboratory. To address this need, we have designed and built an inexpensive and easy-to-use 3D-printer-based system that allows easily readable quantitative tests for the performance of antibacterial drugs. The platform creates a sterile diagnostic device by using 3D printing, and the device is filled automatically with growth medium, and then antibiotics are sprayed onto the medium by ink-jet technology. The sample for testing can be introduced via a fluid port, and the printer hot bed is used to incubate the device, allowing operation in the field. Combining advantages from various established tests of antibacterial performance, this allows the comparison of a specific antibiotics and bacteria. Also, this system can create and test several antibiotic formulations for therapeutic use, and we demonstrate this potential by investigating a mixture of pathogens that are only killed by a mixture of drugs.", "In order to allow Micro Areal Vehicles (MAVs) to autonomously explore urban areas a precise knowledge of the MAV's kinematic state is essential. Thus, an integrated navigation system is presented in this paper. It provides a precise self-localization in both; indoor and outdoor areas. In order to circumvent the disadvantages of common image or laser based navigation systems, the information from both sensors are fused together on an early stage. That means, laser rangefinder's distance measurements are referred to image pixels. This results in 2.5-D images. But in order to do so, the pose between both sensors has to be known. Therefore a process that allows a calibration of the sensors' extrinsic parameters is presented in this paper. Our navigation filter bases on a reduced SLAM approach combined with relative motion measurements. Both elements benefit from the 2.5-D images. The scale factor of the relative translational motion can be simply measured, while the landmarks can be initialized instantaneously with precisely known depth. This results in a navigation system that provides precise and long-term stable navigation solutions, independently from structure and condition of the environment.", "Audition is a rich source of spatial, identity, linguistic and paralinguistic information. Processing all this information requires acquisition, processing and interpretation of sound sources, which are instantaneous, invisible and noisy signals. This can lead to different responses by the system in relation to the information perceived. This paper presents our first implementation of an integration framework for speech processing. Acquisition includes sound capture, sound source localization, tracking, separation and enhancement, and voice activity detection. Processing involves speech and emotion recognition. Interpretation consists of translating speech utterances into commands that can influence interaction through dialogue management and speech synthesis. The paper also describes two visualization interfaces, inspired by comic strips, to represent live vocal interactions in real life environments. These interfaces are used to demonstrate how the framework performs in live interactions and its use in a usability study.", "An approach for long term localization, stabilization, and navigation of micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environment is presented in this paper. The proposed method relies strictly on onboard sensors of employed MAVs and does not require any external positioning system. The core of the method consists in extraction of information from pictures consequently captured using a camera carried by the particular MAV. Visual features are obtained from images of the surface under the MAV, and stored into a map that is represented by these features. The position of the MAV is then obtained through matching with previously stored features. An important part of the proposed system is a novel approach for exploration and mapping of the workspace of robots. This method enables efficient exploring of the unknown environment, while keeping the iteratively built map of features consistent. The proposed algorithm is suitable for mapping of surfaces, both outdoor and indoor, with various density of the image features. The sufficient precision and long term persistence of the method allows its utilization for stabilization of large MAV groups that work in formations with small relative distances between particular vehicles. Numerous experiments with quadrotor helicopters and various numerical simulations have been realized for verification of the entire system and its components.", "The bandwidth and latency requirements of next-generation datacenter networks stress the limits of CMOS manufacturing. A key trend in their design will be a move from single-channel links and switches to multi-channel links and switches. Today's network topologies erase this distinction, providing the illusion of a unified network fabric. In this work we propose P-FatTree, which is a FatTree topology designed specifically for the future multi-channel reality. P-FatTree requires fewer switch chips and as a result has lower cost, power consumption, and latency than existing approaches. Furthermore, by embracing the parallel nature of the network itself, it enables compelling new ways to better manage and deliver application traffic.", "A soft condensed matter sensor (SCMS) designed to measure strains on the human body is presented. The hybrid material based on carbon black (CB) and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was bonded to a textile elastic band and used as a sensor on the human wrist to measure hand motion by detecting the movement of tendons in the wrist. Additionally it was able to track the blood pulse wave of a person, allowing for the determination of pulse wave peaks corresponding to the systole and diastole blood pressures in order to calculate the heart rate. Sensor characterization was done using mechanical cycle testing, and the band sensor achieved a gauge factor of 4-6.3 while displaying low signal relaxation when held at a strain levels. Near-linear signal performance was displayed when loading to successively higher strain levels up to 50% strain.", "The present work studies the effect of three insect-proof screens with different geometrical and aerodynamic characteristics on the air velocity and temperature inside a Mediterranean multi-span greenhouse with three roof vents and without crops, divided into two independent sectors. First, the insect-proof screens were characterised geometrically by analysing digital images and testing in a low velocity wind tunnel. The wind tunnel tests gave screen discharge coefficient values of C-d,C-phi of 0.207 for screen 1 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 35.0%), 0.151 for screen 2 (13 x 30 threads.cm(-2); phi = 26.3%) and 0.325 for screen 3 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 36.0%), at an air velocity of 0.25 m.s(-1). Secondly, when screens were installed in the greenhouse, we observed a statistical proportionality between the discharge coefficient at the openings and the air velocity u(i) measured in the centre of the greenhouse, u(i) = 0.856 C-d + 0.062 (R-2 = 0.68 and p-value = 0.012). The inside-outside temperature difference Delta T-io diminishes when the inside velocity increases following the statistically significant relationship Delta T-io = (-135.85 + 57.88/u(i))(0.5) (R-2 = 0.85 and p-value = 0.0011). Different thread diameters and tension affects the screen thickness, and means that similar porosities may well be associated with very different aerodynamic characteristics. Screens must be characterised by a theoretical function C-d,C-phi = [(2e mu/K-p rho).(1/u(s)) + (2eY/K(p)0.5)](-0.5) that relates the discharge coefficient of the screen C-d,C-phi with the air velocity us. This relationship depends on the three parameters that define the aerodynamic behaviour of porous medium: permeability K-p, inertial factor Y and screen thickness e (and on air temperature that determine its density rho and viscosity mu). However, for a determined temperature of air, the pressure drop-velocity relationship can be characterised only with two parameters: Delta P = au(s)(2) + bu(s).", "The growing demand for low cost and easy to use analytical devices requires the development of reliable and rapid deposition strategies suitable for changing easily planned designs and applicable to a wide range of materials for assembling conductive tracks and sensitive elements. Further important challenges to be pursued are the possibility of using readily available instrumentation and reducing power consumption and hazardous chemical waste. This review provides an overview of the use of portable day-to-day writing tools, such as pencils and pens, for the rapid and on-demand deposition of conductive patterns on different substrates, with particular emphasis on the assembly of \"Do It Yourself\" sensors. Moreover, layer-by-layer deposition of simple or even complex three dimensional (3D) circuits, resorting to pressure driven extrusion of conductive filaments is considered. Future perspectives and potentiality of these emerging technologies for assembling sensors are also explored.", null, "The Internet of Things paradigm originates from the proliferation of intelligent devices that can sense, compute and communicate data streams in a ubiquitous information and communication network. The great amounts of data coming from these devices introduce some challenges related to the storage and processing capabilities of the information. This strengthens the novel paradigm known as Big Data. In such a complex scenario, the Cloud computing is an efficient solution for the managing of sensor data. This paper presents Polluino, a system for monitoring the air pollution via Arduino. Moreover, a Cloud-based platform that manages data coming from air quality sensors is developed.", "The holy grail of smart cities is an integrated, sustainable approach to improve the efficiency of the city's operations and the quality of life of citizens. At the heart of this vision is the citizen, who is the primary beneficiary of smart city initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six citizen-related challenges: the engagement of citizens, the improvement of citizens' data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services, and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a way of transferring insights and solutions from GIScience to smart cities.", "Remote monitoring and intelligent intervention of machines are essentials in a smart industrial environment. However, the heterogeneity of machines makes it difficult to construct solutions for this purpose. This work aims to describe how to provide smart industrial environments using Smart Gateways, RESTful Web Services, and Cloud Computing. In the proposed solution, a Smart Gateway is responsible for representing a given machines' resources as RESTful Web Services for clients and Web applications, sending monitored data to a persistence service in a Cloud, while also allowing for the remote control of these machines. As a proof of concept, a smart industrial environment was developed from the considerations of a real case study at an apparel factory. Functional testing and performance evaluation confirmed the feasibility of the solution in this case study.", "We present a high content multiwell plate cell-based assay approach to quantify protein interactions directly in cells using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) read out by automated fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Automated FLIM is implemented using wide-field time-gated detection, typically requiring only 10 s per field of view (FOV). Averaging over biological, thermal and shot noise with 100's to 1000's of FOV enables unbiased quantitative analysis with high statistical power. Plotting average donor lifetime vs. acceptor/donor intensity ratio clearly identifies protein interactions and fitting to double exponential donor decay models provides estimates of interacting population fractions that, with calibrated donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities, can yield dissociation constants. We demonstrate the application to identify binding partners of MST1 kinase and estimate interaction strength among the members of the RASSF protein family, which have important roles in apoptosis via the Hippo signalling pathway. K-D values broadly agree with published biochemical measurements.", "Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major threat to human health, but broad-spectrum antibiotics are losing efficacy. There is a need to screen a given drug against a bacterial infection outside of the laboratory. To address this need, we have designed and built an inexpensive and easy-to-use 3D-printer-based system that allows easily readable quantitative tests for the performance of antibacterial drugs. The platform creates a sterile diagnostic device by using 3D printing, and the device is filled automatically with growth medium, and then antibiotics are sprayed onto the medium by ink-jet technology. The sample for testing can be introduced via a fluid port, and the printer hot bed is used to incubate the device, allowing operation in the field. Combining advantages from various established tests of antibacterial performance, this allows the comparison of a specific antibiotics and bacteria. Also, this system can create and test several antibiotic formulations for therapeutic use, and we demonstrate this potential by investigating a mixture of pathogens that are only killed by a mixture of drugs.", "Optical approaches for hydrophone calibrations offer significant advantages over existing methods based on reciprocity. In particular, heterodyne and homodyne interferometry can accurately measure particle velocity and displacements at a specific point in space thus enabling the acoustical pressure to be measured in an absolute, direct, assumption-free manner, with traceability through the SI definition of the metre. The calibration of a hydrophone can then be performed by placing the active element of the sensor at the point where the acoustic pressure field was measured and monitoring its electrical output. However, it is crucial to validate the performance and accuracy of such optical methods by direct comparison rather than through device calibration. Here we report on the direct comparison of two such optical interferometers used in underwater acoustics and ultrasonics in terms of acoustic pressure estimation and their associated uncertainties in the frequency range 200 kHz-3.5 MHz, with results showing agreement better than 1% in terms of pressure and typical expanded uncertainties better than 3% for both reported methods.", "In this paper, the uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based position controllers are developed to achieve the robust position control of a quadrotor using only onboard sensing. Firstly, in order to accurately estimate the positions of the quadrotor in GPS-denied environments, an open source high speed optical flow sensor PX4FLOW is adopted. Secondly, the UDE-based controllers are developed to handle the challenges brought by the highly nonlinear quadrotor position dynamics, including underactuation, coupling, nonaffine inputs, model uncertainties and external disturbances. Real flight experiments, including hover and disturbance rejection are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed UDE-based controllers.", "Biometric systems are important for access control and authentication in various application scenarios. Single biometrics can be selected for authentication, but a multimodal approach is typically more reliable. In this paper, a multimodal biometric authentication system is developed. It consists of wireless sensor nodes equipped with accelerometers and infrared cameras, which enable analysis of gait and vein scanning for authentication. Observed error equal rates for the gait and vein authentication are 13% and 11% respectively, whilst the equal error rate for the combined metrics is 8%.", "Twitter's hashtag functionality is now used for a very wide variety of purposes, from covering crises and other breaking news events through gathering an instant community around shared media texts (such as sporting events and TV broadcasts) to signalling emotive states from amusement to despair. These divergent uses of the hashtag are increasingly recognised in the literature, with attention paid especially to the ability for hashtags to facilitate the creation of ad hoc or hashtag publics. A more comprehensive understanding of these different uses of hashtags has yet to be developed, however. Previous research has explored the potential for a systematic analysis of the quantitative metrics that could be generated from processing a series of hashtag datasets. Such research found, for example, that crisis-related hashtags exhibited a significantly larger incidence of retweets and tweets containing URLs than hashtags relating to televised events, and on this basis hypothesised that the information-seeking and -sharing behaviours of Twitter users in such different contexts were substantially divergent. This article updates such study and their methodology by examining the communicative metrics of a considerably larger and more diverse number of hashtag datasets, compiled over the past five years. This provides an opportunity both to confirm earlier findings, as well as to explore whether hashtag use practices may have shifted subsequently as Twitter's userbase has developed further; it also enables the identification of further hashtag types beyond the \"crisis\" and \"mainstream media event\" types outlined to date. The article also explores the presence of such patterns beyond recognised hashtags, by incorporating an analysis of a number of keyword-based datasets. This large-scale, comparative approach contributes towards the establishment of a more comprehensive typology of hashtags and their publics, and the metrics it describes will also be able to be used to classify new hashtags emerging in the future. In turn, this may enable researchers to develop systems for automatically distinguishing newly trending topics into a number of event types, which may be useful for example for the automatic detection of acute crises and other breaking news events.", "Wide-field optical flow information can benefit the navigation of small or micro unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-degraded/denied environments, inspired by the study of insect/bird flights. This paper focuses on a flight-test evaluation of navigation information in wide-field optical flow, using flight data collected by a wide-angle camera installed on a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle at altitudes ranging from 30 to 183m above the ground. A comprehensive evaluation methodology is proposed for the comparison between optical flows computed from videos and the reference motion fields determined from conventional navigation sensors including GPS, a laser range finder, and inertial sensors. Seven sets of unmanned aerial vehicle flight data including a total of approximately 72,000 image frames are used for both full-flight temporal evaluation and representative interframe spatial evaluation of wide-field optical flow information for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation purposes. The evaluation results showed a good match between vision-derived optical flows and reference motion fields from conventional navigation sensors. Finally, one benchmark data set is shared at the authors' website for open access from the research community.", "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality, but its genetic etiology is largely unknown and likely complex involving multiple genes. The Kcna1 gene encodes Kv1.1 potassium channels that act to dampen neuronal excitability whereas the Scn2a gene encodes Nav1.2 sodium channels important for action potential conduction. We tested the hypothesis that subclinical Scn2a heterozygosity reduces SUDEP incidence in Kcna1-null mice of SUDEP, by suppressing neurocardiac dysfunction associated with the absence of Kv1.1 channels. SUDEP-prone Kcna1-null mice exhibited about a 50% increase in lifespan when heterozygous for the Scn2a-null allele, that is Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-). In simultaneous video electroencephalography (EEG)-electrocardiography (ECG) recordings, Scn2a heterozygosity did not eliminate seizures in Kcna1(-/-)mice, but seizure burden was partially reduced due to a significant reduction in seizure durations. Analysis of beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that Kcna1(-/-) and Scn2a(+/-), Kcna1(-/-) mice exhibit similarly high RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences), suggesting the functional interactions between the two mutations do not involve significant alteration of parasympathetic tone. Moreover, analysis of EEG-ECG interaction dynamics revealed a significantly higher degree of association between brain and cardiac activity in double mutant mice compared to Kcna1(-/-)animals for several different measures, suggesting that Scn2a-null heterozygosity reduces SUDEP risk by altering neural control of the heart. These findings expand our understanding of the complex genetic interactions underlying SUDEP and identify EEG-ECG association as a potential new biomarker of SUDEP susceptibility.", "Dense optical flow is a crucial visual cue for obstacle avoidance and motion control for robotic systems functioning in complex unstructured environments. In order to compute image motion for modern highly dynamic robots, it is necessary to use high speed vision systems. To perceive small and thin objects such as tree branches, fence poles, and other similar objects, high resolution vision systems must be used. The data stream from a high-resolution, high-speed vision system will saturate the onboard data bus and overload the onboard processor of almost all existing robotic systems. To implement such a vision system, we believe it is necessary to process the data in situ at the camera using dedicated processing hardware, a vision processing paradigm that we term rapid embedded vision (REV) systems. Even then, the task of processing multiple hundred hertz of dense high-resolution images is not possible using classical algorithms and classical computing hardware. A new processing paradigm that actively exploits the high frame rate of the image sequences, and high performance computing hardware such as GPU or FPGA must be employed. This letter proposes a filtering algorithm for the computation of dense optical flow fields in real time. The filter is designed as a pyramidal structure of update and propagation loops, where an optical flow state is constantly refined with new image data from the camera. The computational properties of the proposed algorithm makes it well suited for implementation in GPU and FPGA systems. We present results from a GPU implementation achieving frame rates in the order of 800 Hz at VGA resolution. Experimental validation and comparison is provided for both synthetic and real life high speed video sequences at frame rates of 300 Hz and 1016 x 544 pixel resolution.", "Open source communities rely on the espoused premise of complete openness and transparency of source code and development process. Yet, openness and transparency at times need to be balanced out with moments of less open and transparent work. Through our detailed study of Linux Kernel development, we build a theory that explains that transparency and openness are nuanced and changing qualities that certain developers manage as they use multiple digital technologies and create, in moments of needs, more opaque and closed digital spaces of work. We refer to these spaces as digital folds. Our paper contributes to the extant literature by providing a process theory of how transparency and openness are balanced with opacity and closure in open source communities according to the needs of the development work; by conceptualizing the nature of digital folds and their role in providing quiet spaces of work; and, by articulating how the process of digital folding and unfolding is made far more possible by select elite actors' navigating the line between the pragmatics of coding and the accepted ideology of openness and transparency.", "Here we present a novel bio-inspired optic flow (OF) sensor and its application to visual. guidance and odometry on a low-cost car-like robot called BioCarBot. The minimalistic OF sensor was robust to high-dynamic-range lighting conditions and to various visual patterns encountered thanks to its M(2)APIX auto-adaptive pixels and the new cross-correlation OF algorithm implemented. The low-cost car-like robot estimated its velocity and steering angle, and therefore its position and orientation, via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) using only two downward-facing OF sensors and the Ackerman steering model. Indoor and outdoor experiments were carried out in which the robot was driven in the closed-loop mode based on the velocity and steering angle estimates. The experimental results obtained show that our novel OF sensor can deliver high-frequency measurements (>300 Hz) in a wide OF range (1.5-15 rad s(-1)) and in a 7-decade high-dynamic light level range. The OF resolution was constant and could be adjusted as required (up to 0.05 rad s(-1)), and the OF precision obtained was relatively high (standard deviation of 0.17 rad s(-1) with an average OF of 4.5 rad s(-1), under the most demanding lighting conditions). An EKF-based algorithm gave the robot's position and orientation with a relatively high accuracy (maximum errors outdoors at a very low light level: 0.95 mand 0.58 rad over about 32 mand 8 pi rad) despite the low-resolution control systems of the steering servo and the DC motor, as well as a simplified model identification and calibration. Finally, the minimalistic OF-based odometry results were compared to those obtained using measurements based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a motor's speed sensor.", null, "The challenges in deploying robust wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in agricultural environments are limited power supply and variability of wireless propagation channel that restrict performance. Proposed protocols do not meet the challenges for realistic simulation and evaluation of WSN for agricultural applications. The design of LEACH protocol is, for the most part, efficient for many applications. It achieves energy efficiency through a clustering technique with TDMA based MAC layer algorithms and data aggregation method. Analysis performed shows that LEACH uses simple radio propagation and energy models that are unrealistic. This paper focuses on the performance analysis of LEACH protocol for agricultural environments.", "We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry. Here we describe the implementation and performance of the method on a hovering robot equipped with eight 0.65 g optic-flow sensors, and show that it can be used for closed-loop control of various motions.", "Virtual, remote and hands-on experimentation can be equally important and interesting for students of control engineering.

Second, we explore the specific activities that help attract a community and encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding campaign.

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system.

This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR.

IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017.

Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and pi/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels.

Open source models for tangible products are still in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and founders of twenty-three companies were interviewed to understand their motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2) Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur whose identity is as a for-profit company leader.", "This article describes the design of a low-cost USB-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat which can measure or apply potentials in the range of +/- 8 V, and measure or apply currents ranging from nanoamps to max. +/- 25 mA.

Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20 degrees platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation.

Geographically distributed open hardware communities often conduct user feedback and peer critique sessions via video conference.

Yet the focus on agency often glosses over the constraints placed on agents, particularly within asymmetrical power relations. This article follows the case of BabyLegs, a do-it-yourself monitoring tool for marine microplastic pollution, and the attempt to keep the technology open source within an intellectual property (IP) system set up to privatize it. The tactics used to design BabyLegs as a feminine, silly, doll-tool to discredit the device in the eyes of an IP system that valued traditional gender roles lead to the eventual success of keeping the device open source. Yet, those same tactics also reinforced and reproduced the structures of power and essentialism they were designed to resist. I characterize this technological ambivalence as compromise, and argue that all agency exercised within asymmetrical power relations is compromised. This is not to say resistance is futile, but that agency is never pure, and this recognition lets us be more intentional in how we might compromise as practitioners of diverse scientific knowledges.", "This paper proposes a new software platform to control and monitor a squad of unmanned vehicles.

As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

Novelty of the work lies in segregating the subjects who had good cardiovascular health and the subjects who were at risk. In the proposed work, VPG signals and other general information such as weight, height, BP were collected from 38 individuals in the post-adolescent age group. Furthermore, a signal from a person who was known to have good cardio vascular health was collected. This signal became the reference that was used to compare with other signals. After the initial pre-processing, the PPG and APG were obtained from the VPG. Then a total of 7 features of the wave contour from the APG and PPG signals were extracted. Based on the Augmentation Index the signals were classified into two classes using SVM and ELM classifiers. Where one class represented healthy individuals and the other class represents the individuals at risk of CVD. The average values of the extracted features were used and the final accuracy obtained was also an average value. The accuracy obtained using ELM classifier with K-fold cross validation was 77%. Whereas the efficiency achieved using SVM was 94.59%.

In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things.

While this is a classic problem with some solutions in the case of no constraints, it becomes interesting for embedded computing and cyber-physical systems where we aim to accelerate applications while maintaining energy efficency and also easy programmability. Currently, the AXIOM platform consists of a custom board based on the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ ZU9EG which incorporates the largest FPGA avaialable on that System-on-Chip at the moment, four 64-bit ARM cores and two 32-bit ARM cores, up to 32GiB of main memory and several 12.5Gbitis tranceivers. We relyed on this hardware to develop our novel concept, which exploitsdataflow execution in multiple ways for programs that are written in an OpenMP extension, known as OmpSs. A key aspect relates to the adopted memory consistency model, which allows the programmer to focus on aspects other than taking care of the communication among nodes. The lower level of our communication stack relies on a fast interconnect based on inexpensive USB-C type connectors rather than on other proprietary interfaces. The reconfigurable logic provides a complete Network Interface Card (NIC) to allow fast routing of the data and code of the system.

The current work has an immediate application in solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem which is one of the challenging problems in the field of robotics. In this work, a set of RF sensors utilizing the ZigBee protocol are placed in an indoor environment and a base RF sensor is mounted within a rotating parabolic reflector on a mobile robot. The proposed range and bearing approximation framework works in two cascaded phases. In the first phase, the base RF sensor sends an RF signal to all other RF sensors within its operating range. These RF sensors then respond to the base RF module where ZigBee packets are parsed to store raw data for approximating range. In the second phase, a stepper motor is employed to rotate the parabolic reflector and the base RF sensor mounted on the robot. These two phases continue until a full revolution of 360 degrees has been achieved. The data is processed for approximating the bearing of each RF sensor with respect to the mobile robot's heading angle, as well as the distance (range) to the RF sensor at its associated bearing.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience.

This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.", null, "As the population density continues to grow in the urban settings, air quality is degrading and becoming a serious issue. Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has raised a series of concerns for public health. As a result, a number of large-scale, low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed in several international smart city projects. One of the major challenges for such environmental sensing systems is ensuring the data quality. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework (ADF) for large-scale, real-world environmental sensing systems. The framework is composed of four modules: 1) time-sliced anomaly detection (TSAD), which detects spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal anomalies in the real-time sensor measurement data stream; 2) real-time emission detection, which detects potential regional emission sources; 3) device ranking, which provides a ranking for each sensing device; and 4) malfunction detection, which identifies malfunctioning devices. Using real world measurement data from the AirBox project, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively identify outliers in the raw measurement data as well as infer anomalous events that are perceivable by the general public and government authorities. Because of its simple design, ADF is highly extensible to other advanced applications, and it can be exploited to support various large-scale environmental sensing systems.", "The advancement of embedded system technologies, sensing techniques and wireless technologies provide new possibilities to monitor human activities at all times.

Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms-and underperform-the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.", null, "In the recent years a major change in the engineering process of mechatronics and robotics has taken place.

Most farmers must assume the high cost of the required equipment in order to be able to streamline natural resources on their farms. Considering that many farmers cannot afford to install this equipment, it is necessary to look for more effective solutions that would be cheaper to implement. The objective of this study is to build virtual organizations of agents that can communicate between each other while monitoring crops. A low cost sensor architecture allows farmers to monitor and optimize the growth of their crops by streamlining the amount of resources the crops need at every moment. Since the hardware has limited processing and communication capabilities, our approach uses the PANGEA architecture to overcome this limitation. Specifically, we will design a system that is capable of collecting heterogeneous information from its environment, using sensors for temperature, solar radiation, humidity, pH, moisture and wind. A major outcome of our approach is that our solution is able to merge heterogeneous data from sensors and produce a response adapted to the context. In order to validate the proposed system, we present a case study in which farmers are provided with a tool that allows us to monitor the condition of crops on a TV screen using a low cost device.", "Critical approaches to the smart city concept are used to begin highlighting the promises of makerspaces, that is to say, those emerging urban sites that promote sharing practices; exercise community-based forms of governance; and utilize local manufacturing technologies.

Computer vision provides a number of benefits over conventionally used sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) or a Motion Capture System (MCS), in order to achieve state estimation and localization relative to a scene. Our work uses the output of an existing Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) system which provides a scaled position measurement. We propose an observer design to estimate vehicle position and linear velocity. The observer fuses an accelerometer measurement from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and VSLAM system output. The observer depends on an attitude estimate from an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). A change of coordinates is used to transform the system into a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) form. Using these coordinates we consider the observability of the Visual Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VISLAM) problem. Two observer designs are proposed and their performance is validated in simulation and experiment. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the fact that crowdsensing approaches could be an adequate solution for urban areas, they cannot be implemented in rural environments. Instead, deploying a fleet of UAVs could be considered an acceptable alternative. Embracing this approach, this paper proposes the use of UAVs equipped with off-the-shelf sensors to perform air pollution monitoring tasks. These UAVs are guided by our proposed Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC) algorithm, which is based on a chemotaxis metaheuristic and a local particle swarm optimization strategy. Together, they allow automatically performing the monitoring of a specified area using UAVs. Experimental results show that, when using PdUC, an implicit priority guides the construction of pollution maps by focusing on areas where the pollutants' concentration is higher. This way, accurate maps can be constructed in a faster manner when compared to other strategies. The PdUC scheme is compared against various standard mobility models through simulation, showing that it achieves better performance. In particular, it is able to find the most polluted areas with more accuracy and provides a higher coverage within the time bounds defined by the UAV flight time.", "Automotive instrumentation is an important process to guarantee quality and safety for the drivers and passengers of vehicles. At the same time, it is a time-consuming task, because engineers must setup the system, which includes the passing of cables through the vehicle and the configuration of equipments. A wireless automotive instrumentation system can certainly help on reducing the instrumentation time and its cost. However, it may incur in errors due to the wireless communication between sensors and the base station. In this study, the authors propose a low-cost wireless monitoring system for automotive instrumentation.

In particular, the highly dynamic nature of generation and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy resources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved through demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential overload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of this mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is nevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid and its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an interactive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in order to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze data being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain insights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems. The outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential buildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of hardware measurement units and a management software.

We unearth everyday 'how-to' guidance to interweave circular practices within makerspaces from the outset by: fostering an enabling culture; building local connections; nurturing individual/community capacities; and stimulating practical know-how. However, while the research reveals immense opportunities to cultivate circular literacy from within makerspaces, the prospects to ask more profound questions about our economy, through makerspace practices, are found to be compromised by day-today concerns. The insights from this research can act as a starting point for future work in this emerging research area.", "In animal behavioral biology, an automated observing/training system may be useful for several reasons: (a) continuous observation of animals for documentation of specific, irregular events, (b) long-term intensive training of animals in preparation for behavioral experiments, (c) elimination of potential cues and biases induced by humans during training and testing. Here, we describe an open-source-based system named CATOS (Computer Aided Training/Observing System) developed for such situations. There are several notable features in this system. CATOS is flexible and low cost because it is based on free open-source software libraries, common hardware parts, and open-system electronics based on Arduino. Automated video condensation is applied, leading to significantly reduced video data storage compared to the total active hours of the system. A data-viewing utility program helps a user browse recorded data quickly and more efficiently. With these features, CATOS has the potential to be applied to many different animal species in various environments such as laboratories, zoos, or even private homes. Also, an animal's free access to the device without constraint, and a gamified learning process, enhance the animal's welfare and enriches their environment. As a proof of concept, the system was built and tested with two different species. Initially, the system was tested for approximately 10 months with a domesticated cat. The cat was successfully and fully automatically trained to discriminate three different spoken words. Then, in order to test the system's adaptability to other species and hardware components, we used it to train a laboratory rat for 3 weeks.", "Are the dynamics that underlie commons-based peer production in materially deprived societies the same as those at work in affluent settings? This article contributes to the debate on open development and commons-based peer production by drawing on an in-depth case study of Map Kibera, a popular citizen engagement and citizen mapping project in Nairobi, Kenya. Combining insights from the literature on peer production and participatory development, this examination of the empirical ndings focuses on three dimensions of information co-creation: participant motivations, the relationship between product-oriented versus process-oriented views of participation, and the governance of localized global public goods in economically resource-poor settings. This article provides a basis for greater conceptual clarity regarding the dynamics of open development in poor communities and a reconsideration of the appropriateness of a value-driven framework of commons-based peer production in materially deprived settings.", "Getting cities and communities smarter is a strategic but also very complex process that involves several actors (e.g., governments, industries, scientific researchers) and addresses many challenges. Among these, energy efficiency and cost-saving are mandatory. Following this line, in this paper we propose a novel energy-aware management system, we name Energy Saving Smart Building (ESSB), for smart environments. ore specifically, we present its experimental use at University of Messina in order to optimize the use of all the electrical equipments. The results are the reduction of energy consumption and costs improving comfort and sustainability in smart office environments.", "Continuous monitoring of earth flow displacement is essential for the understanding of the dynamic of the process, its ongoing evolution and designing mitigation measures. Despite its importance, it is not always applied due to its expense and the need for integration with additional sensors to monitor factors controlling movement. To overcome these problems, we developed and tested a low-cost Arduino-based wire-rail extensometer integrating a data logger, a power system and multiple digital and analog inputs. The system is equipped with a high-precision position transducer that in the test configuration offers a measuring range of 1023mm and an associated accuracy of +/- 1 mm, and integrates an operating temperature sensor that should allow potential thermal drift that typically affects this kind of systems to be identified and corrected. A field test, conducted at the Pietrafitta earth flow where additional monitoring systems had been installed, indicates a high reliability of the measurement and a high monitoring stability without visible thermal drift.", "Pushed by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm modern sensor networks monitor a wide range of phenomena, in areas such as environmental monitoring, health care, industrial processes, and smart cities. These networks provide a continuous pulse of the almost infinite activities that are happening in the physical space and are thus, key enablers for a Digital Earth Nervous System. Nevertheless, the rapid processing of these sensor data streams still continues to challenge traditional data-handling solutions and new approaches are being requested. We propose a generic answer to this challenge, which has the potential to support any form of distributed real-time analysis. This neutral methodology follows a brokering approach to work with different kinds of data sources and uses web-based standards to achieve interoperability. As a proof of concept, we implemented the methodology to detect anomalies in real-time and applied it to the area of environmental monitoring. The developed system is capable of detecting anomalies, generating notifications, and displaying the recent situation to the user.", "In this paper, a set of digital artifacts related to simple examples of structural engineering are presented. The artifacts are real-time applications and visualizations of typical problems students from the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) schools are acquainted with. The real-time nature of the examples allow a high level of interaction between humans and the classic visualization of results, namely, bending and shear force diagrams, internal stresses distributions, and contour plots. These artifacts may provide in AEC a twofold educational target: (i) for users, to provide visual understanding in real time of typical problems that must be understood in classic lectures of structural engineering; (ii) for developers, to provide meaningful applications of applied digital fabrication using sensors, microcontrollers, and GUI's and their potential in the development of tools related to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and the Internet of Things (IoT) among students of the AEC sector.", "Emerging network services and subsequent growth in the networking infrastructure have gained tremendous momentum in recent years. Application performance requiring rapid real-time network provisioning, optimized traffic management, and virtualization of shared resources has induced the conceptualization and adoption of new networking models. Software defined networking (SDN), one of the predominant and relatively new networking paradigms, seeks to simplify network management by decoupling network control logic from the underlying hardware and introduces real-time network programmability enabling innovation. The present work reviews the state of the art in software defined networking providing a historical perspective on complementary technologies in network programmability and the inherent shortcomings which paved the way for SDN. The SDN architecture is discussed along with popular protocols, platforms, and existing simulation and debugging solutions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is presented around recent SDN development and deployment avenues ranging from mobile communications and data centers to campus networks and residential environments. The review concludes by highlighting implementation challenges and subsequent research directions being pursued in academia and industry to address issues related to application performance, control plane scalability and design, security, and interdomain connectivity in the context of SDN.", "The introduction of mobile devices has changed our daily lives. They enable users to obtain information even in a nomadic environment and provide information without limitations. A decade after the introduction of this technology, we are now facing the next innovation that will change our daily lives. With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), our communication ability will not be restricted to only mobile devices. Rather, it will expand to all things with which we coexist. Many studies have discussed IoT-related services and platforms. However, there are only limited discussions about the IoT network.

Yet, an understanding of enabling technologies involved in the engagement of citizens appear largely outside of the realm of air pollution. Recently, different air pollution projects have been rolled out in Europe and abroad; a structured analysis, however, of the way citizens are involved in these type of projects does not yet exist. In contribution to the ongoing EU-Funded project hackAlR, this paper therefore explores this research gap on the topic of air pollution and citizen science through the following question: Which engagement mechanisms can be identified in existing air pollution citizen science projects? We combine multiple literature sources, employ a systematic case study analysis and conduct seven qualitative interviews with key experts to target citizen science projects related to air pollution. Several mechanisms emerged at the interface between air pollution, citizen participation and knowledge production. These include: (1) Scale, (2) User-involvement and co-creation, (3) Communication, and (4) User motivation and aspects of behaviour. Despite its growing reputation in digital innovation, a majority of the mapped projects do not explicitly engage in any co-creation process. Multiple project insights suggest the importance of non-academic stakeholders as agents for communication and engagement. Campaign-based gamification can prove successful in establishing urgency in local contexts. Common engagement barriers include issues in the data contribution, science communication, technical project limitations, scaling and the critical nature of distributed sensors. This preliminary research offers a fruitful approach in assessing and comparing initiatives, and can enrich our understanding of the contribution that air pollution technology can have in citizen science.", "This paper describes the design of a hexacopter platform for air quality measurement purposes outfitted with gear that allows it to fly at altitudes up to 5000 meters above sea level (MASL). The multicopter is equipped with sensing technology to monitor the quality of the air, thus, presenting itself as a portable and easy-to-position in 3-dimensional environments alternative to high-cost static monitoring stations. Aside from the design considerations regarded to allow the aircraft to fly at high altitudes, a methodology is presented to describe the process concerning air quality data acquisition. This work features an analysis of the performance of the hexacopter by scrutinizing data from flight tests held at high-altitude and sea level locations and an analysis of results from the values obtained by the drone's low-cost sensors, which are compared against the data obtained from professional equipment certified by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency of United States) from SENAMHI, the local regulatory entity in Peru.", "Aiming at realizing intellectualized control of granary ventilation and eliminating the flaws such as low efficiency, technological obsolescence and structural incompleteness in traditional system, this paper brings forward a new control system for granary ventilation with advanced embedded Linux technology, embedded networking technology, and Qt technology.

In the context of the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment, a versatile small form factor Timing and Fast-Control (TFC) interfacing FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) was developed, offering bidirectional twisted-pair (TP) links for the communication between TFC nodes. Also a versatile clocking including voltage controlled oscillators and a connection to the telecommunication clock lines of mTCA crates are available. Being designed for both TFC Master and Slaves, the card allows rapid system developments without additional Slave hardware circuits. Measurements show that it is possible to transmit over cable lengths of 25m at a rate of 240 Mbit/s for all data channels simultaneously. A TFC Master-Slave system using two of these cards can be synchronized with a precision of +/- 10 ps to an user-defined phase setpoint.", "The Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA) is a C4ISR-focused technical and economic collaborative effort between the Air Force, Navy, Army, the Department of Defense (DoD), Industry, and other Governmental agencies to develop (and incorporate) a technical Open Systems Architecture standard in order to maximize C4ISR sub-system, system, and platform affordability, re-configurability, and hardware/software/firmware re-use. The SOSA effort will effectively create an operational and technical framework for the integration of disparate payloads into C4ISR systems; with a focus on the development of a modular decomposition (defining functions and behaviors) and associated key interfaces (physical and logical) for common multi-purpose architecture for radar, EO/IR, SIGINT, EW, and Communications. SOSA addresses hardware, software, and mechanical/electrical interfaces. The modular decomposition will produce a set of re-useable components, interfaces, and sub-systems that engender reusable capabilities. This, in effect, creates a realistic and affordable ecosystem enabling mission effectiveness through systematic re-use of all available re-composed hardware, software, and electrical/mechanical base components and interfaces. To this end, SOSA will leverage existing standards as much as possible and evolve the SOSA architecture through modification, reuse, and enhancements to achieve C4ISR goals. This paper will present accomplishments over the first year of SOSA initiative.", "Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator.", null, "A 1-year data set of ground-based GPS signal observations aiming at geometric elevation angles below +2 degrees is analysed. Within the \"GLESER\" measurement campaign about 2600 validated setting events were recorded by the \"OpenGPS\" open-loop tracking receiver at an observation site located at 52.3808 degrees N, 13.0642 degrees E between January and December 2014. The measurements confirm the feasibility of open-loop signal tracking down to geometric elevation angles of -1 to -1.5 degrees extending the corresponding closed-loop tracking range by up to 1 degrees. The study is based on the premise that observations of low-elevation events by a ground-based receiver may serve as test cases for space-based radio occultation measurements, even if the latter proceed at a significantly faster temporal scale. The results support the conclusion that the open-loop Doppler model has negligible influence on the derived carrier frequency profile for strong signal-to-noise density ratios above about 30 dB Hz. At lower signal levels, however, the OpenGPS receiver's dual-channel design, which tracks the same signal using two Doppler models differing by 10 Hz, uncovers a notable bias. The repeat patterns of the GPS orbit traces in terms of azimuth angle reveal characteristic signatures in both signal amplitude and Doppler frequency with respect to the topography close to the observation site. Mean vertical refractivity gradients, extracted from ECMWF meteorological fields, correlate weakly to moderately with observed signal amplitude fluctuations at geometric elevation angles between +1 and +2 degrees. Results from multiple phase screen simulations support the interpretation that these fluctuations are at least partly produced by atmospheric multipath; at negative elevation angles diffraction at the ground surface seems to contribute.", "Edge computing is considered as a technology to enable new types of services which operate at the network edge. There are important use cases in ambient intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) for edge computing driven by huge business potentials. Most of today's edge computing platforms, however, consist of proprietary gateways, which are either closed or fairly restricted to deploy any third-party services. In this paper we discuss a participatory edge computing system running on home gateways to serve as an open environment to deploy local services. We present first motivating use cases and review existing approaches and design considerations for the proposed system. Then we show our platform which materializes the principles of an open and participatory edge environment, to lower the entry barriers for service deployment at the network edge. By using containers, our platform can flexibly enable third-party services, and may serve as an infrastructure to support several application domains of ambient intelligence. 1877-0509 (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.", "First responders and other emergency services personnel must often enter buildings which prevent the use of GPS or other satellite navigation signals for positioning. Loss of navigation capability combined with the fact that the buildings are often unknown to the personnel in question makes it more difficult for individual team members to coordinate with one another, and difficult or impossible for the team leader to monitor and direct the actions of each team member. While inertial navigation or pedestrian dead reckoning provide for some degree of navigation in GPS signal denied environments, these solutions degrade with time and may require prohibitively large and expensive inertial solutions to navigate over extended periods, while also allowing each individual user to accumulate independent positioning errors and thereby appearing to 'drift away' from one another. This paper presents an implementation of a collaborative navigation system utilizing each of user-to-user radio links, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) when available, inertial navigation, pedestrian dead reckoning, as well as camera based Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) to provide a team of users with absolute and relative situational awareness for themselves and their team. The application of collaborative navigation to such a team provides the triple benefits of providing improved absolute navigation accuracy, improved relative navigation accuracy, and greatly enhanced situational awareness for all cooperating team members.", "Distributed manufacturing, where decentralized small, local sites are engaged in production, often supported by digital systems and networks, can be a powerful tool in humanitarian aid. Field Ready uses distributed manufacturing to produce essential non-food items locally where they are needed during humanitarian responses. Such supplies can be available to communities in need and to relief workers more quickly, more cheaply than alternatives, and provide appropriate solutions to problems, often engaging local people in designing and making necessary items, and supporting economic development. Scaling up this requires local production capabilities (skills, tools, and information such as designs), which can be boosted by adoption of these methods by aid agencies, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and others. Local manufacturing offers the potential for disaster affected communities to be engaged in recovery, and long term to become more resilient, with access to all the equipment and information required to make the supplies they need. However, there are challenges: appropriate quality control for distributed manufacture, unlocking the potential for in-region manufacturers to engage in humanitarian response, and uptake of digital knowledge sharing and collaboration to the humanitarian sector. In this paper, we share experiences of human-centred design and global collaboration to solve local problems, of manufacturing in remote and challenging locations, community building and bridging sectors through the Humanitarian Makers network, and new ideas for distributed manufacturing standards and quality.", "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cloud technologies today provide new options for remote measurement data collection, storage and processing.

In Internet user communities, users increasingly review smartphone functions and share information about their experiences such as complaints, problems, and satisfaction, and these user experiences have been fruitful sources for manufacturers that lead to smartphone improvements. Focusing on these user experiences, this paper proposes a systematic roadmapping process including prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements. By prioritising smartphone feature requirements, new and improved versions of smartphones that reflect user needs can be planned based on a product-market roadmap. The systematic approach consists of three parts: user-driven quality function deployment (QFD), a frequent pattern (FP)-tree algorithm, and a product-market roadmap. First, we collected data extracted from text mining in Internet user communities to construct a user-driven QFD. Second, using user experiences related to smartphone features, we applied the FP-tree algorithm to algorithmically derive a priority list of smartphone feature requirements. Finally, based on the result of the FP-tree of smartphones, we proposed guidelines to construct a product-market roadmap. It is expected that a versioning strategy can be formulated through this prioritised product-market roadmap. Furthermore, covering each step from data collection to roadmapping, this study suggests a systematic process for prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements based on user experiences.", "The high stakes of emergent environmental crises, from climate change to widespread toxic exposures, have motivated STS practitioners to innovate methodologically, including leveraging STS scholarship to actively remake environmental scientific practice and technologies. This thematic collection brings together current research that transforms how communities and academics identify, study, and collectively respond to contaminants engendered by the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, including air contamination from hydraulic fracking, marine pollution from petroleum-derived plastics, and hydrocarbon derivatives such as formaldehyde that intoxicate our homes. These interventions make inroads into the \"undone science\" and \"regimes of imperceptibility\" of environmental health crises. Authors, most of whom are practitioners, investigate grassroots methods for collaboratively designing and developing low-cost monitoring tools, crowdsourcing data analysis, and imagining ways of redressing toxicity outside of the idioms of science.

Future IoT platforms should thus provide connectivity and intelligence. One approach to connecting IoT devices, IoT networks to cloud networks and services is to use network federation mechanisms over the internet to create network slices across heterogeneous platforms. Network slices also need to be protected from potential external and internal threats. In this paper we describe an approach for enforcing global security policies in the federated cloud and IoT networks. Our approach allows a global security to be defined in the form of a single service manifest and enforced across all federation network segments. It relies on network function virtualisation (NFV) and service function chaining (SFC) to enforce the security policy. The approach is illustrated with two case studies: one for a user that wishes to securely access IoT devices and another in which an IoT infrastructure administrator wishes to securely access some remote cloud and data analytics services.", "Is it possible to create an ant robot which can leave \"scents\" behind?

We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlated with clinical improvement.", "ResultsDystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (=0.4, p=0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (=0.5, p=0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (=0.23, p=0.002), which coincided with 3 previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets.

The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm(2) for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm(2). The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 degrees C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Consuming minimum gasoline during the trip is a common goal for most energy management controllers. To achieve these objectives, an intelligent energy management controller for EREV based on dynamic programming and neural networks (IEMC_NN) is proposed. The power demand split ratio between the extender and battery are optimized by DP, and the control objectives are presented as a cost function. The online controller is trained by neural networks. Three trained controllers, constructing the controller library in IEMC_NN, are obtained from training three typical lengths of the driving cycle. To determine an appropriate NN controller for different driving distance purposes, the selection module in IEMC_NN is developed based on the remaining battery energy and the driving distance to the charging station. Three simulation conditions are adopted to validate the performance of IEMC_NN. They are target driving distance information, known and unknown, changing the destination during the trip. Simulation results using these simulation conditions show that the IEMC_NN had better fuel economy than the charging deplete/charging sustain (CD/CS) algorithm. More significantly, with known driving distance information, the battery SOC controlled by IEMC_NN can just reach the lower bound as the EREV arrives at the charging station, which was also feasible when the driver changed the destination during the trip.", "This paper presents a technical overview of Team DRC-Hubo@UNLV's approach to the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals (DRC-Finals).

A new perception head design (optimized for the tasks of the Finals) and its data processing are then presented. In the motion planning and control aspect, various techniques, such as wheel-driven navigation, zero-moment-point (ZMP) -based locomotion, and position-based manipulation and controls, are described in this paper. By introducing strategically critical elements and key lessons learned from DRC-Trials 2013 and the testbed of Charleston, we also illustrate how DRC-Hubo has evolved successfully toward the DRC-Finals.

As long as complex systems such as drones will increase to become an integral part of the social context, it is particularly evident that such technologies should be aware and able to reason on and adhere to rules of law, trust and ethical principles any time they perform a task or service. This drone development framework will pave the way for a new generation of development methodologies much more devoted to smart society technologies and able to model the contextual knowledge that surrounds and affects the complex system's behaviors.", "Fab Labs, fabrication laboratories, are shared workshops where citizens can access digital fabrication equipment to design and make their own objects. They are proliferating rapidly and represent an alternative to mass production and consumption, an ideology whose environmental and social benefits their \"makers\" like to espouse. A longitudinal ethnographic study in a Fab Lab in a European design school examined the Lab's ideology building, how ideals were enacted and where compromises were visible. Environmental issues were intertwined with other ideological concerns, but they were rarely promoted in their own right. Engagement with sustainability-oriented makers and stakeholders is recommended.", "Traditionally, most irrigation practices in Southern Europe have been based on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization.", null, "The current standard protocols for characterizing the optogenetic circuit of bacterial cells using flow cytometry in light tubes and light exposure of culture plates are tedious, labor-intensive, and cumbersome. In this work, we engineer a bioreactor with working volume of similar to 10 mL for in vivo real-time optogenetic characterization of E. coli with a CcaS-CcaR light-sensing system. In the bioreactor, optical density measurements, reporter protein fluorescence detection, and light input stimuli are provided by four light-emitting diode sources and two photodetectors. Once calibrated, the device can cultivate microbial cells and record their growth and gene expression without human intervention. We measure gene expression during cell growth with different organic substrates (glucose, succinate, acetate, pyruvate) as carbon sources in minimal medium and the optogenetic circuit by serial dilution passages. demonstrate evolutionary tuning of the optogenetic circuit by serial dilution passages.", "Recent research has provided solid evidence that emotions strongly affect motivation and engagement, and hence play an important role in learning. In BIG-AFF project, we build on the hypothesis that \"it is possible to provide learners with a personalised support that enriches their learning process and experience by using low intrusive (and low cost) devices to capture affective multimodal data that include cognitive, behavioural and physiological information\". In order to deal with the affect management complete cycle, thus covering affect detection, modelling and feedback, there is lack of standards and consolidated methodologies. Being our goal to develop realistic affect-aware learning environments, we are exploring different approaches on how these can be supported by either by traditional non-intrusive interaction sources or low intrusive and inexpensive sensing devices. In this work we describe the main issues involved in two user studies carried out with high school learners, highlight some open problems that arose when designing the corresponding experimental settings. In particular, the studies involved varied nature of information sources and each focused on one of the approaches. Our experience reflects the need to develop an extensive knowledge about the organization of this type of experiences that consider user-centric development and evaluation methodologies.", "This paper presents a proposal for the development of a web system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) concepts, focused on the environmental monitoring and low cost. The need to carry out such a study is solidified by accelerated technological advancement and widespread concern with the alarming environmental conditions that the world presents today. In this system, groups of sensors are responsible for, through embedded systems, send the data to a server that stores them and also provides graphical interface models on a web page. The implementation of such a procedure allows for a better understanding of relevant environmental characteristics of certain locations, as well as the research for better solutions to environmental issues.", "The optogenetic revolution enabled spatially-precise and temporally-precise control over protein function, signaling pathway activation, and animal behavior with tremendous success in the dissection of signaling networks and neural circuits. Very recently, optogenetic methods have been paired with optical reporters in novel drug screening platforms. In these all-optical platforms, light remotely activated ion channels and kinases thereby obviating the use of electrophysiology or reagents. Consequences were remarkable operational simplicity, throughput, and cost-effectiveness that culminated in the identification of new drug candidates. These blueprints for all-optical assays also revealed potential pitfalls and inspire all-optical variants of other screens, such as those that aim at better understanding dynamic drug action or orphan protein function.", "This paper presents the design, implementation, and incorporation of an educational control system platform in an introductory course on control systems, with the goal of relating abstract concepts involved in this course to a real-world engineering system. This study builds upon the previously published attempt by the author involving design of a general control system platform for position-controlling of a shaft. In the present work, the need for incorporating a hardware-based hands-on project for teaching control systems is discussed first. Then, the contents of the undergraduate senior-level course MECH 412 Control Systems and the way the course is organized around a master example are explained. In addition, this paper elaborates on the challenges involved with introducing the concept of microprocessors to the mechanical engineering students taking MECH 412. The term project, which is founded on the master example in question, is discussed in details with emphasis on the objectives and learning outcomes, and evaluation. In the results section, the outcomes of the implementation of the proposed platform during the Fall 2016 semester are presented. These outcomes include the various types of controllers students selected to design, the observations they made for each type of controller, samples of submitted codes, and evaluation of the students' learning outcomes. The evaluation includes the statistical analysis of pre and post-test questionnaire completed by the students at the beginning and end of the semester, respectively. The reason why a control group could not be secured is explained in detail. The statistical analysis shows a significant improvement in the mechanical engineering students' degree of the confidence in using tools that are traditionally perceived to be for electrical engineers.", "Micro Aerial Vehicles (FOV) are very suitable for flying in indoor environments, but autonomous navigation is challenging due to their strict hardware limitations. This paper presents a highly efficient computer vision algorithm called Edge-FS for the determination of velocity and depth. It runs at 20 Hz on a 4 g stereo camera with an embedded STM32F4 microprocessor (168 MHz, 192 kB) and uses edge distributions to calculate optical flow and stereo disparity. The stereo-based distance estimates are used to scale the optical flow in order to retrieve the drone's velocity. The velocity and depth measurements are used for fully autonomous flight of a 40 g pocket drone only relying on on-board sensors. This method allows the MAV to control its velocity and avoid obstacles.", "This paper presents an analysis of data collected through the Waterloo WeBike project: a field trial in which over 30 sensor-equipped electric bicycles (e-bikes) were given to members of the University of Waterloo for personal use. Our dataset includes e-bike trips and battery charging sessions spanning nearly three years, from summer 2014 until spring 2017. We also conducted three surveys both before and during the trial. Our main findings were that the primary purpose of the e-bikes in our trial was for commuting, with most trips lasting less than 20 minutes and most trips taking place in the summer months. Our battery charging analysis revealed no evidence of range anxiety, and our analysis of survey results showed little correlation between anticipated and actual use. Furthermore, when asked about their opinions about various modes of transportation, our participants rated regular bicycles higher than e-bikes even after becoming familiar with e-bikes through the field trial. Based on our analysis, we draw several conclusions, including the fact that the general population in Canada is still unaware of e-bikes and their potential. Moreover, e-bike manufacturers should target sales to nonbike users, such as seniors, rather than trying to displace sales of regular bicycles.", "Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source.", "There are many necessities that need to be improved in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. The robotics represents a promising educational tool. Nowadays, robotic education tools arise with the aim of promoting the innovation and the motivation of the students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily life; thus, it is important to integrate robots at all levels of our society. The aim of this paper is to present the use of Scratch - a widely-used tool - in order to guide educational robotics as the first step in introducing students into robotics. The robotics requires several skills such as systems thinking, programming mindset, active learning, mathematics, science, judgement and decision making, good communication, technology design, complex problem solving and persistence. These skills can be easily developed using Scratch. The obtained outcomes from the educational robotic course demonstrate how children without previous experience in programming or robotics can start learning both through experiences in the classroom. The result of this work shows that it is better to make very easy challenges, to adapt the difficulty to each of the children. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop previous concepts. Moreover, it is necessary to work the design, instead of programming directly. Additionally, it is important to combine theory and practice with the aim of including fun tasks intertwined with the challenges that are posed to apply theory in problem solving.", "Electric wheelchairs restore mobility and independence to those with injuries limiting their movement. However, individuals suffering from arthritis or motor neuron degenerative diseases e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) lack the fine motor control to fluently control electric wheelchairs. These individuals are left dependent on others, drastically reducing their independence and quality of life. This study seeks to mitigate these problems by presenting a wheelchair capable of autonomous navigation, with minimal directive from the user. The wheelchair uses the robot operating system (ROS), microcontrollers, rotary encoders, and a LIDAR unit to navigate. The LIDAR unit provides vital measurements of the environment which are used to construct a map of the surroundings. ROS receives input from the LIDAR sensor along with the rotary encoders to determine a navigable path to a user-defined destination. ROS sends movement commands to a microcontroller to move the wheelchair along the designated path. The navigation system is designed to adapt to changes in the environment and reroute the wheelchair if new obstacles emerge. During the autonomous system testing, involving ten trials, the wheelchair successfully navigated to the expected destination in 100% of the trials. Based on these preliminary results, the autonomous wheelchair has the potential to restore independent indoor mobility. Further development could provide autonomous navigation capabilities in outdoor environments.", "Searching is one of the key activities to fulfill any foraging task. When working with robots, most searching strategies depend on image processing, which is one of the most time-consuming processes. In this work, white shark hunting behaviors inspired the proposed strategy for a team of foraging robots to search and approach the objects. Based on current perceptions, a robot can speed up the foraging process by switching between its sensors to approach its target, that is, by depending less on image processing. On the other hand, the visual clues or targets in the environment have different shapes and colors to indicate which task is available. Such targets are provided by a set of landmarks that change their color according to their availability. In particular, we can manipulate the delays to show a new available task in these landmarks. Each robot makes decisions about which type of target to search based on its experiences. Robots can double-check when they identify unclear images, which are also included in the image database. The proposed strategy for search and approach surpassed the hardware limitations allowing robot navigation with little visual information. A small improvement in the foraging mechanism allowed robots to achieve faster adaptations.", "This chapter discusses the practices of silicon luthiers, the master craftspeople of electronic music. It illustrates how the design of electronic music instruments is heavily indebted to the spirit of invention that characterized electronics research before the standardization of components, and connects them with the associated engineering methodologies relevant today. Through the presentation of various sound generation schemes and interfaces, an alternate history of electronic music is drawn at the component, interface, and system level. Musicians and designers have always questioned the limits of their devices, as well as the preconceptions of what instruments could or should be: Through the development of original interfaces and unusual synthesis methods, they offered their personal visions for the field. This chapter offers a view of how these innovators helped shape the present and many futures of music technology.", "Tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to perform vertical take-off and landing and their high-speed cruising abilities, thereby presenting broad application prospects. Considering portability and applications in tasks characterized by constrained or small scope areas, this article presents a compact tricopter configuration tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with full modes of flight from the rotor mode to the fixed-wing mode and vice versa. The unique multiple modes make the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle a multi-input multi-output, non-affine, multi-channel cross coupling, and nonlinear system. Considering these characteristics, a control allocation method is designed to make the controller adaptive to the full modes of flight. To reduce the cost, the accurate dynamic model of the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle is not obtained, so a full-mode flight strategy is designed in view of this situation. An autonomous flight test was conducted, and the results indicate the satisfactory performance of the control allocation method and flight strategy.", "White or polychromatic light sources are vastly abundant in nature and lie in our most basic understanding of the theory of light, beginning from stars like our Sun and extending to every common household light bulb or street lamp. In this paper, I present concepts of white light interferometery using a common- path Sagnac interferometer, manifested in a straightforward laboratory experiment. I further show the use of this as a Fourier transform spectrometer while presenting a basic overview of the theoretical concepts and spectrum of different light sources obtained experimentally. This work, both experimentally and analytically, is suitable for upper-level undergraduate physics or engineering courses where electromagnetic theory and optics are discussed. The experiment and theory presents important deep concepts and aspects in modern optics and physics that every science student should acquire.", "The flipped classroom is a teaching methodology that has gained recognition in primary, secondary and higher education settings. The flipped classroom inverts traditional teaching methods, delivering lecture instruction outside class, and devoting class time to problem solving, with the teacher's role becoming that of a learning coach and facilitator. This methodology provides an avenue for more hands-on and student-driven learning during class time. The benefits of a flipped classroom include increased student motivation, differentiating instruction, self-pacing lessons and mastery learning, increased collaboration and instant feedback for formative assessment. Although limited research has been conducted regarding students with learning difficulties in inclusive settings using a flipped learning model, initial research indicates flipping a classroom can be beneficial. Information is provided on inclusive practices from numerous countries that are beneficial to students with learning difficulties, as well as strategies and resources for individuals who may want to implement a flipped classroom.", "Mobile devices, tablets, smart phones, and now wearable technologies have changed our world, including how we perceive and interact with others and our environment.

To implement it, it is necessary to choose good problems that will drive students' learning. These problems have to instigate students interest, encourage collaboration and help them to develop their knowledge of course-related topics. This paper presents a case study that sought to verify how the Lean Startup Idea Invalidation process applied with a Validation Board a business strategy assessment tool may assist in the choice of significant problems. Initial results indicate that this method helps students discard bad ideas, improve on the most interesting ones and choose products that are actually used by real users.", "An approach to intelligent building energy management systems at the workplace level has the potential to save energy through the use of building information modeling (BIM) and smart sensor systems. Its development focuses on micro-climatization and real-time digitalization systems from an architect's point of view. Intelligent management systems (IMSs) have significant potential for energy savings, but they have not been fully used in buildings and cities. Smart sensor systems based on user behavior will improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and user comfort. A cost-effective strategy has been implemented by using a low-technology and high-performance approach. This work aims to reduce energy consumption and provide comfort conditions by learning user behavior. Furthermore, it seeks to create a real-time system with regard to the functions of developed technologies. In order to improve energy efficiency and comfort conditions, smart sensor systems and digital simulation tools play a crucial role in finding optimal solutions to optimization problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT. We categorize here the numerous existing solutions according to their objectives (e.g. high-reliability, mobility support) and approaches. We also identify some open challenges, expected to attract much attention over the next few years.", "The continuous growth of the Internet of Things in recent years has meant it is increasingly more present, as Internet of Things scenarios such as smart homes and smart cities become part of our everyday lives. The Internet of Things devices involved can be divided into two categories in most Internet of Things scenarios. The devices can constitute a black box with specific sensors which complicates their configuration, for example, wearable products. Other Internet of Things devices can be composed through configurable microcontrollers, enabling customizable environments to be designed. However, the necessary tools and knowledge for programming and configuring microcontrollers are not accessible to everyone. This article proposes a run-time deployment and management system through the Constrained Application Protocol that bridges the gap between end users and customizable environments. With our system, end users can incorporate new sensors or actuators in their installed microcontroller without having to access and program the microcontroller board. Rather, they can manage the resources of the Constrained Application Protocol servers through an accessible and transparent Web user interface.", "This paper proposes and evaluates the implementation of a self-localization system intended for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Accurate localization is necessary for UAVs for efficient stabilization, navigation and collision avoidance. Conventionally, this requirement is fulfilled using external hardware infrastructure, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or camera-based motion capture system (VICON-like [37]). These approaches are, however, not applicable in environments where deployment of cumbersome motion capture equipment is not feasible, as well as in GNSS-denied environments. Systems based on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) require heavy and expensive onboard equipment and high amounts of data transmissions for sharing maps between UAVs. Availability of a system without these drawbacks is crucial for deployment of tight formations of multiple fully autonomous micro UAVs for both outdoor and indoor missions. The project was inspired by the often used sensor PX4FLOW Smart Camera [12]. The aim was to develop a similar sensor, but without the multiple drawbacks observed in its use, as well as to make the operation of it more transparent and to make it independent of a specific hardware. Our proposed solution requires only a lightweight camera and a single-point range sensor. It is based on optical flow estimation from consecutive images obtained from downward-facing camera, coupled with a specialized RANSAC-inspired post-processing method that takes into account flight dynamics. This filtering makes it more robust against imperfect lighting, homogenous ground patches, random close objects and spurious errors. These features make this approach suitable even for coordinated flights through demanding forest-like environment. The system is designed mainly for horizontal velocity estimation, but specialized modifications were also made for vertical speed and yaw rotation rate estimation. These methods were tested in a simulator and subsequently in real world conditions. The tests showed, that the sensor is suitably reliable and accurate to be usable in practice.", "Pocket-drones are inherently safe for flight near humans, and their small size allows maneuvering through narrow indoor environments. However, achieving autonomous flight of pocket-drones is challenging because of strict on-board hardware limitations. Further challenges arise when multiple pocket-drones operate as a team and need to coordinate their movements. This paper presents a set-up that can achieve autonomous flight in an indoor environment with avoidance of both static obstacles and other pocket-drones. The pocket drones use only on-board sensing and processing implemented on a STM32F4 microprocessor (168MHz). Experiments were conducted with two 40g pocket-drones flying autonomously in a real-world office while avoiding walls, obstacles, and each-other.", "The OCSDNet Manifesto is a result of one year of participatory consultations and debates amongst members of the 'Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network' (OCSDNet), a network of 12 research-practitioner teams from Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Through research projects grounded in diverse regions and disciplines, OCSDNet members explore the scope of Open Science as a transformative tool for development thinking and practice and offer the 'Open and Collaborative Science Manifesto' as a foundation upon which to reclaim the mainstream narrative about what Open Science means and how it can realise a more inclusive science in development. This paper describes the mechanisms used for collaboration and consensus building, and explores the ways in which the process of building this document serves as a case study for the opportunities and limitations of integrating collaboration, opportunities for participation and openness into research activities.", "Effective formation and coverage control of mobile robots require a reliable and powerful wireless communication infrastructure for exchanging information among themselves. Standard Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) based Wi-Fi networking is a popular wireless communication method which allows rapid development of high bandwidth communication interface for multi-robot systems. A large number of educational and experimental mobile robots have been developed with ATmega microcontrollers for their ease of programming. However, there is no off the shelf Wi-Fi communication module available which can directly interface with the standard ATmega microcontrollers. This paper gives a detailed technical account of how a versatile Wi-Fi communication module can be developed for standard ATmega microcontrollers so that it can be utilized for establishing a powerful communication among a group of mobile robots. The circuit development and power supply issues have been elaborated. The effectiveness of the communication module developed has been established by successful experimentation of ATmega microcontroller based autonomous mobile robots for cooperative navigation.", "We investigate tethered flight of a small quadrotor robot in the context of creating stippled prints. At a low level, we use motion capture to measure the position of the robot and the canvas, and a robust control algorithm to command the robot to fly to different stipple positions to make contact with the canvas using an ink soaked sponge. With the objective of fully autonomous flight, we power our quadrotor using a wired tether. We compensate for the tether in our control of the robot by assuming a static catenary curve of fixed length between the robot and the power source, and model the forces and torques produced. We evaluate accuracy of hovering and flight on simple paths, and compare the results to untethered flight.", "In this paper, we present a tiny networked mobile platform, termed Tiny-Web-Thing (T-Wing), which allows the sharing of data-intensive content among objects in cyber physical systems. The object includes mobile platforms like a smartphone, and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms for Human-to-Human (H2H), Human-to-Machine (H2M), Machine-to-Human (M2H), and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. T-Wing makes it possible to host rich web content directly on their objects, which nearby objects can access instantaneously. Using a new mechanism that allows the Wi-Fi interface of the object to be turned on purely on-demand, T-Wing achieves very high energy efficiency. We have implemented T-Wing on an embedded board, and present evaluation results from our testbed. From the evaluation result of T-Wing, we compare our system against alternative approaches to implement this functionality using only the cellular or Wi-Fi (but not both), and show that in typical usage, T-Wing consumes less than 15 x the energy and is faster by an order of magnitude.", "The widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has enabled the possibility to open a research project to the contributions of non-professional actors (amateurs, students or sometimes even experts without a formal job-title) in the so called \"open/citizen science\". Previous studies have shown as also non-professional actors have the potential to provide a valuable contribution also to complex research projects if the environment in which they are engaged is carefully designed. Theoretical frameworks and operative guidelines for developing public engagement activities for citizen science are still evolving and are not exhaustively defined. While designing the public engagement activities for a robotics research project, HeritageBot (HB), we looked for empirical guidelines and theoretical framework that could support our work. The lack of a structured and comprehensive answer to our research needs has been the initial trigger for this article. This paper explores the process of developing collaborative initiatives involving external non-professional actors in a set of HB's scientific research tasks through a set of public engagement activities. First, we will explore the theoretical framework and the selected methodologies for designing citizen-science strategies. Second, we will describe, through empirical episodes, the action research approach that we followed to develop HB's public engagement strategy. Finally, we will introduce the progresses in defining an experimental methodology, instrumental to the validation of the defined strategy.", "This paper presents an 8-channel neural stimulator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for biphasic stimulation of the visual cortex, fabricated in a 0.35 mu m AMS HV process. Each channel is composed of a standard SPI interface, an 8-bit current digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and 120V compliant HV output stage. Thus, it is possible to deliver to the tissue arbitrary current waveforms with amplitudes up to +/- 8.192mA with 32 mu A steps. The measured maximum differential nonlinearity (DNL) of the current output does not exceed 1.1 LSB. The on-board current reference provides the output current of 16 mu A with a very low temperature variation. The maximum anodic and cathodic current mismatch after calibration is 25 mu A. The measured interpulse leakage current does not exceed 60 pA. The ASIC was also tested with the electrode-tissue model, which describes the PEDOT electrodes of 560 mu m diameter in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The measurement results approve the possibility to stimulate with arbitrary current amplitudes with frequencies up to 1.5 kHz.", "A real-time irrigation scheduling system (ISS) for greenhouses has been developed in compliance with the ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 standard. The developed system is capable of displaying greenhouse and irrigation scheduling parameters. Irrigation can wirelessly be automated by the sensor node by activating irrigation based on sensor values and predefined irrigation parameters. A low power sensor node was developed to record greenhouse conditions, measuring soil moisture, light, CO2, temperature, and humidity. The sensor node wirelessly sends all measured data to a graphical user interface application running on a server. All data received by the GUI is stored within a MySQL database for history and statistical purposes. An irrigation module was also designed, enabling the system to wirelessly actuate irrigation when required. Irrigation can either be manually operated through the GUI, or automated through the sensor node based on current greenhouse conditions. The system's wireless communication is implemented using ZigBee modules and the modules have been configured with Digi-Mesh firmware, enabling mesh network functionality on all wireless devices. The ISS is low cost and energy efficient.", "Arduino has become one of the most popular platforms for building electronic projects, especially among novices. In the last years countless tools, environments, and programming languages have been developed to support Arduino. One of these is Physical Etoys, a visual programming platform for robots developed by the authors. Physical Etoys supports compiling programs into the arduino. For this to work, a Smalltalk to C++ translator has been built. Although it has been very useful, this translator has brought a new set of issues. In this paper we will discuss some of these problems and how we decided to overcome them by developing a simple virtual machine that will be used as the base for the new Physical Etoys.", "This paper proposes a virtualized network function orchestration system based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV), one of the main technologies in 5G mobile networks. This system should provide connectivity between network devices and be able to create flexible network function and distribution. This system focuses more on access networks. By experimenting with various scenarios of user service established and activated in a network, we examine whether rapid adoption of new service is possible and whether network resources can be managed efficiently. The proposed method is based on Bluetooth transfer technology and mesh networking to provide automatic connections between network machines and on a Docker flat form, which is a container virtualization technology for setting and managing key functions. Additionally, the system includes a clustering and recovery measure regarding network function based on the Docker platform. We will briefly introduce the QR code perceived service as a user service to examine the proposal and based on this given service, we evaluate the function of the proposal and present analysis. Through the proposed approach, container relocation has been implemented according to a network device's CPU usage and we confirm successful service through function evaluation on a real test bed. We estimate QR code recognition speed as the amount of network equipment is gradually increased, improving user service and confirm that the speed of recognition is increased as the assigned number of network devices is increased by the user service.", "Software for computer animation is generally characterized by a steep learning curve, due to the entanglement of both sophisticated techniques and interaction methods required to control 3D geometries. This paper proposes a tool designed to support computer animation production processes by leveraging the affordances offered by articulated tangible user interfaces and motion capture retargeting solutions. To this aim, orientations of an instrumented prop are recorded together with animator's motion in the 3D space and used to quickly pose characters in the virtual environment. High-level functionalities of the animation software are made accessible via a speech interface, thus letting the user control the animation pipeline via voice commends while focusing on his or her hands and body motion. The proposed solution exploits both off-the-shelf hardware components (like the Lego Mindstorms EV3 bricks and the Microsoft Kinect, used for building the tangible device and tracking animator's skeleton) and free open-source software (like the Blender animation tool), thus representing an interesting solution also for beginners approaching the world of digital animation for the first time. Experimental results in different usage scenarios show the benefits offered by the designed interaction strategy with respect to a mouse & keyboard-based interface both for expert and non-expert users.", "In this article, the design and implementation of an innovative photovoltaic system prototype intelligent control lighting based on Arduino and ZigBee described. The lighting system is connected to a power generation system composed of isolated photovoltaic cells. The lighting control system is subject to a vehicle detection permitting variation of the light intensity when vehicles circulating on the highway. The variation of the light intensity and control of the lighting system is managed through an Arduino microcontroller which in turn transmits information wirelessly to other luminaires distributed along the highway. Thus, it is expected that the lighting system present a significant savings in energy consumption by making use of innovative technologies.", "One of the greatest challenges for fixed-wing unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) is safe landing. Hereafter, an on-ground deployed visual approach is developed in this paper. This approach is definitely suitable for landing within the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environments. As for applications, the deployed guidance system makes full use of the ground computing resource and feedbacks the aircraft's real-time localization to its on-board autopilot. Under such circumstances, a separate long baseline stereo architecture is proposed to possess an extendable baseline and wide-angle field of view (FOV) against the traditional fixed baseline schemes. Furthermore, accuracy evaluation of the new type of architecture is conducted by theoretical modeling and computational analysis. Dataset-driven experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed approach.", "With rapid advancements in information and communication technology, open collaboration has become easier, thereby allowing people to participate through internet platform. Open source software is one of the representative examples of open collaboration. In this research, we examine the antecedents of innovation performance for open source software development organizations on Github (www.github.com), which is a leading web service for the open collaborations of developers. From the perspective of resource allocation, this study investigates effective governance strategies to allocate developers to multiple projects within an organization. Overall, we find that the organization with high performance have a small number of developers to participate in most projects and most developers to participate in a small number of projects.", "This research project explores to what extent the utilization of open-source 3D printers and 3D design software could serve as means of learning and communication. The principles of non-formal education aligned with the concept of constructionism are used to create an experimental educational scenario focused on geocultural tourism for persons with visual impairments. This paper documents our experience and presents our findings- from a 25-day long project, which took place in Zagori, northwestern Greece. 11 high school students from Portugal designed and manufactured natural and cultural heritage artifacts carrying messages in the Braille language. The objects were then handed to people with visual impairments with a twofold aim. First, to enable the communication among persons with and without visual impairments; and, second, to empower students to participate in training projects through open educational procedures. We conclude that open educational practices can boost students' active engagement in educational processes. Finally, 3D printing encourages a meaningful communication among people with and without visual impairments via the tangible exploration of geocultural components. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A vision-inertia based navigation algorithm is proposed which only uses the information of the grid intersection points and inertial measurement unit. First, the grid lines are detected by merging pixels with adjacent location and approximate intensity. Characteristic parameters of the lines are obtained by solving a least square problem. Then, the locations of the intersection points are calculated using these characteristic parameters. Secondly, the intersection points are matched with the corresponding points located in the real environment by solving a joint optimization problem, meanwhile the optimal homography matrix is obtained. Thirdly, the navigation information is estimated by an Extended Kalman Filter which uses the pose recovered from the homography matrix as measurements. Finally, the experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed navigation method.", "The novelty of the Internet of Things (IoT) as a trend has not given society sufficient time to establish a clear view of what IoT is and how it operates. As such, people are likely to be unaware of the privacy implications, thus creating a gap between the belief of what a device does and its actual behaviour. The responses collected in our online survey indicate that participants tend to see IoT as computer -like devices, rather than appliances, though there are some important misconceptions about the way these devices function. We also find that privacy is a primary concern when it comes to IoT adoption. Nevertheless, participants have a propensity to keep using IoT devices even after they find out that the device abuses their trust. Finally, we provide recommendations to IoT vendors, to make their products more transparent in terms of privacy.", "Information is managed avoiding overload in Fab Labs, digital manufacturing environments.

In the Brighton trial, three-quarters of those who were loaned an e-bike used them at least once a week. Across the sample as a whole, average usage was in the order of 1520 miles per week, and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20%. At the end of the trial, 38% participants expected to cycle more in the future, and at least 70% said that they would like to have an e-bike available for use in the future, and would cycle more if this was the case. This is consistent with the results of the European literature which shows that when e-bikes are made available, they get used; that a proportion of e-bike trips typically substitutes for car use; and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e-bike use, or cycling more generally.

Open design connects the generation and transmission of digital content to actual material production and physical embodiment - the making of tangible things. Open design therefore represents an opening-up of the means of production of our material culture - how we make things. This chapter considers products in the open design context more broadly, in relation to considerations of sustainability and practices of social and sustainable design. It takes a broad view of the term 'product'. Object-based designing is not necessarily the optimal way of addressing the 'wicked' problems we face as manifestations of the inherent unsustainability of our existing systems of production and consumption, and our current lifestyles and value systems. The open design context can be seen to extend beyond the current model of the creation of products via an expanded circle of participation, to include the expanded field of design represented by service design and social innovation. This chapter, therefore, considers not simply products in the open design context (in the form of new modes of doing product design) but also products of the open design context. It uses an expanded idea of product which includes any form of designed outcome, physical or non-physical, and an expanded idea of openness which goes beyond the internet- and digitally-enabled production of physical objects.", "Dual probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensors are economical solutions for soil moisture measurements. However, in agriculture fields the temperature significantly changes from time to time during 24 h, which affects response of the soil moisture sensor. This paper, analyzes and models the error produced in the response of the DPHP sensors due to variation of the soil temperature. For this purpose, first effect of the soil temperature on the response of the sensor is studied using eight different soil samples. Accordingly, the existing soil moisture model, used for DPHP devices, is modified and used for the temperature compensation. A low power DPHP sensor comprising one heater probe and one temperature sensor probe, placed 0.003 m apart, is fabricated. A low power, automated system, dissipating average power of 30 mW, is also developed for the field measurements to validate the proposed model. The developed system is deployed in the field and soil moisture is measured for 38 h at every 1 h interval.

GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors, nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important(3) but poorly understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast, glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity(4)) triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain). Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1 inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and/or disassembly of higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of protein kinases.", "The domain of 'robotics' is undergoing a major transformation in dimension as well as scope. Recent advances in various disciplines of technology have revolutionized this domain at an incredible pace far beyond the contemporary state of the art. Highlighting the forecasted population of robots in future and the resulting demand of massive energy consumption, this review addresses the application of renewable energy sources in uninterruptible supply for robots. The study analyzes the extensive field of renewable energy technology and discovers that comparing with traditional sources; green energies like solar, wind and biological have significant potential to drive robots. Listing the world-wide achievements attained by the applications of renewable energy technology for robots, the review finally presents the subject matter in context of Pakistan. It is shown that being rich in renewable energy resources, broad possibilities for robot technologies exist here. With a discussion on challenges to exploit this potential, suggestions are outlined. It is anticipated that wider dissemination of research developments in the integration of these streams will stimulate more exchanges and collaborations among the research community and contribute to further advancements.", "This article contends that technopopulism is a discursive formation that emerges from the convergence of two preexisting discourses: populism and technolibertarianism. Whereas these discourses are historically distinct the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 wave of struggles precipitated the political conditions for their intersection. Such convergence produces both tensions and possibilities. On the one hand, technopopulism engenders a radically participatory model of democracy, which is ultimately anti-institutional as citizens cooperate and engage in sophisticated decision-making without the mediation of professional politicians. On the other hand, the more electorally successful technopopulist parties are led by charismatic leaders who synthesize the positions that emerge from the netroots to mobilize them against the establishment. These two seemingly contradictory aspects precipitate in two variants of technopopulism: a leaderless-technocratic variant, which is derived from the open source mode of governance and from early experiments of the Global Justice Movement in networked self-government; and a leaderist-populist variant, which is more strictly focused on the electoral competition as an intrinsically hegemonic practice. The article concludes with a reflection on the discursive complementarity of these two variants.", "Characterizing dementia is a global challenge in supporting personalized health care. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a promising tool to support the diagnosis and evaluation of abnormalities in the human brain. The EEG sensors record the brain activity directly with excellent time resolution. In this study, EEG sensor with 19 electrodes were used to test the background activities of the brains of five vascular dementia (VaD), 15 stroke-related patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 15 healthy subjects during a working memory (WM) task. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to enhance the recorded EEG signals using a novel technique that combines automatic independent component analysis (AICA) and wavelet transform (WT), that is, the AICA-WT technique; second, it aims to extract and investigate the spectral features that characterize the post-stroke dementia patients compared to the control subjects. The proposed AICA-WT technique is a four-stage approach. In the first stage, the independent components (ICs) were estimated. In the second stage, three-step artifact identification metrics were applied to detect the artifactual components. The components identified as artifacts were marked as critical and denoised through DWT in the third stage. In the fourth stage, the corrected ICs were reconstructed to obtain artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the proposed AICA-WT technique was compared with those of two other techniques based on AICA andWT denoising methods using cross-correlation XCorr and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The AICA-WT technique exhibited the best artifact removal performance. The assumption that there would be a deceleration of EEG dominant frequencies in VaD and MCI patients compared with control subjects was assessed with AICA-WT (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Therefore, this study may provide information on post-stroke dementia particularly VaD and stroke-related MCI patients through spectral analysis of EEG background activities that can help to provide useful diagnostic indexes by using EEG signal processing.", "This paper presents a novel ultrawideband wireless spread spectrum millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel sounder that supports both a wideband sliding correlator mode and a real-time spread spectrum mode, also known as wideband correlation or direct correlation. Both channel sounder modes are capable of absolute propagation delay (time of flight) measurements with up to 1 GHz of radio frequency null-to-null bandwidth, and can measure multipath with a 2-ns time resolution. The sliding correlator configuration facilitates long-distance measurements with angular spread and delay spread for up to 185 dB of maximum measurable path loss. The real-time spread spectrum mode is shown to support short-range, small-scale temporal, and Doppler measurements (minimum snapshot sampling interval of 32.753 aes) with a substantial dynamic fading range of 40 dB for human blockage and dynamic urban scenarios. The channel sounder uses field programmable gate arrays, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, and low-phase-noise rubidium standard references for frequency/time synchronization and absolute time delay measurements. Using propagation theory, several methods are presented here to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the channel sounder, and an improved diffraction model for human blockage, based on the METIS model but now including directional antenna gains, is developed from measurements using the channel sounder. The mmWave channel sounder described here may be used for accurate spatial and temporal ray-tracing calibration, to identify individual multipath components, to measure antenna patterns, for constructing spatial profiles of mmWave channels, and for developing statistical channel impulse response models in time and space.", null, "This article examines whether the arguments put forward by Free Software advocates in the context of computers also apply for robots.
