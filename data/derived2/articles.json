characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are presented, which was mainly constructed from conventional instruments and components. This switched architecture system is similar to commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US$ 50000). The sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers, which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this \"open-hardware\" project, the hardware design and software components are openly available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the MIMO measurement capability. The actual systems built at the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, and Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, are presented, as are some example studies.","5":"In this paper we describe a localization and local communication system which allows situated agents to communicate locally, obtaining at the same time both the range and the bearing of the emitter without the need of any centralized control or any external reference. The system relies on infrared communications with frequency modulation and is composed of two interconnected modules for data and power measurement. Thanks to the open hardware license under which it is released, the research community can easily replicate the system at a low cost and\/or adapt it for applications in sensor networks and in robotics.","11":null,"37":"This article introduces an open wireless architecture (OWA) mobile terminal design, focusing on the open baseband processing platform, to support different existing and future wireless communication standards through multi-dimensional open baseband processing modules with open interface parameters and baseband management systems. The article describes a multilayer, open architecture platform to maximize system flexibility and minimize terminal power consumption, so as to provide an integrated and converged next-generation wireless and mobile communication terminal system. The OWA platform is fully compatible with the computer architecture, with interface-based rather than transmission-specific system architecture, for complete openness and simplicity.","39":"SENORA is an open hardware and software architecture for the cooperative coordination of multiple heterogeneous mobile robots operating in a common environment. It is designed to meet the stringent requirements of modern loosely coupled multirobot architectures, such as flexibility, reliability, and fault tolerance. As such, the proposed architecture enables the robots to cope with the ubiquitous presence of various types of uncertainties in their operating environments. SENORA is a fully autonomous and scalable sensory-based peer-to-peer (P2P) framework. It also offers a real-time inter-robot communication protocol and it is based on the state-of-the-art P2P technology, which is specifically designed to satisfy the requirements of physical sensory data publishing and fusion. This architecture is implemented and evaluated on a team of indoor mobile robots. The test results manifest the architecture's distinguished features and capabilities.","40":"Moving object segmentation plays an important role in a complex object tracking system. This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H\/W) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system.

The RobotCub project aims to develop an embodied robotic child (iCub) with the physical (height 90 cm and mass less than 23 kg) and ultimately cognitive abilities of a 2.5-year-old human child. The iCub will be a freely available open system which can be used by scientists in all cognate disciplines from developmental psychology to epigenetic robotics to enhance understanding of cognitive systems through the study of cognitive development. The iCub will be open both in software, but more importantly in all aspects of the hardware and mechanical design. In this paper the design of the mechanisms and structures forming the basic 'body' of the iCub are described. The papers considers kinematic structures dynamic design criteria, actuator specification and selection, and detailed mechanical and electronic design. The paper concludes with tests of the performance of sample joints, and comparison of these results with the design requirements and simulation projects.","45":"Among the novel flow techniques, multicommutated flow-injection analysis (MCFIA), multi-syringe FIA (MSFIA) and multi-pumping flow systems (MPFSs) should be highlighted. The main disadvantage of these techniques is the availability of hardware and\/or software for systems control. In this article, we present new instrumentation and possible trends for MCFIA, MPFS, MSFIA and the combination of these techniques. We discuss the potential of Autoanalysis software, which does not require the user to have any computer-programming skills to develop analytical methods. Feedback mechanisms in the software allow users to design smart systems that are able to make decisions without human intervention. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, our knowledge of its deployment outside the software industry is very limited. This paper focuses on the open source development of tangible objects, the so-called open design. We propose a generalised definition of open source development. Drawing on 27 exploratory interviews and six comparative case studies selected from a pool of more than 75 projects, we analyse the workings of open design. The analysis reveals that open design is already being implemented in a substantial variety of projects with different organisational and institutional structures.","51":["The research community worldwide has increasingly drawn its attention to the weaknesses of the current Internet. Many proposals are addressing the perceived problems, ranging from new enhanced protocols to fix specific problems up to the most radical proposal to redesign and deploy a fully new Internet. Most of the problems in the current Internet are rooted in the tremendous pace of increase of its use. As a consequence there was little time to address the deficiencies of the Internet from an architectural point of view.","Within FP7, the European Commission has facilitated the creation of European expert groups around the theme FIRE \"Future Internet Research and Experimentation\". FIRE has two related dimensions: on one hand, promoting experimentally-driven long-term, visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future Internet; on the other hand, building a large-scale experimentation facility supporting both medium- and long-term research on networks and services by gradually federating existing and new testbeds for emerging or future Internet technologies. By addressing future challenges for the Internet such as mobility, scalability, security and privacy, this new experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet development. This new initiative is intended to complement the more industrially-driven approaches which are addressed under the FP7 Objective \"The Network of the Future\" within the FP7-ICT Workprogramme 2007-08. FIRE is focused on exploring new and radically better technological solutions for the future Internet, while preserving the \"good\" aspects of the current Internet, in terms of openness, freedom of expression and ubiquitous access. The FIRE activities are being launched in the 2nd ICT call, which closes in October 2007, under the FP7-ICT Objective 1.6 \"New Paradigms and Experimental Facilities\" (budget is an element of 40m). Projects are envisaged to start in early 2008."],"53":null,"73":"Open source software lets users study, modify and redistribute the source code. It has shown a surprisingly robust level of activity and importance in the computing world despite extreme dominance of Microsoft operating and office software in the workstation marketplace and the strength of commercial players in the server and industrial sectors. Possible evolutionary drivers are presented for open source software for the next decade, looking at the nature as well as level of use, with preliminary discussion of how the open source approach might be applied to other idea-based technologies, including foresight methods.

We highlight how many aspects of open source software appear initially puzzling to an economist. As we have acknowledged, our ability to answer confidently many of the issues raised here questions is likely to increase as the open source movement itself grows and evolves. At the same time, it is heartening to us how much of open source activities can be understood within existing economic frameworks, despite the presence of claims to the contrary. The labor and industrial organization literatures provide lenses through which the structure of open source projects, the role of contributors, and the movement's ongoing evolution can be viewed.","77":"This paper presents a new haptic device based on a parallel structure that can be used as a master interface in a teleoperation or haptic control architecture. The basic idea of a haptic device is to serve force and\/or position reflection to the operator; at the same time that is being used by the human operator to input the required commands. The original mechanical Structure of the presented system implies important advantages over other existing devices. The mechanism is a modification of the 6-d.o.f. Gough platform where the linear actuators have been replaced by cable-driven pantographs. Avoiding the use of reduction gears by means of cable transmission allows a wide sensing bandwidth. Some experimental indices comparing the performance of the presented device are presented. The paper shows the geometrical model and the kinematic analysis used oil the control algorithms of this interface. The hardware and software architectures used on the system, and the control schemes implemented on a multi-axis board, are detailed. This setup provides in open control architecture that allows the implementation and experimentation of several bilateral control schemes. The integration of the haptic device in a teleoperation simulator is shown. This simulator includes Virtual robotic slaves and its dynamic interaction with the Virtual environment. Finally, the results obtained in the virtual objects manipulation experiments are shown. A classical force-position bilateral control scheme was used for these experiments.","91":"The paper describes system synthesis and architecture of a multilayered distributed SCADA\/HMI system. The system is used for monitoring and control of refinery terminals for truck loading and oil products pipeline shipping. Network-centered, distributed PLC system with SCADA functions and several levels of fieldbuses, interconnected with the HMI part of the system is described first. Following is a brief description of the software tools used in the system design. Configuration and PLC controllers programming, data server configuration, operator panels design and way of managing the control system using a standard Web browser, e.g. Internet Explorer, are addressed. After examining the way specific customization is done, the paper focuses on establishing the link with icons on graphic panels that integrates all three levels of process control from Operator's panels.

However, software routers suffer from many limitations Of the PC architecture, including, among others, limited bus and central processing unit (CPU) bandwidth high memory access latency, limited scalability in terms of number of network interface cards, and lack of resilience mechanisms. Multistage PC-based architectures can be an interesting alternative since they permit us to i) increase the performance of singlesoftware routers, ii) scale router size, iii) distribute packet-manipulation and control functionality, iv) recover from single-component failures, and v) incrementally upgrade router performance. We propose a specific multistage architecture, exploiting PC-based routers as switching elements, to build a high-speed, largesize, scalable, and reliable software router. A small-scale prototype of the multistage router is currently up and running in our labs, and performance evaluation is un er way.","103":"Kittyhawk represents our vision for a Web-scale computational resource that can accommodate a significant fraction of the world's computation needs and enable various parties to compete and cooperate in the provisioning of services on a consolidated platform. In this paper, we explain both the vision and the system architecture that supports it. We demonstrate these ideas by way of a prototype implementation that uses the IBM Blue Gene (R)\/P platform. In the Kittyhawk prototype, we define a set of basic services that enable the allocation and interconnection of computing resources. By using examples, we show how higher layers of services can be built by using our basic services and standard open-source software.","117":"In this paper, we have shown a major element occupying the large portion of software communications architecture (SCA)-based software defined radio (SDR) handheld embedded system and an important feature for implementing a high speed broadband radio to an SCA waveform through a couple of experiments. First, this paper identifies the main items possessing the large portion of SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system by the experiment on the target platform which is similar to a commercial mobile handheld system. Both the world interoperabillity for microwave access (WiMAX) and high speed downlink packet access (HS-DPA) waveform software packages are used as an SCA waveform application. This paper also presents the results of the relative binary size distribution of SCA software resources for looking for the major elements making an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system heavier. As a result, when focusing on the relative weight portion of SCA core framework (CF), the SCA CF takes 16% up and others have 84% out of the whole binary size distribution of SCA software resources. The results of the experiment give us notice that the weight portion of SCA CF is minor and compatible with the overall software binary size needs of an SCA-based SDR handheld embedded system, on the other hand, the practical problem on the lightweight is in a common object request broker architecture (CORBA) and extensible markup language (XML) parser resources. Second, this paper describes an important feature for implementing a high speed broadband radio to an SCA waveform and presents the performance evaluation results of the SCA port communication on both power PC (PPC) 405 and x86 processor platforms. The PPC 405 platform, which is similar to a commercial mobile handset, takes the value of average round trip time (RTT) with a maximum of thirty six millisecond. The x86 platform, however, which is analogous to a server platform, maintains stable micro-second resolution. From our experiments, we observe that rapid SCA port communication, sufficiently less than the frame length of high-speed broadband radios, should be provided for serving those radio services in a commercial handheld system based on the SCA.","124":"The video capture, processing, and communication in wireless video sensor networks critically depend on the resources of the nodes forming the sensor networks. We provide a survey of wireless video sensor node platforms (WVSNPs). From a comprehensive literature review, we first select the node architectures that meet basic requirements for a WVSNP. We then introduce a classification of WVSNPs into general purpose architectures, heavily coupled architectures, and externally dependent architectures. We thoroughly survey and contrast the existing WVSNPs within this classification framework. Based on the insights from our survey we develop a novel Flexi-WVSNP design. The Flexi-WVSNP design includes dual-radio communication, a middleware for sensor operation and communication control, as well as a cohesive hardware and software design.","125":["Exploration of remote environments, once the domain of intrepid adventurers, can now be conducted in relative safety using unmanned vehicles. This article describes the joint University of Michigan (UMich) and Michigan Tech Research Institute's project to design and to build a new autonomous surface vessel (ASV) for use in research, education, and resource management as well as in the commercial sector.","Originally designed to assist with bathymetric surveys in the wilderness of northern Alaska, the BathyBoat has become a test-bed plafform for new research in collaborative heterogeneous underwater robotic search and survey missions in ports, harbors, lakes, and rivers.

A custom-made electrical stimulator was integrated via inserting two carbon rod electrodes into a perfusion bioreactor, housing multiple neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac cell constructs between two 96% open-pore-area fixing nets. The stimulator produced adjustable stimulation waveform (i.e., duty cycle, number of stimulating channels, maximum stimulation amplitude, etc.), specially designed for cardiac cell stimulation. The cell constructs were subjected to a homogenous fluid flow regime and electrical stimulation under conditions optimal for cell excitation. The stimulation threshold in the bioreactor was set by first determining its value in a Petri dish under a microscope, and then matching the current density in the two cultivation systems by constructing electric field models. The models were built by Comsol Multiphysics software using the exact three-dimensional geometry of the two cultivation systems. These models illustrate, for the first time, the local electric conditions required for cardiomyocyte field excitation and they confirmed the uniformity of the electrical field around the cell constructs. Bioreactor cultivation for only 4 days under perfusion and continuous electrical stimulus (74.4 mA\/cm(2), 2 ms, bipolar, 1 Hz) promoted cell elongation and striation in the cell constructs and enhanced the expression level of Connexin-43, the gap junction protein responsible for cell-cell coupling. These results thus confirm the validity of the electrical field model in predicting the optimal electrical stimulation in a rather complex cultivation system, a perfusion bioreactor.","130":["Despite its huge success and increasing incorporation in complex, industrial-strength applications, open source software, by the very nature of its open, unconventional, distributed development model, is hard to assess and certify in an effective, sound and independent way. This makes its use and integration within safety or security-critical systems, a risk. And, simultaneously an opportunity and a challenge for rigourous, mathematically based, methods which aim at pushing software analysis and development to the level of a mature engineering discipline.","This paper discusses such a challenge and proposes a number of ways in which open source development may benefit from the whole patrimony of formal methods."],"133":"Embedded controllers are increasingly popular in industrial applications since designing flexible control modules over them can rapidly provide a finished product with a low manufacturing cost. Hence, rapid controller prototyping for embedded controller has been presented to resolve obstacles to developing controllers quickly. However, most proposed methods are prohibitively expensive and are restricted in the choice of software and hardware, thus, making them infeasible for engineering applications with the considerations of performance and cost. To solve the aforementioned problems, this study adopts MATLAB\/Simulink with Real-Time Workshop as an effective means of producing a rapid controller development platform (RCDP), in which the controller model is built by the graphical drive modules, and is verified in Simulink, and the executable code correspondent to the controller model is then automatically generated and transferred to the target system for testing and verification. Experimental results indicate that the automatic generated code for third order controller with 1 ms sampling rate and actual position tracking in the X-Y table motion control can typically achieve the desired performance. Thus the proposed RCDP can effectively and practically save the development time of controller designs, particularly in the experimental course related to control theory in the education.","137":"The benefits of project-based learning environments are well documented; however, setting up and maintaining these environments can be challenging due to the high cost and expertise associated with these platforms. To alleviate some of these roadblocks, the existing eBlock platform which is composed of fixed function building blocks targeted to enable nonexperts users to easily build a variety of interactive electronic systems is expanded to incorporate newly defined integer-based building blocks to enable a wider range of project possibilities for middle school STEM projects. We discuss various interface possibilities, including initial usability experiments, and summarize our overall experiences and observations in working with local middles school students utilizing the eBlock platform.","140":"In this article we describe the re-embodiment of biological aggregation behavior of honeybees in Jasmine micro-robots. The observed insect behavior, in the context of the insect's sensor-actor system, is formalized as behavioral and motion-sensing meta-models. These meta-models are transformed into a sensor-actor system of micro-robots by means of a sensors virtualization technique. This allows us to keep the efficiency and scalability of the bio-inspired approach. We also demonstrate the systematic character of this re-embodiment procedure on collective aggregation in a real robotic swarm.","143":"Mechanical load and chemical factors as stimuli for the different pattern of the extracellular matrix (ECM) could be responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Since fibroblasts can both synthesize and degrade ECM, ventricular fibroblasts from adult rat hearts underwent cyclical mechanical stretch (CMS; 0.33 Hz) by three different elongations ( 3%,6%, 9%) and four different serum concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 5%, 10%) within 24 h. Expression of collagen I and III, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP- 2), tissue inhibitor of MMP- 2 (TIMP-2), and colligin were analyzed by RNase protection assay. In the absence of serum, 9% CMS increased the mRNA of collagen I by 1.70- fold and collagen III by 1.64-fold. This increase was prevented by the inhibition either of PKC or of tyrosine kinase but not of PKA. Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase itself reduced the expression of collagen I and collagen III mRNA. The mRNA of MMP- 2, TIMP-2, and colligin showed the same tendency by stretch. Combined with 10% serum, 6% CMS reduced the mRNA of collagen I (0.62-fold) and collagen III ( 0.79fold). Inhibition of PKC or tyrosine kinase, but not of PKA, prevented the reduction of collagen I and collagen III mRNA in 10% serum. The results show that the response of fibroblasts to CMS depends on the serum concentration. At least two signaling pathways are involved in the stretch-induced ECM regulation. Myocardial fibrosis due to ECM remodeling contributes to the dysfunction of the failing heart, which might be attributed to changes in hemodynamic loading.","147":"With the ever-increasing deployment and usage of gigabit networks, traditional networks intrusion detection\/prevention systems (IDSs\/IPSs) have not scaled accordingly. More recently, researchers have been looking at hardware-based solutions that use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to assist network IDSs\/IPSs, and some proposed systems have been developed that can be scaled to achieve a high speed over 10 Gbps. However, these solutions have certain drawbacks. In this paper, we present a uniform high-speed traffic collection platform for intrusion detection\/prevention based on sampling on FPGAs, called HSTCP. The methodology is when the proposed platform is unable to capture the whole network traffic, it will initiate elephant flow sampling rather than simple packets drop. Meanwhile, the sampling rate is adaptive to the traffic load changes in the elephant flow. The noteworthy features of HSTCP include the following: (a) it takes the self-similarity of network traffic into account with complete mice flows capture and elephant flow sampling; (b) it employs adaptive elephant flow sampling to retain inherent characteristics of network traffic; and (c) it provides a flexible and scalable platform for network IDSs\/IPSs faced to the challenge of the future high-speed network.","148":["A set-up for the calibration of a heterodyne laser-vibrometer is described. By a distinctive optical set-up it is possible to use the laser of the device under test as the single source for the calibration device.

A simple and effective experiment to show how the resolution limit of an optical system is diffraction-limited is reported.","155":"The paper addresses the potential benefits of using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as opposed to a traditional processor for music synthesis. The benefits result from the use of a cellular design, with each cell performing identical operations on its own state and the states of its neighbours. This gives advantages of design simplicity through inherent parallelism. A cellular model which has previously been used for music synthesis is the mass spring paradigm, and this model is implemented on an FPGA. On a sequential processor, the clock speed requirements of this model increase as N-2 (where N is the number of cells), whereas the clock speed requirement increases as Non an FPGA (if the cells can be made small enough that available area on the chip is not a constraint). To make the cells small enough, a bit-serial design was used. This work was performed to advocate the FPGA as a stand-alone live performance music synthesis platform, which has the potential to be reconfigured for example in performance, between synthesis techniques as different sound patches are selected. The paper considers in particular the mass-spring model, because it demonstrates the type of music synthesis technique for which FPGAs provide the greatest potential benefit. The capability to reconfigure combined with the high performance that can be achieved using cellular design suggests that the FPGA is an ideal platform for a live performance hardware music synthesiser, combining the flexibility of software with the speed of a custom ASIC.","158":"A scalable hardware\/software hybrid module called Ubidule- endowed with bio-inspired ontogenetic and epigenetic features is configured to run a neural networks simulation with developmental and evolvable capabilities. We simulated the activity of hierarchically organized spiking neural networks characterized by an initial developmental phase featuring cell death followed by spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity in presence of background noise. An upstream 'sensory' network received a spatiotemporally organized external input and downstream networks were activated only via the upstream network. Precise firing sequences, formed by recurrent patterns of spikes intervals above chance levels, were observed in all recording conditions, thus suggesting the build-up of a connectivity able to sustain temporal information processing. The activity of a Ubinet -a network of Ubidules- is analyzed by means of virtual electrodes that recorded neural signals similar to EEG. The analysis of these signals was compared with a small set of human recordings and revealed common patterns of shift in quadratic phase coupling. The results suggest some interpretations of changes and plasticity of functional interactions between cortical areas driven by external stimuli and by learning\/cognitive paradigms.","161":"The biomechanical environment to which cells are exposed is important to their normal growth, development, interaction, and function. Accordingly, there has been much interest in studying the role of biomechanical forces in cell biology and pathophysiology. This has led to the introduction and even commercialization of many experimental devices. Many of the early devices were limited by the heterogeneity of deformation of cells cultivated in different locations of the culture plate membranes and were also attached with complicated technical\/electronic efforts resulting in a restriction of the reproducibility of these devices. The objective of this study was to design and build a simple device to allow the application of dose-dependent homogeneous equibiaxial static stretch to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes to investigate biological and biomedical questions. In addition, cultured neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes were stretched with the proposed device with different strain gradients. For the first time with this study we could demonstrate that stretch up to 21% caused dose-dependent changes in biological markers such as the calcineurin activity, modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein-1, voltage-gated potassium channel isoform 4.2, and voltage-gated K+ channel-interacting proteins-2 gene expression and transient outward potassium current densities but not the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. With both markers mentioned last, dose-dependent stretch alterations could only be achieved with stretch up to 13%. The simple and low-cost device presented here might be applied to a wide range of experimental settings in different fields of research.","164":"Information theoretic limits for random key generation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems exhibiting a reciprocal channel response are investigated experimentally with a new three-node MIMO measurement campaign. As background, simple expressions are presented for the number of available key bits, as well as the number of bits that are secure from a close eavesdropper. Two methods for generating secret keys are analyzed in the context of MIMO channels and their mismatch rate and efficiency are derived. A new wideband indoor MIMO measurement campaign in the 2.51- to 2.59-GHz band is presented, whose purpose is to study the number of available key bits in both line-of-sight and nonline-of-sight environments. Application of the key generation methods to measured propagation channels indicates key generation rates that can be obtained in practice for four-element arrays.","165":"Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.","166":"This paper describes a compact analog computer and proposes its use in electronic engineering teaching laboratories to develop student understanding of applications in analog electronics, electronic components, engineering mathematics, control engineering, safe laboratory and workshop practices, circuit construction, testing, and maintenance.

In practice, however, the rights afforded to patent holders are highly uncertain. Under patent law, a patent is no guarantee of exclusion but more precisely a legal right to try to exclude. Since only 0.1% of all patents are litigated to trial, and since nearly half of fully litigated patents are declared invalid, this distinction is critical to understanding the economic impact of patents. The growing recognition among economists and legal scholars that patents are probabilistic property rights has significant implications for our understanding of patents in four important areas: (1) reform of the system by which patents are granted; (2) the legal treatment of patents in litigation; (3) the incentives of patent holders and alleged infringers to settle their disputes through licensing or cross-licensing agreements rather than litigate them to completion; and (4) the antitrust limits on agreements between rivals that settle actual or threatened patent litigation.","171":"Both linear and nonlinear transmit precoding strategies based on accurate channel state information (CSI) can significantly increase available throughput in a multiuser wireless system. With propagation delay, infrequent channel updates, lag due to network layer overhead, and time-varying node position or environment characteristics, channel knowledge becomes outdated and CSI-based transmission schemes can experience severe performance degradation. This paper studies the performance of precoding techniques for the multiuser broadcast channel with outdated CSI at the transmitter. Traditional channel models as well as channel realizations measured by a wideband channel sounder are used in the analysis. With measured data from an outdoor urban environment, it is further shown the existence of stable subspaces upon which transmission is possible without any instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. Such transmissions allow for consistent performance curves at the cost of initial suboptimality compared to CSI-based schemes. Copyright (c) 2008.","175":"This work explores the performance of a multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel where both the transmitter and receivers have outdated channel knowledge due to node motion or other time-variations in the communication channel. A performance analysis based on measured channel responses reveals significant throughput degradation for optimal linear and nonlinear precoding strategies unless the channel state information (CSI) is frequently fed back to the transmitter. The paper then develops a linear beamforming precoding strategy based on channel distribution information in the form of a full spatial correlation matrix for each user. This algorithm is shown to provide highly stable communication, with a throughput that is higher than that for optimal precoders operating on outdated CSI, in a time-variant environment, indicating that this approach can operate with significantly reduced feedback frequency. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the use of the well-known Kronecker and Weichselberger models to parameterize the full correlation matrix to enable further reduction in the amount of feedback data required for implementation of the new beamforming technique.","176":"The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.","177":"In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low cost.

This work implements a low-cost teleoperated system to control a humanoid robot, as a first step for further development and study of human motion and walking. A human suit is built, consisting of 8 sensors, 6 resistive linear potentiometers on the lower extremities and 2 digital accelerometers for the arms. The goal is to replicate the suit movements in a small humanoid robot. The data from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted via two ZigBee RF configurable modules installed on each device: the robot and the suit. Replicating the suit movements requires a robot stability control module to prevent falling down while executing different actions involving knees flexion. This is carried out via a feedback control system with an accelerometer placed on the robot's back. The measurement from this sensor is filtered using Kalman. In addition, a two input fuzzy algorithm controlling five servo motors regulates the robot balance.

For five years, this was the most affordable method for connecting computers. The development of this technology was guided by the idea that it should be controlled by its users. With reference to this experiment, it is argued that a shared ethical and\/or political vision can contribute to the establishment of norms within user communities encouraging their members to share information with each other. Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question. Particular focus is placed on the tension between, on one hand, the norms and ethical-political motives of the user community, and, on the other hand, the needs satisfied through product development, both stemming from the same innovation process.","212":"Because battery-powered nodes are required in wireless sensor networks and energy consumption represents an important design consideration, alternate energy sources are needed to provide more effective and optimal function.

A careful study relying on nonstationary statistical modeling and data mining allows us to first model the time evolution of the dynamics of movements with Velo'v, that is mostly cyclostationary over the week with nonstationary evolutions over larger time-scales, and second to disentangle the spatial patterns to understand and visualize the flows of Velo'v bicycles in the city. This study gives insights on the social behaviors of the users of this intermodal transportation system, the objective being to help in designing and planning policy in urban transportation.","220":"Over the last five decades, progress in neural recording techniques has allowed the number of simultaneously recorded neurons to double approximately every 7 years, mimicking Moore's law. Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.","221":"Dual sideband (2SB) receivers are well suited for the spectral observation of complex astronomical signals over a wide frequency range. They are extensively used in radio astronomy, their main advantages being to avoid spectral confusion and to diminish effective system temperature by a factor 2 with respect to double sideband (DSB) receivers. Using available millimeter-wave analog technology, wideband 2SB receivers generally obtain sideband rejection ratios (SRR) of 10-15 dB, insufficient for a number of astronomical applications. We report here the design and implementation of an FPGA-based sideband separating FFT spectrometer. A 4 GHz analog front end was built to test the design and measure sideband rejection. The setup uses a 2SB front end architecture, except that the mixer outputs are directly digitized before the IF hybrid, using two 8 bit ADCs sampling at 1 GSPS. The IF hybrid is implemented on the FPGA together with a set of calibration vectors that, properly chosen, compensate for the analog front end amplitude and phase imbalances. The calibrated receiver exhibits a sideband rejection ratio in excess of 40 dB for the entire 2 GHz RF bandwidth.","223":"We are entering a new era in our ability to modify and edit the genomes of model organisms. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) opened the door to the first custom nuclease-targeted genome engineering in the late 1990s. However, ZFNs remained out of reach for most research labs because of the difficulty of production, high costs, and modest efficacy in many applications. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were built upon a DNA binding system discovered in a group of plant bacterial pathogens and broadened custom nuclease technology, showing significant improvements in both targeting flexibility and efficiency. Perhaps most importantly, TALENs are open source and easy to produce, providing zebrafish laboratories around the world with affordable tools that can be made in-house rapidly, at low cost, and with reliably high activity. Now a new system for targeted genome engineering derived from the CRISPR\/Cas system in eubacteria and archaea promises to simplify this process further. Together, these tools will help overcome many of the bottlenecks that have constrained gene targeting in zebrafish, paving the way for advanced genome engineering applications in this model teleost.","224":"Two Australian researchers specializing in China's creative industries examine recent developments in southern China commonly associated with the shanzhai phenomenon (e. g., production and sale of cheap local facsimiles of globally branded goods). While shanzhai is often condemned as the embodiment of China's \"knock-off\" industries, the authors argue that it might be more appropriately viewed as an instance of China's emerging creative economy and an example of rapid prototyping. The paper traces the evolution of shanzhai mobile phones and the materialization of the shanzhai ethos in popular culture. In arguing that shanzhai provides inputs into creative industries, the paper describes the fuzzy boundary between formal and informal culture and notes the interaction between three spheres of activity: official culture, the market, and grassroots culture.

Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a set of numerical studies and experimental validations on an in-house cable-stayed bridge model in terms of the accuracy of identified dynamic properties.","229":["Purpose - The paper's aim is to describe the world of retrocomputing, a constellation of largely non-professional practices involving old computing technology. It seeks to show how retrocomputing serves the goals of collection and preservation, particularly in regards to historic software, and how retrocomputing practices challenge traditional notions of authenticity. It then seeks to propose an alternative conceptualization and suggest new avenues for collaboration between retrocomputing practitioners and memory institutions.","Design\/methodology\/approach - The paper is based on extensive observation of retrocomputing projects, conducted primarily online.","Findings - Retrocomputing includes many activities that can be seen as constituting collection and preservation. At the same time, it is often transformative, producing assemblages that \"remix\" fragments from the past with newer elements or joining together historic components that were never combined before. While such \"remix\" may seem to undermine preservation, it also allows for fragments of computing history to be reintegrated into a living, ongoing practice, contributing to preservation in a broader sense. The seemingly unorganized nature of retrocomputing assemblages also provides space for alternative \"situated knowledges\" and histories of computing, which can sometimes be quite sophisticated.","Research limitations\/implications - Retrocomputing challenges established notions of collection and preservation. A \"situated knowledges\" perspective provides a possible resolution. Practical implications - Retrocomputing presents memory institutions (and libraries in particular) with an opportunity for new forms of collaboration in collection and preservation of software applications.","Originality\/value - The paper puts at the center the ways in which retrocomputing challenges the established notions of collection and preservation. It offers alternative conceptualizations that suggest new forms of collaboration."],"231":null,"233":"Through the case of the Helix_T wind turbine project, this article sets out to argue two points: first, on a theoretical level, that Commons-based peer production, in conjunction with the emerging technological capabilities of three-dimensional printing, can also produce promising hardware, globally designed and locally produced. Second, the Commons-oriented wind turbine examined here is also meant to practically contribute to the quest for novel solutions to the timely problem of the need for (autonomous) renewable sources of energy, more in the sense of a development process than as a ready-to-apply solution. We demonstrate that it is possible for someone with partial initial knowledge to initiate a similar, complex project based on an interesting idea, and to succeed in implementing it through collaboration with Commons-oriented communities, while using peer-produced products and tools.

A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications.

With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an open hardware platform and easily accessible components.","As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures, records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1) collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware platform that allows for an effective way to compare different commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype sensors.

Doing-it-together (DIT) and the idea of community and shared experiences are at the root of DIY practice. This article discusses how the workshop and the event have become central to practitioners working in the field of DIY. Collective instrument building, the concept of the living installation, and performance are viewed as a holistic event. Some specific examples of the author's work known as Dirty Electronics are considered, where emphasis is placed upon experience rather than the 'something to take home' factor. These include the following works: ICA Solder a Score, Noise Shadow, Still and Cut & Thrust. Composing 'outside' electronics is regarded as a method for revealing processes that can be represented in other areas of the work beyond sound-generating circuits. The article also looks at how building circuits and sound devices acts as a way to create a tabula rasa, and how the idea of delegated performance, where instruments are played by 'non-experts', serves to establish a naive approach and authenticity in performance. Through the sharing of information online and in workshops, the DIY community has become knowledgeable, which has resulted in a community 'full of experts' and the growth of custom-designed circuits. The rise of discrete hand-held music players, such as the Buddha Machine, and the boutique synthesiser are also discussed, and the physical artefact and sound object are seen as a vehicle for the dissemination of ideas.

LDI can measure the particle velocity of a small (0.03 mm(2)) element of the surface of the sample along the direction of the laser beam. By measuring the particle velocity of the same surface element in three linearly independent directions and then transforming those velocities to Cartesian coordinates, three orthogonal components of the particle-velocity vector are obtained. Thus, LDI can be used as a localized three-component (3C) receiver of ultrasonic waves, and, together with a piezoelectric transducer as a source, it can simulate a 3C seismic experiment in the laboratory. Performing such 3C measurements at various locations on the surface of the sample produces a 3C seismogram, which can be used to separate the P-wave and two S-waves and to find the polarizations and traveltimes of those waves. Then, the elasticity tensor of the medium can be obtained by minimizing the misfit between measured and predicted polarizations and traveltimes. Computation of the polarizations and traveltimes of body waves inside a sample with a given elasticity tensor is based on the Christoffel equation. The predicted polarizations on the surface then are obtained using the anisotropic Zoeppritz equations. The type of velocity measured (phase or group velocity) depends on the acquisition geometry and the material properties. This is taken into account in the inversion procedure. A \"walkaway\" laboratory experiment demonstrates the high accuracy of this method.","259":"The paper presents a novel network architecture on demand approach using on-chip and-off chip implementations, enabling programmable, highly efficient and transparent networking, well suited for intra-datacenter communications.

The nearly global access to the solar resource coupled to innovation-driven decreases in the costs of PV provides a path for a renewable energy source to accelerate sustainable development. Open-source software development has proven to produce reliable and innovative computer code at lower costs than proprietary software through sharing development responsibility with a large community of invested individuals. Concepts of open-source design have been applied to other fields in an attempt to reap the same benefits realized within software development: however, applying open-source strategies to solar PV research is uncommon. This paper reviews and examines how open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry.

The learning objectives were developed in the context of an accompanying faculty development program at ETH Zurich; a set of interactive sequences and the oral exam were explicitly aligned to these learning objectives. The outcomes of the specialization project presentations and oral exams, and a student evaluation of the course, demonstrated that the ETHZ haptic paddle is a valuable tool that allows students to quite literally grasp abstract principles such as mechanical impedance, passivity, and human factors and helps students create a tangible link between theory and practice in the highly interdisciplinary field of pHRI.","300":"The interdisciplinary nature of robotics allows mobile robots to be used successfully in a broad range of courses at the postgraduate level and in Ph.D. research.

Analytical approaches capable of capturing the properties of such networks can therefore enhance our ability to make inferences from functional MRI, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the formal modelling of networks and offers a wide range of theoretical tools to quantify specific features of network architecture (topology) that can provide information complementing the anatomical localization of areas responding to given stimuli or tasks (topography). Explicit modelling of the architecture of axonal connections and interactions among areas can furthermore reveal peculiar topological properties that are conserved across diverse biological networks, and highly sensitive to disease states. The field is evolving rapidly, partly fuelled by computational developments that enable the study of connectivity at fine anatomical detail and the simultaneous interactions among multiple regions. Recent publications in this area have shown that graph-based modelling can enhance our ability to draw causal inferences from functional MRI experiments, and support the early detection of disconnection and the modelling of pathology spread in neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, neurophysiological studies have shown that network topology has a profound link to epileptogenesis and that connectivity indices derived from graph models aid in modelling the onset and spread of seizures. Graph-based analyses may therefore significantly help understand the bases of a range of neurological conditions. This review is designed to provide an overview of graph-based analyses of brain connectivity and their relevance to disease aimed principally at general neuroscientists and clinicians.

This reflects the assumption that the mapping between sensor signal patterns and activity classes is known at design-time. This cannot be guaranteed in mobile and pervasive computing, where unpredictable changes can often occur in open-ended environments. Run-time adaptation can address these issues. We introduce and formalize a data processing architecture extending current approaches that allows for a wide range of realizations of adaptive activity recognition systems. The adaptive activity recognition chain (adARC) includes self-monitoring, adaptation strategies and external feedback as components of the now closed-loop recognition system. We show an adARC capable of unsupervised self-adaptation to run-time changing class distributions. It improves activity recognition accuracy when sensors suffer from on-body displacement. We show an adARC capable of adaptation to changing sensor setups. It allows for scalability by enabling a recognition systems to autonomously exploit newly introduced sensors. We discuss other adaptive recognition systems within the adARC architecture. The results outline that this architecture frames a useful solution space for the real-world deployment of adaptive activity recognition systems. It allows to present and compare recognition systems in a coherent and modular manner. We discuss the challenges and new research directions resulting from this new perspective on adaptive activity recognition.","309":"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a semantic network data model that is used to create machine-understandable descriptions of the world and is the basis of the Semantic Web.

However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

The piston-assisted microsyringe (PAM2) is a rapid prototyping technology specifically developed for low-shear stress extrusion of viscous hydrogel solutions containing cells. In this article the working parameters of the system were established to guarantee the realization of spatially controlled hydrogel scaffolds. Moreover the shear stresses acting on the cell membrane during extrusion was investigated through a computational fluid-dynamic analysis. The computational models show that the shear stress on the cells is of the order of 100 Pa during the extrusion process. HepG2 cells encapsulated in alginate were then extruded into spatially organized hepatic lobule-like architectures and their viability and function were evaluated. The results show that the metabolic fingerprint of the cells is preserved with respect to controls and the cells are uniformly distributed through the gel scaffold.","319":"This article takes the political engagement of hackers as a prism for examining the relations between technological determinist thinking and collective action. The concept collective action framing' is borrowed from social movement theory to describe how hackers have appropriated notions of a post-industrial, information society in their struggles against intellectual property laws and state censorship. Hackers have reintroduced an element of conflict and antagonism into otherwise politically innocuous visions of post-industrialism. This residual of antagonism can be traced back to the roots of the post-industrial myth in Marxist, historical materialist theory. By exploring these origins, the article proceeds to compare the hopes invested by hackers in the emancipatory force of information technology with the earlier beliefs of labour movements that the forces of history were on their side. Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.","322":["Objective: To develop a guideline to help guide healthcare professionals participate effectively in the design, construction, and occupancy of a new or renovated intensive care unit.","Participants: A group of multidisciplinary professionals, designers, and architects with expertise in critical care, under the direction of the American College of Critical Care Medicine, met over several years, reviewed the available literature, and collated their expert opinions on recommendations for the optimal design of an intensive care unit.","Scope: The design of a new or renovated intensive care unit is frequently a once-or twice-in-a-lifetime occurrence for most critical care professionals. Healthcare architects have experience in this process that most healthcare professionals do not. While there are regulatory documents, such as the Guidelines for the Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities, these represent minimal guidelines. The intent was to develop recommendations for a more optimal approach for a healing environment.","Data Sources and Synthesis: Relevant literature was accessed and reviewed, and expert opinion was sought from the committee members and outside experts. Evidence-based architecture is just in its beginning, which made the grading of literature difficult, and so it was not attempted.

The homogeneity of surface strain distribution across the cell culture substrate was confirmed with ARAMIS deformation analysis. The proliferation marker, Ki-67, detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay performed on human atrial fibroblasts confirmed biocompatibility of this novel device. Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection\/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration. Field stimulation delivered through this system could induce rhythmic contractions in adult rat ventricular myocytes, with contractile characteristics similar to those paced in a standard field stimulation chamber. In conclusion, this bioreactor provides a novel tool to study the interaction between physical stimulation and cardiac cell physiology.","324":"Programmable system-on-chip (PSoC), which provides a microprocessor and programmable analog and digital peripheral functions in a single chip, is very convenient for mixed-signal electronic system design. This paper presents the experience of teaching contemporary mixed-signal electronic system design with PSoC in the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. An innovative teaching method was adopted, which involved designing a flexible experimental board, designing four experiments of different levels and with different teaching objectives, writing a textbook, and instructing students in out-of-class activities.

It offers inherent scalability of the number of antennas by a combination of multiple transceiver units and flexibility for both directional MIMO channel and multi-link MIMO channel measurements. This paper describes the principle of the channel sounding technique and formulates the signal processing that makes possible various scalable unit configurations. The influence of the transceiver imperfections such as I\/Q imbalance (IQI) and phase noise (PN) on the measurement accuracy is discussed, and a multitone allocation scheme that is robust against IQI is also introduced. Using computer simulations, the measurement accuracy in the presence of IQI and PN is evaluated using the normalized mean square error, which provides a design guideline for the realization of hardware.","329":"A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-domain channel measurement methodology is presented.

To test the feasibility of this method, a series of measurements is presented, employing a 4 x 4 dual-band (2.4\/5 GHz) MIMO test bed.","330":"This article seeks to balance and counter Indonesian and international critiques of new media art by examining to what extent this type of art can be considered avant-garde. It focuses on the Indonesian new media art community, The House of Natural Fiber (HONF), as a historically and socially specific interpretation of four key avant-garde principles: to break with the autonomy of art, engage with the praxis of life, provide utopian visions, and present aesthetic innovation. The HONF art projects explore the interaction between life, art, science and technology in both practical and aesthetic ways. They not only reflect on the tremendous impact of communication media and other technology on social and natural environments in Indonesia and worldwide, but they also provide scenarios for alternative ways of dealing with these environments. Aesthetically, they are innovative in their exploration of the field of presentation rather than representation.","331":"Among various approaches to eye tracking systems, light-reflection based systems with non-imaging sensors, e.g., photodiodes or phototransistors, are known to have relatively low complexity; yet, they provide moderately accurate estimation of the point of gaze. In this paper, a low-computational approach on gaze estimation is proposed using the Eye Touch system, which is a light-reflection based eye tracking system, previously introduced by the authors. Based on the physical implementation of Eye Touch, the sensor measurements are now utilized in low-computational least-squares algorithms to estimate arbitrary gaze directions, unlike the existing light reflection-based systems, including the initial Eye Touch implementation, where only limited predefined regions were distinguished. The system also utilizes an effective pattern classification algorithm to be able to perform left, right, and double clicks based on respective eye winks with significantly high accuracy. In order to avoid accuracy problems for sensitive sensor biasing hardware, a robust custom microcontroller-based data acquisition system is developed. Consequently, the physical size and cost of the overall Eye Touch system are considerably reduced while the power efficiency is improved. The results of the experimental analysis over numerous subjects clearly indicate that the proposed eye tracking system can classify eye winks with 98% accuracy, and attain an accurate gaze direction with an average angular error of about 0.93. Due to its lightweight structure, competitive accuracy and low-computational requirements relative to video-based eye tracking systems, the proposed system is a promising human-computer interface for both stationary and mobile eye tracking applications.","336":"The development of sensorimotor coordination in infancy is fundamental for regulating interactional dynamics with peers and adults.

In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces. Some of its specific applications, namely the estimation of the time-varying transfer function of an indoor powerline channel and the evaluation of the power spectral density of the noise affecting it, are illustrated to show the potentialities of the developed equipment.","340":"Meteor radar data are continuously collected by different radar systems that operate throughout the year. Analyzing this fast growing, large data set requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently most meteor echo routines search for underdense meteor trails, often discarding overdense and nonspecular meteor trails. This is because their main purpose is the study of mesospheric winds. But the study of meteor flux requires the unique identification of each type of meteor reflections. In this paper, a multilayer radar detection and classification algorithm is proposed to correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector. In this step, we start by selecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in order to detect all types of radar echoes; however, a high probability offalse alarm is often produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data collected from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas, Puerto Rico, on April 5, 1998. A total of 270 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, nonspecular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 50% of the labeled echoes as training samples and divided the rest 50% testing samples as 10 subsets for testing. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples. Details concerning implementation, feature extraction, and data visualization are presented and discussed.","342":"Aircraft with modular airframe components may offer significant flexibility in mission performance by enabling reconfiguration between sorties. This paper introduces an approach for optimizing a family of aircraft variants defined by a library of interchangeable components such as wings, tails, engines, and payloads. First, the combinatorial problem of composing interchangeable components into feasible aircraft variants and assigning the variants to missions is posed. Next, two methods are presented to determine optimal reconfigurable family designs. The methods are then applied to an example problem to define optimal families of modular unmanned aerial vehicles consisting of interchangeable wings and engines. The results indicate a rich trade space of family architectures and aircraft configurations that depends strongly on the type and diversity of the required missions.","344":"The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.","345":"The open hardware mobile manipulator (OHMM) is a new open platform with a unique combination of features for teaching robotics software and algorithms.

Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays.

One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food-and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license.","353":"CERN makes extensive use of the WorldFIP fieldbus interface in the LHC and other accelerators in the pre-injectors chain.

This work implements a low-cost teleoperated system to control a humanoid robot, as a first step for further development and study of human motion and walking. A human suit is built, consisting of 8 sensors, 6 resistive linear potentiometers on the lower extremities and 2 digital accelerometers for the arms. The goal is to replicate the suit movements in a small humanoid robot. The data from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted via two ZigBee RF configurable modules installed on each device: the robot and the suit. Replicating the suit movements requires a robot stability control module to prevent falling down while executing different actions involving knees flexion. This is carried out via a feedback control system with an accelerometer placed on the robot's back. The measurement from this sensor is filtered using Kalman. In addition, a two input fuzzy algorithm controlling five servo motors regulates the robot balance. The humanoid robot is controlled by a medium capacity processor and a low computational cost is achieved for executing the different algorithms. Both hardware and software of the system are based on open platforms.

For five years, this was the most affordable method for connecting computers. The development of this technology was guided by the idea that it should be controlled by its users. With reference to this experiment, it is argued that a shared ethical and\/or political vision can contribute to the establishment of norms within user communities encouraging their members to share information with each other. Thus, it is suggested that ethical and political convictions can be crucial for enabling collective innovation processes. This highlighting of normativity is intended as a complement to the common premise in Innovation Studies that users innovate to satisfy unfulfilled needs. In opposition to this view, it is argued that the needs of users are not a constant but something which emerge together with the transformation of the user community and the technology in question. Particular focus is placed on the tension between, on one hand, the norms and ethical-political motives of the user community, and, on the other hand, the needs satisfied through product development, both stemming from the same innovation process.","379":"This article describes the hardware design of the iCub humanoid robot.

Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) opened the door to the first custom nuclease-targeted genome engineering in the late 1990s. However, ZFNs remained out of reach for most research labs because of the difficulty of production, high costs, and modest efficacy in many applications. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were built upon a DNA binding system discovered in a group of plant bacterial pathogens and broadened custom nuclease technology, showing significant improvements in both targeting flexibility and efficiency. Perhaps most importantly, TALENs are open source and easy to produce, providing zebrafish laboratories around the world with affordable tools that can be made in-house rapidly, at low cost, and with reliably high activity. Now a new system for targeted genome engineering derived from the CRISPR\/Cas system in eubacteria and archaea promises to simplify this process further. Together, these tools will help overcome many of the bottlenecks that have constrained gene targeting in zebrafish, paving the way for advanced genome engineering applications in this model teleost.","391":"Two Australian researchers specializing in China's creative industries examine recent developments in southern China commonly associated with the shanzhai phenomenon (e. g., production and sale of cheap local facsimiles of globally branded goods).

As a result, the VT project contributes to bridging the digital divide in developing areas.","395":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing at a fast pace with new devices getting connected all the time. A new emerging group of these devices is the wearable devices, and the wireless sensor networks are a good way to integrate them in the IoT concept and bring new experiences to the daily life activities. In this paper, we present an everyday life application involving a WSN as the base of a novel context-awareness sports scenario, where physiological parameters are measured and sent to the WSN by wearable devices. Applications with several hardware components introduce the problem of heterogeneity in the network. In order to integrate different hardware platforms and to introduce a service-oriented semantic middleware solution into a single application, we propose the use of an enterprise service bus (ESB) as a bridge for guaranteeing interoperability and integration of the different environments, thus introducing a semantic added value needed in the world of IoT-based systems. This approach places all the data acquired (e. g., via internet data access) at application developers disposal, opening the system to new user applications. The user can then access the data through a wide variety of devices (smartphones, tablets, and computers) and operating systems (Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, etc.).","396":["THE LIFE CYCLE OF A RADIOSONDE The development of scientific instruments Was, only a few years ago, confined to universities and electronics companies having highly specialized human and\/or technical resources. With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an open hardware platform and easily accessible components.","As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures, records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1) collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware platform that allows for an effective way to compare different commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype sensors.

This prompted an outpouring of research work related to CR, including the publication of more than 30 special issue scientific journals and more than 60 dedicated conferences and workshops. Although the theoretical research is blooming, with many interesting results presented, hardware and system development for CR is progressing at a slower pace. We provide synopses of the commonly used platforms and testbeds, examine what has been achieved in the last decade of experimentation and trials relating to CR, and draw several perhaps surprising conclusions.

Extant studies are conflicting, especially with respect to the importance of the monetary reward as a motivation. Moreover, literature supports our premise from the individuals' motivations analysis viewpoint, but not from the companies' perspective. Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic.","413":"This study sought to determine the validity of a new system for assessing the displacement and average velocity within machine-based resistance training exercise using the Chronojump System. The new design is based on a contact bar and a simple, low-cost mechanism that detects the conductivity of electrical potentials with a precision chronograph. This system allows coaches to assess velocity to control the strength training process. A validation study was performed by assessing the concentric phase parameters of a leg press exercise. Output time data from the Chronojump System in combination with the preestablished range of movement was compared with data from a position sensor connected to a Biopac System. A subset of 87 actions from 11 professional tennis players was recorded and, using the two methods, average velocity and displacement variables in the same action were compared. A t-test for dependent samples and a correlation analysis were undertaken. The r value derived from the correlation between the Biopac System and the contact Chronojump System was >0.94 for all measures of displacement and velocity on all loads (p < 0.01). The Effect Size (ES) was 0.18 in displacement and 0.14 in velocity and ranged from 0.09 to 0.31 and from 0.07 to 0.34, respectively. The magnitude of the difference between the two methods in all parameters and the correlation values provided certain evidence of validity of the Chronojump System to assess the average displacement velocity of loads in a resistance training machine.","417":"OpenPMU is an open platform for the development of phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology. A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications.

The system design features the integration of a powerful onboard computer and the synchronization of IMU-Vision measurements by hardware timestamping which allows tight integration of IMU measurements into the computer vision pipeline. We evaluate the accuracy of marker-based visual pose estimation for flight control and demonstrate marker-based autonomous flight including obstacle detection using stereo vision. We also show the benefits of our IMU-Vision synchronization for egomotion estimation in additional experiments where we use the synchronized measurements for pose estimation using the 2pt+gravity formulation of the PnP problem.","419":"Do-it-yourself (DIY) in electronic music represents a new paradigm that is not just about DIY. Doing-it-together (DIT) and the idea of community and shared experiences are at the root of DIY practice. This article discusses how the workshop and the event have become central to practitioners working in the field of DIY. Collective instrument building, the concept of the living installation, and performance are viewed as a holistic event. Some specific examples of the author's work known as Dirty Electronics are considered, where emphasis is placed upon experience rather than the 'something to take home' factor. These include the following works: ICA Solder a Score, Noise Shadow, Still and Cut & Thrust. Composing 'outside' electronics is regarded as a method for revealing processes that can be represented in other areas of the work beyond sound-generating circuits. The article also looks at how building circuits and sound devices acts as a way to create a tabula rasa, and how the idea of delegated performance, where instruments are played by 'non-experts', serves to establish a naive approach and authenticity in performance. Through the sharing of information online and in workshops, the DIY community has become knowledgeable, which has resulted in a community 'full of experts' and the growth of custom-designed circuits. The rise of discrete hand-held music players, such as the Buddha Machine, and the boutique synthesiser are also discussed, and the physical artefact and sound object are seen as a vehicle for the dissemination of ideas. Finally, the question is asked: 'In DIY practice, where does the authentic document of the work lie?'","422":"Performance and total cost of ownership (TCO) are key optimization metrics in large-scale data centers.

Technical aspects of the mesh-phone implementation, such as design constraints and implementation details, are addressed. The technical feasibility is validated by describing the implementation of a prototype of the mesh-enabled phone over the Openmoko (TM) open platform. Besides technical feasibility also convenience of the addressed solution is analyzed in terms of the consumed power, and some \"energy-saving\" related enhancements are suggested to be applied to future user's devices.

The nearly global access to the solar resource coupled to innovation-driven decreases in the costs of PV provides a path for a renewable energy source to accelerate sustainable development. Open-source software development has proven to produce reliable and innovative computer code at lower costs than proprietary software through sharing development responsibility with a large community of invested individuals. Concepts of open-source design have been applied to other fields in an attempt to reap the same benefits realized within software development: however, applying open-source strategies to solar PV research is uncommon. This paper reviews and examines how open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry. The results show how successful open design and development methods can be created and utilized by identifying business models that provide PV researchers, turnkey suppliers and solar PV module manufacturers with the opportunity to utilize open-source design principles to accelerate innovation.

Second, the Commons-oriented wind turbine examined here is also meant to practically contribute to the quest for novel solutions to the timely problem of the need for (autonomous) renewable sources of energy, more in the sense of a development process than as a ready-to-apply solution. We demonstrate that it is possible for someone with partial initial knowledge to initiate a similar, complex project based on an interesting idea, and to succeed in implementing it through collaboration with Commons-oriented communities, while using peer-produced products and tools.

Despite of making up a rather heterogeneous public, DIYbio groups are organized around a concern to make biology accessible, easy and enjoyable. DlYbio combines an open source ethos, with a DIY will to do things and the joy to mess with biological matter. As biohacking is about de-composing and re-composing things, DIYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new and to the making of futures that this paper explores. Inspired by Heidegger's notion of the thing, I suggest that differing from institutionalized forms of biology, DlYbio produces things rather than techno-objects. I go into this point by first situating DIYbio in relation to synthetic biology and other instutionalised forms of biology. To explore how DlYbio takes on a particular approach to the making of the new, I look at a number of things that DlYbio groups have projected, designed and realized. I suggest that DlYbio combines a sort of individual craftiness and self-determination to do things with a praxis in which things are always in the making, waiting for the next realization. DIYbio take on an approach to the making of things and futures that is immediate and mundane.

The EtherBone core implementation connects a Wishbone (WB) Ver. 4 Bus via a Gigabit Ethernet based network link to remote peripheral devices.

LDI can measure the particle velocity of a small (0.03 mm(2)) element of the surface of the sample along the direction of the laser beam. By measuring the particle velocity of the same surface element in three linearly independent directions and then transforming those velocities to Cartesian coordinates, three orthogonal components of the particle-velocity vector are obtained. Thus, LDI can be used as a localized three-component (3C) receiver of ultrasonic waves, and, together with a piezoelectric transducer as a source, it can simulate a 3C seismic experiment in the laboratory. Performing such 3C measurements at various locations on the surface of the sample produces a 3C seismogram, which can be used to separate the P-wave and two S-waves and to find the polarizations and traveltimes of those waves. Then, the elasticity tensor of the medium can be obtained by minimizing the misfit between measured and predicted polarizations and traveltimes. Computation of the polarizations and traveltimes of body waves inside a sample with a given elasticity tensor is based on the Christoffel equation. The predicted polarizations on the surface then are obtained using the anisotropic Zoeppritz equations. The type of velocity measured (phase or group velocity) depends on the acquisition geometry and the material properties. This is taken into account in the inversion procedure. A \"walkaway\" laboratory experiment demonstrates the high accuracy of this method.","459":"With embedded systems becoming ubiquitous, there is a growing need to teach and train engineers to be well-versed in their design and development.

The architecture allows students to explore both the hardware and software issues associated with real-time and embedded systems. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended to train students in advanced concepts in embedded multiprocessor systems. This generic architecture has been used for two courses at the National University of Singapore-one on real-time embedded systems and the other emphasizing the hardware aspects of embedded systems. The project in the real-time embedded systems course has students develop a five-a-side soccer system on multiple field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards using embedded processors.

In particular, modelling of regular lattices and cellular microstructures as well as irregular porous media is discussed and illustrated.

In this paper, we present a general navigation system that enables a small-sized quadrotor system to autonomously operate in indoor environments. To achieve this, we systematically extend and adapt techniques that have been successfully applied on ground robots.

Moreover the shear stresses acting on the cell membrane during extrusion was investigated through a computational fluid-dynamic analysis. The computational models show that the shear stress on the cells is of the order of 100 Pa during the extrusion process.

However, the large volume of acoustic data and the lengthy and laborious task of manually analyzing these data have hindered broad application of this technique. To overcome these limitations, a generalized automated detection and classification system (DCS) was developed to efficiently and accurately identify low-frequency baleen whale calls. The DCS (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the DCS was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the DCS and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the DCS and several analysts.

Usually, web technologies have been introduced to complement the control systems with smart add-ons and user friendly services or, for instance, to safely allow access to the control system to users from remote sites. Despite this still narrow spectrum of employment, some software technologies developed for high-performance web services, although originally intended and optimized for these particular applications, deserve some features suggesting a deeper integration in a control system and, eventually, their use to develop some of the control system's core components. In this paper, we present the conceptual design of a new control system for a particle accelerator and associated machine data acquisition system, based on a synergic combination of a nonrelational key\/value database and network distributed object caching. The use of these technologies, to implement respectively continuous data archiving and data distribution between components, brought about the definition of a new control system concept offering a number of interesting features such as a high level of abstraction of services and components and their integration in a framework that can be seen as a comprehensive service provider that both graphical user interface applications and front-end controllers join for accessing and, to some extent, expanding its functionalities.","471":"Smart wireless sensors have been recognized as a promising technology to overcome many inherent difficulties and limitations associated with traditional wired structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Despite the advances in smart sensor technologies, on-board computing capability of smart sensors has been considered as one of the most difficult challenges in the application of the smart sensors in SHM. Taking the advantage of recent developments in microprocessor which provides powerful on-board computing functionality for smart sensors, this paper presents a new decentralized data processing approach for modal identification using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) algorithm, which is based on signal decomposition technique. It is shown that this method is suitable for implementation in the intrinsically distributed computing environment found in wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs). The HHT-based decentralized data processing is, then, programmed and implemented on the Crossbow IRIS mote sensor platform.

The ETHZ haptic paddle was developed for a new pHRI course offered in the undergraduate Mechatronics Focus track of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Twenty students engaged in this 2-h weekly lecture over the 14 weeks of the Autumn 2011 semester, complemented by a weekly 2-h laboratory session with the ETHZ haptic paddle. In pairs, students worked through three common sets of experiments before embarking on a specialization project that investigated one of several advanced topics such as impedance control with force feedback, admittance control, the effect of velocity estimation on stability, or electromyographic control. For these projects, students received additional hardware, including force sensors, electrooptical encoders or high-performance data acquisition cards. The learning objectives were developed in the context of an accompanying faculty development program at ETH Zurich; a set of interactive sequences and the oral exam were explicitly aligned to these learning objectives. The outcomes of the specialization project presentations and oral exams, and a student evaluation of the course, demonstrated that the ETHZ haptic paddle is a valuable tool that allows students to quite literally grasp abstract principles such as mechanical impedance, passivity, and human factors and helps students create a tangible link between theory and practice in the highly interdisciplinary field of pHRI.","473":"Most approaches to recognize human activities rely on pattern recognition techniques that are trained once at design time, and then remain unchanged during usage. This reflects the assumption that the mapping between sensor signal patterns and activity classes is known at design-time. This cannot be guaranteed in mobile and pervasive computing, where unpredictable changes can often occur in open-ended environments. Run-time adaptation can address these issues. We introduce and formalize a data processing architecture extending current approaches that allows for a wide range of realizations of adaptive activity recognition systems. The adaptive activity recognition chain (adARC) includes self-monitoring, adaptation strategies and external feedback as components of the now closed-loop recognition system. We show an adARC capable of unsupervised self-adaptation to run-time changing class distributions. It improves activity recognition accuracy when sensors suffer from on-body displacement. We show an adARC capable of adaptation to changing sensor setups. It allows for scalability by enabling a recognition systems to autonomously exploit newly introduced sensors. We discuss other adaptive recognition systems within the adARC architecture. The results outline that this architecture frames a useful solution space for the real-world deployment of adaptive activity recognition systems. It allows to present and compare recognition systems in a coherent and modular manner. We discuss the challenges and new research directions resulting from this new perspective on adaptive activity recognition.","474":"The interdisciplinary nature of robotics allows mobile robots to be used successfully in a broad range of courses at the postgraduate level and in Ph.D. research. Practical industrial-like mobile robotic demonstrations encourage students and increase their motivation by providing them with learning benefits not achieved with traditional educational robotic platforms.

Besides learning engineering concepts, in performing industrial-like exercises, students develop valuable skills such as teamwork and the capacity to solve problems similar to those they may encounter in a real industrial environment. The developed infrastructure represents a valuable platform for robotic education that can be used in many different disciplines as a way to demonstrate how to cope with the difficulties and challenges related to the development of industrial infrastructure systems. The platform evaluation proved its ability to inculcate the expected engineering skills. A novel approach is adopted through the use of multidisciplinary and close-to-industrial-reality platforms developed under an incremental approach and using an open and customizable structure.","476":"Misconceptions about the nature of the computing disciplines pose a serious problem to university faculties that offer computing degrees, as students enrolling on their programmes may come to realise that their expectations are not met by reality. This frequently results in the students early disengagement from the subject of their degrees which in turn can lead to excessive wastage, that is, reduced retention. In this paper, we report on our academic groups attempts within creative computing degrees at a UK university to counter these problems through the introduction of a 6 week long project that newly enrolled students embark on at the very beginning of their studies. This group project, involving the creation of a 3D etch-a-sketch-like computer graphics application with a hardware interface, provides a breadth-first, activity-led introduction to the students chosen academic discipline, aiming to increase student engagement while providing a stimulating learning experience with the overall goal to increase retention. We present the methods and results of two iterations of these projects in the 2009\/2010 and 2010\/2011 academic years, and conclude that the approach worked well for these cohorts, with students expressing increased interest in their chosen discipline, in addition to noticeable improvements in retention following the first year of the students studies.","481":"Although several brain regions show significant specialization, higher functions such as cross-modal information integration, abstract reasoning and conscious awareness are viewed as emerging from interactions across distributed functional networks. Analytical approaches capable of capturing the properties of such networks can therefore enhance our ability to make inferences from functional MRI, electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the formal modelling of networks and offers a wide range of theoretical tools to quantify specific features of network architecture (topology) that can provide information complementing the anatomical localization of areas responding to given stimuli or tasks (topography). Explicit modelling of the architecture of axonal connections and interactions among areas can furthermore reveal peculiar topological properties that are conserved across diverse biological networks, and highly sensitive to disease states. The field is evolving rapidly, partly fuelled by computational developments that enable the study of connectivity at fine anatomical detail and the simultaneous interactions among multiple regions. Recent publications in this area have shown that graph-based modelling can enhance our ability to draw causal inferences from functional MRI experiments, and support the early detection of disconnection and the modelling of pathology spread in neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, neurophysiological studies have shown that network topology has a profound link to epileptogenesis and that connectivity indices derived from graph models aid in modelling the onset and spread of seizures. Graph-based analyses may therefore significantly help understand the bases of a range of neurological conditions. This review is designed to provide an overview of graph-based analyses of brain connectivity and their relevance to disease aimed principally at general neuroscientists and clinicians.

The extension may be used to transform what is traditionally a swarm robotics platform into a self-reconfigurable modular robotic system. We introduce a modified version of a previously developed collective locomotion algorithm and present new experimental results across three different themes. We begin by investigating how the performance of the collective locomotion algorithm is affected by the size and shape of the robotic structures involved, examining structures containing up to nine modules. Without alteration to the underlying algorithm, we then analyse the implicit self-assembling and self-reconfiguring capabilities of the system and show that the novel use of 'virtual sensors' can significantly improve performance. Finally, by examining a form of environment driven self-reconfiguration, we observe the behaviour of the system in a more complex environment. We conclude that the modular e-puck extension represents a viable platform for investigating collective locomotion, self-assembly and self-reconfiguration.","486":"To simulate the cardiac niche, a bioreactor system was designed and constructed to incorporate cyclic stretch, rhythmic electrical stimulation, and constant perfusion. The homogeneity of surface strain distribution across the cell culture substrate was confirmed with ARAMIS deformation analysis. The proliferation marker, Ki-67, detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay performed on human atrial fibroblasts confirmed biocompatibility of this novel device. Cyclic stretch treatment for 24 h resulted in the perpendicular alignment of human atrial fibroblasts. An electrical stimulation system containing carbon electrodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge injection\/recovery studies, which indicated that increased corrosive reactions were associated with a higher input voltage and prolonged pulse duration. Field stimulation delivered through this system could induce rhythmic contractions in adult rat ventricular myocytes, with contractile characteristics similar to those paced in a standard field stimulation chamber. In conclusion, this bioreactor provides a novel tool to study the interaction between physical stimulation and cardiac cell physiology.","487":"The MIT Linear Electrostatic Ion Accelerator (LEIA) generates DD and (DHe)-He-3 fusion products for the development of nuclear diagnostics for Omega, Z, and the National Ignition Facility (NIF).

The concept collective action framing' is borrowed from social movement theory to describe how hackers have appropriated notions of a post-industrial, information society in their struggles against intellectual property laws and state censorship. Hackers have reintroduced an element of conflict and antagonism into otherwise politically innocuous visions of post-industrialism. This residual of antagonism can be traced back to the roots of the post-industrial myth in Marxist, historical materialist theory. By exploring these origins, the article proceeds to compare the hopes invested by hackers in the emancipatory force of information technology with the earlier beliefs of labour movements that the forces of history were on their side. Building on this comparison it is argued that technological determinism does not always lead to political resignation, but can also serve as a foundation for collective action.","497":"The development of sensorimotor coordination in infancy is fundamental for regulating interactional dynamics with peers and adults.

In fact, the properties of real world powerline channels are substantially different from those commonly exhibited by their wireless counterparts, so that standard methods for wireless channel sounding cannot be adapted to a powerline scenario. In this paper, after providing some general design guidelines for powerline channel sounding, a detailed description of a FPGA-based implementation of a wideband powerline channel sounder is provided. Such a tool is based on low cost hardware and is flexible, since it can be easily customized to user needs using a set of simple graphical user interfaces.

Next, two methods are presented to determine optimal reconfigurable family designs. The methods are then applied to an example problem to define optimal families of modular unmanned aerial vehicles consisting of interchangeable wings and engines. The results indicate a rich trade space of family architectures and aircraft configurations that depends strongly on the type and diversity of the required missions.","521":"Meteor radar data are continuously collected by different radar systems that operate throughout the year. Analyzing this fast growing, large data set requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently most meteor echo routines search for underdense meteor trails, often discarding overdense and nonspecular meteor trails. This is because their main purpose is the study of mesospheric winds. But the study of meteor flux requires the unique identification of each type of meteor reflections. In this paper, a multilayer radar detection and classification algorithm is proposed to correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector. In this step, we start by selecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in order to detect all types of radar echoes; however, a high probability offalse alarm is often produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data collected from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas, Puerto Rico, on April 5, 1998. A total of 270 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, nonspecular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 50% of the labeled echoes as training samples and divided the rest 50% testing samples as 10 subsets for testing. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples. Details concerning implementation, feature extraction, and data visualization are presented and discussed.","522":"Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS\/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.","523":["Purpose - The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points.","Design\/methodology\/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files.","Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system.","Research limitations\/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects.","Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication.","Originality\/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects.

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.

It analyses how the ideals held by DIY makers, such as openness, peer production, and individual empowerment, are formulated in relation to China's project of building a creative society and economy. To demonstrate, this article draws from long-term ethnographic research, including the setting up of China's first hackerspace, the proliferation of making, and partnerships between makers and manufacturers. China's makers are driven to reinvent what creativity, innovation, industrial production and citizenship mean today, simultaneously exploiting and challenging political rhetoric. By setting up hackerspaces, designing open technologies and starting up businesses, they craft alternative subject positions, for themselves and others. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, it fills a gap in current research by providing an account of a culture of technology production. Second, it proposes the analytical lens of 'making subjectivities' to open up the concept of the netizen, illustrating the importance for Chinese Internet research to consider not only technology use, but also the culture and materials of its production. Third, it demonstrates that maker culture is better understood as a parasitic culture rather than a counter culture, altering the system from within, contributing to our understanding of the relationship between technology use, production, society, activism and the state.","564":"Robotic swarms that take inspiration from nature are becoming a fascinating topic for multi-robot researchers. The aim is to control a large number of simple robots in order to solve common complex tasks. Due to the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms, current research in swarm robotics is mostly performed by simulation software. The simulation of large numbers of these robots in robotic swarm applications is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to the poor modelling of external conditions. In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost, open platform autonomous micro robot (Colias) for robotic swarm applications. Colias employs a circular platform with a diameter of 4 cm. It has a maximum speed of 35 cm\/s which enables it to be used in swarm scenarios very quickly over large arenas. Long-range infrared modules with an adjustable output power allow the robot to communicate with its direct neighbours at a range of 0.5 cm to 2 m. Colias has been designed as a complete platform with supporting software development tools for robotics education and research. It has been tested in both individual and swarm scenarios, and the observed results demonstrate its feasibility for use as a micro-sized mobile robot and as a low-cost platform for robot swarm applications.","568":null,"570":["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal instrumentation plays a key role in the treatment of spinal instability in patients with metastatic tumors. Poor bone quality, radiation, and diffuse osseous tumor involvement present significant challenges to spinal stabilization with instrumentation and occasionally result in postinstrumentation compression fractures. Vertebral cement augmentation has been effective in the treatment of painful tumor-related compression fractures. Our objective was to describe cement augmentation options in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures associated with spinal instrumentation in patients with metastatic tumors.","MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent percutaneous vertebral cement augmentation in the treatment of instrumentation-associated vertebral compression fractures between 2005 and 2011 were included in the analysis. Only fractures that occurred within the construct or at an adjacent level were included. The change in Visual Analog Scale and need for further surgery were analyzed.","RESULTS: Eleven patients met the inclusion criteria, with 8 tumors located in the thoracic spine and 3 tumors in the lumbar spine. The median time between instrumented surgery and vertebral augmentation was 5 months (1-48 months) and the median follow-up after cement augmentation was 24 months (4-59 months). A total of 22 vertebrae that were either within or immediately adjacent to the surgical instrumentation underwent vertebral augmentation. All patients reported a decrease in their pain scores (mean decrease: 6 Visual Analog Scale points; P < .003). One patient required reoperation after cement augmentation. None of the patients experienced vertebral cement augmentation-related complications.","CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral cement augmentation represents a safe and effective treatment option in patients with recurrent or progressive back pain and instrumentation-associated vertebral compression fractures."],"572":"The emergence of the Internet of Things increases the demand on embedded computer systems, which in turn requires the availability of specialized engineers in the near future.

This position emerges from the authors' respective engagements in ethnographic research and design engagements with a slum community center in Bangkok, Thailand, and with makers and entrepreneurs in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. In both cases, we found design to be a site of engagement with and interpretation of wider connections between different locales, and between local and global networks. We identify four crucial aspects of design for the purposes of this discussion: It is normative, concerned with function and the attainment of goals; it is practical, and oriented toward constraints and opportunities; it frames and defines problems concurrently with solving them; and it takes a systems approach that accounts for the broad context of the design situation. Approaching and participating in these aspects of design evolved in concert with our ethnographic fieldwork and analysis, allowing us to take design seriously without sacrificing an ethnographic commitment to nuanced description.

However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays. While technical solutions to the orientation problem exist, dissemination is often hindered by the lack of simple and inexpensive ways of distributing and duplicating tools.","Results: Here, we provide a cost effective method for the production of 96-well plate compatible zebrafish orientation tools using a desktop 3D printer. The printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose. Their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope. This enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns.","Conclusions: The designs are refined versions of previously demonstrated devices with added functionality and strongly reduced production costs. All corresponding 3D models are freely available and digital design can be easily shared electronically. In combination with the increasingly widespread usage of 3D printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users.

At the same time, firms need to retain exclusive control over some essential components to capture value from their product and\/or service system. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized, matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey data (n=309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases community members' involvement in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal value capture is softer than hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.","595":["Objective: Create a visual mobile end user development framework, named Puzzle, which allows end users without IT background to create, modify and execute applications, and provides support for interaction with smart things, phone functions and web services.","Methods: Design of an intuitive visual metaphor and associated interaction techniques for supporting end user development in mobile devices with iterative empirical validation.","Results: Our results show that the jigsaw is an intuitive metaphor for development in a mobile environment and our interaction techniques required a limited cognitive effort to use and learn the framework.

The objective is to find simple models that can be used to estimate accurately the real battery state and consequently the node lifetime. Running the model in the network nodes, we can provide the motes with the required information to implement applications that can be considered as battery-aware. The proposed methodology reduces the computational complexity of the model avoiding complicated electrochemical simulations and treating the battery as an unknown system with an output that can be predicted using simple mathematical models. At a first stage, during a setup period, the method starts with the measurement of several battery parameters under different environmental and operational conditions. After that, the method uses the previous collected data for building mathematical models, considering the linear regression or multilayer perceptron as the most appropriated. Finally, the models are validated experimentally with new measures. Results show the suitability of the method that produces accurate and simple models, capable of being implemented even in low cost and very constrained real motes.","608":"The Internet of Things is one of the ideas that has become increasingly relevant in recent years. It involves connecting things to the Internet in order to retrieve information from them at any time and from anywhere. In the Internet of Things, sensor networks that exchange information wirelessly via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee or RF are common. In this sense, our paper presents a way in which each classroom control is accessed through Near Field Communication (NFC) and the information is shared via radio frequency. These data are published on the Web and could easily be used for building applications from the data collected. As a result, our application collects information from the classroom to create a control classroom tool that displays access to and the status of all the classrooms graphically and also connects this data with social networks.","611":"Optical flow has been widely used by insects and birds to support navigation functions.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a survey of existing optical flow techniques for robotics navigation applications. Detailed comparisons are made among different optical-flow-aided navigation solutions with emphasis on the sensor hardware as well as optical flow motion models. A summary of current research status and future research directions are further discussed.","625":"This article explores the changing relationship between the academy and new public formations of scientific research, which we term \"civic technoscience.\" Civic technoscience leverages tactics seen in critical making communities to question and transform how and who can make credible and actionable knowledge. A comparison of two case studies is used. The first is a grassroots mapping process that allows communities to generate high-quality aerial imagery. The second is an academic-led project using environmental sensors to engage disparate audiences in scientific practice. These two projects were found to differ in their ability to form strategic spaces for community-based science, and suggest pathways to foster more robust relationships across the public-academic divide. By altering power dynamics in material, literary, and social technologies used for scientific research, we argue thatcivic technoscience enables citizens to question expert knowledge production through critical making tactics, and creates opportunities to generate credible public science.","638":["Purpose - This work aims to present the design of a new continuous tool-path strategy for open-source low-cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) machines, such as Fab@Home or RepRap; and the development of an innovative integrated tool to design and fabricate customized tracheal stents with any FDM machine and six patient parameters. Both contributions were validated and implemented by obtaining a customized medical-grade silicone tracheal stent.","Design\/methodology\/approach - For the design of the new deposition strategy, a Python programming language was used. The new tool-path strategy was proposed as a continuous path to avoid drops and gaps and to improve the accuracy of the final model. Meanwhile, patient parameters were obtained by medical doctors and introduced into the innovative integrated system. On the one hand, one mold generated automatically, and viewed with Matlab software, was fabricated with a Fab@Home machine, optimized with the continuous tool-path strategy. On the other hand, the same generated mold was viewed in SolidWorks\/Excel software and was fabricated using a commercial FDM machine. Finally, the mold was filled with medical grade silicone, and a silicone tracheal stent was obtained.","Findings - Path planning for extrusion technologies is still a major concern, especially for open-source FDM machines. The results obtained in this work show the benefits of applying the newly developed continuous tool-path strategy to optimize the performance and efficiency of these machines. In addition, the proposed innovative integrated system allows the fabrication of customized tracheal stents rapidly and affordably.","Practical implications - The possibility of obtaining customized tracheal stents is a worthy challenge. Medical doctors could play a more active role and interact during the design process, helping to obtain more suitable stents. The method proposed herein would provide the opportunity to obtain real values from the trachea of a patient in the operating room and quickly fabricate a customized stent that would fit the patient's trachea perfectly.","Originality\/value - The results obtained in this work are relevant and have future applications in both the medical and the additive manufacturing fields. The optimized tool-path strategy can help to improve and enhance the use of low-cost FDM machines. Moreover, the innovative automatic design approach to fabricate tracheal stents may open new market opportunities in the medical device field."],"643":"Communication is responsible for the majority of energy consumption in typical wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While transmission energy can be controlled at each node, reception energy is outside the control of the nodes because they usually do not know the arrival time of their packets and they cannot avoid overhearing packets directed to the other nodes in range. Energy-aware MAC protocols apply duty-cycling which keeps the radio module off for most of the time and wakes it up periodically, but they suffer from overhearing which has been addressed so far either by means of preambles or by means of separate wake-up channels. This paper proposes a complementary approach which exploits the hardware frame filtering capabilities provided by state-of-the-art radio transceivers. Extensive experiments performed on VirtualSense motes show that hardware frame filtering saves more than 50% of the energy spent in the reception of non-intended packets.","644":"This research on odometry based GPS-denied navigation on multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is focused among the interactions between the odometry sensors and the navigation controller. More precisely, we present a controller architecture that allows to specify a speed specified flight envelope where the quality of the odometry measurements is guaranteed. The controller utilizes a simple point mass kinematic model, described by a set of configurable parameters, to generate a complying speed plan. For experimental testing, we have used down-facing camera optical-flow as odometry measurement. This work is a continuation of prior research to outdoors environments using an AR Drone 2.0 vehicle, as it provides reliable optical flow on a wide range of flying conditions and floor textures. Our experiments show that the architecture is realiable for outdoors flight on altitudes lower than 9 m. A prior version of our code was utilized to compete in the International Micro Air Vehicle Conference and Flight Competition IMAV 2012. The code will be released as an open-source ROS stack hosted on GitHub.","648":"The consumer market is continuously pushing for smarter, faster, more durable and cheaper products with ever more complex and sophisticated functionality. Other fields such as safety-critical and dependable applications are not unaware of these requirements, and even impose others (e.g. certification). In the current multi-core era, industry and research entities are facing the important challenge of fulfilling all these requirements, which often impose the necessity for integrating components with different levels of dependability in a single hardware platform. In this scenario, new concerns appear with respect to safety certification of the resulting mixed-criticality systems (e.g. temporal and spatial isolation). This article describes the research effort that is being conducted within the FP7 MultiPARTES project, which is one of the initiatives launched by the European Commission to explore new solutions for developing certifiable mixed-criticality systems using heterogeneous multi-cores. The article explains the proposed development toolset for such systems, presents a proof-of-concept implementation and shows its applicability in a real-world application that needs to be certified, namely a wind-power turbine.

For each dimension of Boyer's original framework, we explain its epistemologies and practices. Next, we take a critical approach to inquiring how each dimension, reconsidered through the lens of social scholarship values and social media affordances, might be envisioned today. This exploration provides concrete examples of how scholars might enact social scholarship with what benefits and challenges.","662":"Improper camera orientation produces convergent vertical lines (keystone distortion) and skewed horizon lines (horizon distortion) in digital pictures; an a-posteriori processing is then necessary to obtain appealing pictures. We show here that, after accurate calibration, the camera on-board accelerometer can be used to automatically generate an alternative perspective view from a virtual camera, leading to images with residual keystone and horizon distortions that are essentially imperceptible at visual inspection. Furthermore, we describe the uncertainty on the position of each pixel in the corrected image with respect to the accelerometer noise. Experimental results show a similar accuracy for a smartphone and for a digital reflex camera. The method can find application in customer imaging devices as well as in the computer vision field, especially when reference vertical and horizontal features are not easily detectable in the image.

In this study, we demonstrate nonionizing and noninvasive photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) cystography using clinically relevant indocyanine green (ICG) in vivo. After transurethral injection of ICG into rats through a catheter, their bladders were photoacoustically and fluorescently visualized. A deeply positioned bladder below the skin surface (i.e., similar to 1.5-5 mm) was clearly visible in the PA and FL image using a laser pulse energy of less than 2 mJ\/cm(2) (1\/15 of the safety limit). Then, the in vivo imaging results were validated through in situ studies. Our results suggest that dual modal cystography can provide a nonionizing and noninvasive imaging tool for bladder mapping.","664":"Via a close navigation of a Google Street View (GSV) scene in Oslo, this article investigates the role the photographic image plays in what has come to be known as locative media' - an entire range of image software that runs on mobile devices using GPS signals to locate the user, and that emerged after the United States government decided to end the intentional degradation of the public GPS signal in 2001, fostering the development of navigable photo-maps such as GSV, photo-synths and other location-based image applications such as Augmented Reality. The authors first address the temporal discontinuities and gaps of the GSV database, which the user navigates as a spatially continuous image. Second, they show that the city is experienced as one and the same data space, simultaneously traversed both on-site and on-screen. Third, they critically interrogate the navigability of the GSV image afforded by real-time data processing based on mutual data exchanges between user location, hardware, software, network and database. They argue that the GSV image is what Harun Farocki, in an article on cybernetic warfare, has called an operative image', an image that no longer represents an object but is part of an operation. In fact, the users' trajectories feeding back into the database initiate a reverse operativity, which proves to be the more problematic side of ubiquitous locative media applications such as GSV.","665":"Via a close navigation of a Google Street View (GSV) scene in Oslo, this article investigates the role the photographic image plays in what has come to be known as locative media' - an entire range of image software that runs on mobile devices using GPS signals to locate the user, and that emerged after the United States government decided to end the intentional degradation of the public GPS signal in 2001, fostering the development of navigable photo-maps such as GSV, photo-synths and other location-based image applications such as Augmented Reality.

With the increasing popularity of open-source processes for developing both software and physical systems, there is a need to develop computational models of product evolution in such dynamic product developments scenarios. Existing studies on the evolution of products involve modeling products as networks, taking snapshots of the structure at different time steps, and comparing the structural characteristics. Such approaches are limited because they do not capture the underlying dynamics through which products evolve. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by presenting a generative network model for product evolution. The generative model is based on different mechanisms though which networks evolve-addition and removal of nodes, addition and removal of links. The model links local network observations to global network structures. It is utilized for modeling and analyzing the evolution of a software product (Drupal) and a physical product (RepRap) developed by open source processes. For the software product, the generated networks are compared with the actual product structures using various network measures including average degree, density, clustering coefficients, average shortest path, propagation cost, clustered cost, and degree distributions. For the physical product, the product evolution is analyzed in terms of the proposed mechanisms. The proposed model has three general applications: longitudinal studies of a product's evolution, cross-sectional studies of evolution of different products, and predictive analyzes.","675":"The Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA) is currently designing an unmanned aerial research system that is lightweight and has high-structural flexibility, code named the High Altitude Performance Demonstrator (HAPD).The project is framed within the Italian Aerospace Research Program, under the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Chapter. This unmanned aerial system is mainly aimed at developing and validating advanced modeling methodologies for flexible aircrafts. A compendium of the system is provided in this paper, together with a deeper discussion of how CIRA developed the structural and aeroelastic design of HAPD. Some experimental tests performed to validate the main concepts are also presented. The vehicle has an unconventional joined-wing configuration that mitigates undesired extreme flexibility, but that results in a more complicated design. First, aeroelasticity has been taken into account from the preliminary stages of design because flexibility significantly affects aircraft behavior. Second, the HAPD structure is redundant with regard to constraints (because of its joined wing), thus making the internal forces dependent on the stiffness distribution. For these reasons, the availability of an integrated methodology that can support the structural design is mandatory. The output of such a methodology consists of primary structure stiffness distributions (fuselage, wings, and vertical tail), compatibly with the absence of any aeroelastic instability, and structural failure under operative loads.","676":"In order to construct a green-light-regulated gene expression system for cyanobacteria, we characterized a green-light sensing system derived from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, consisting of the green-light sensing histidine kinase CcaS, the cognate response regulator CcaR, and the promoter of cpcG2 (P-cpcG2). CcaS and CcaR act as a genetic controller and activate gene expression from P-cpcG2 with green-light illumination. The green-light induction level of the native P-cpcG2 was investigated using GFPuv as a reporter gene inserted in a broad-host-range vector. A clear induction of protein expression from native P-cpcG2 under green-light illumination was observed; however, the expression level was very low compared with P-trc, which was reported to act as a constitutive promoter in cyanobacteria. Therefore, a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence derived from the cpcB gene was inserted in the 5 untranslated region of the cpcG2 gene, and the expression level of CcaR was increased. Thus, constructed engineered green-light sensing system resulted in about 40-fold higher protein expression than with the wild-type promoter with a high ON\/OFF ratio under green-light illumination. The engineered green-light gene expression system would be a useful genetic tool for controlling gene expression in the emergent cyanobacterial bioprocesses.","679":null,"685":"Geosensor networks and sensor webs are two technologies widely used for determining our exposure to pollution levels and ensuring that this information is publicly available. However, most of these networks are independent from each other and often designed for specific domains, hindering the integration of sensor data from different sources.

The objective of this project was to measure noise and air quality pollution levels in urban areas in Belgium using low-cost sensors. This paper presents the IDEA Environmental Measurement Cloud as a proof-of-conceptData-as-a-Service (DaaS) cloud platform that integrates environmental sensor networks with a sensor web. Our DaaS platform implements a federated two-layer architecture to loosely couple together sensor networks deployed over a wide geographical area with web services. It offers several data access, discovery, and visualization services to the public while serving as a scientific tool for noise pollution research. After one year of operation, it hosts approximately 6.5 TB of environmental data and offers to the public near real-time noise pollution measurements from over 40 locations in Belgium.","687":"Supporting the concurrent execution of multiple tasks on lightweight sensor nodes could enable the deployment of independent applications on a shared wireless sensor network, thus saving cost and time by exploiting infrastructures which are typically underutilized if dedicated to a single task. Existing approaches to wireless sensor network programming provide limited support to concurrency at the cost of reducing the generality and the expressiveness of the language adopted. This paper presents a java-compatible platform for wireless sensor networks which provides a thorough support to preemptive multitasking while allowing the programmers to write their applications in java. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested on top of VirtualSense, an ultra-low-power wireless sensor mote providing a java-compatible runtime environment. Performance and scalability of the solution are discussed in light of extensive experiments performed on representative benchmarks.","688":"Emerging mega-trends (e.g., mobile, social, cloud, and big data) in information and communication technologies (ICT) are commanding new challenges to future Internet, for which ubiquitous accessibility, high bandwidth, and dynamic management are crucial. However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.","690":"The timescales of biological processes, primarily those inherent to the molecular mechanisms of disease, are long (> mu s) and involve complex interactions of systems consisting of many atoms (>10(6)). Simulating these systems requires an advanced computational approach, and as such, coarse-grained (CG) models have been developed and highly optimised for accelerator hardware, primarily graphics processing units (GPUs). In this review, I discuss the implementation of CG models for biologically relevant systems, and show how such models can be optimised and perform well on GPU-accelerated hardware. Several examples of GPU implementations of CG models for both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations on purely GPU and hybrid CPU\/GPU architectures are presented. Both the hardware and algorithmic limitations of various models, which depend greatly on the application of interest, are discussed.","691":"The use of haptics in virtual reality and video games has received growing attention as a means of enhancing the sensation of immersion in these environments. The sensation of touching virtual objects not only augments the impression of reality but also can improve the performance. However, the design of haptic interactions is not an easy task, and it usually needs a great effort due to the absence of powerful prototyping toolkits. Thus, this article proposes a vibrotactile prototyping toolkit for Eccentric Rotating Mass actuators named VITAKI. The main objective of this platform is to facilitate the prototyping and testing procedures of new vibrotactile interaction techniques for Virtual Reality and video games. A detailed description of the design of the system is provided, presenting the hardware and software elements that make up the VITAKI toolkit. In addition, its application to two different examples to illustrate its use is provided. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of this toolkit is presented. This evaluation is divided into two main stages. On one hand, a study of Olsen's criteria is performed to analyze its general capabilities. On the other hand, a comparison with previously presented proposals is included too. These two analyses, together with other experiments where the devices created with the toolkit were tested by end users, highlight its main features and its advantages over other proposals.","695":"A wheeled robot for object transportation in a distribution center is emulated and presented in this paper. The robot follows a free trajectory which is controlled by artificial vision and fuzzy logic modules. The artificial vision system includes a webcam located in the upper part of the distribution center and it is used to calculate the location of the robot. Specifically, image segmentation technique of red color was implemented in the artificial vision system to determine the robot's position and orientation. The information obtained from the webcam is also used by the fuzzy controller to estimate the robot's velocity which is then send to the mobile robot wirelessly. The control of the motors and the wireless communication of the robot are performed by an Arduino platform which supports an Xbee module for communications. The image processing and fuzzy control are implemented on a PC using Matlab.","696":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of hyperspectral near-infrared (NIR) reflectance imaging techniques for detecting cuticle cracks on tomatoes. A hyperspectral NIR reflectance imaging system that analyzed the spectral region of 1000-1700 nm was used to obtain hyperspectral reflectance images of 224 tomatoes: 112 with and 112 without cracks along the stem-scar region. The hyperspectral images were subjected to partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to classify and detect cracks on the tomatoes. Two morphological features, roundness (R) and minimum-maximum distance (D), were calculated from the PLS-DA images to quantify the shape of the stem scar. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and a support vector machine (SVM) were then used to classify R and D. The results revealed 94.6% and 96.4% accuracy for classifications made using LDA and SVM, respectively, for tomatoes with and without crack defects. These data suggest that the hyperspectral near-infrared reflectance imaging system, in addition to traditional NIR spectroscopy-based methods, could potentially be used to detect crack defects on tomatoes and perform quality assessments.","700":"Farmers continue to show great differences in irrigation water use, even for a given location and crop. Irrigation advisory services have narrowed the gap between scientific knowledge and on-farm scheduling, but their success has been limited. The performance of sprinkler irrigation is greatly affected by factors such as wind speed, whose short-time variability requires tactical adjustments of the irrigation schedule. Mounting energy costs often require the consideration of interday and intraday tariff evolution. Opportunities have arisen that allow these challenges to be addressed through irrigation controllers guided by irrigation and crop simulation models. Remote control systems are often installed in collective pressurized irrigation networks. Agrometeorological information networks are available in regions worldwide. Water users' associations use specialized databases for water management. Different configurations of irrigation controllers based on simulation models can develop, continuously update, and execute irrigation schedules aiming at maximizing irrigation adequacy and water productivity. Bottlenecks requiring action in the fields of research, development, and innovation are analyzed, with the goal of establishing agendas leading to the implementation and commercial deployment of advanced controllers for solid-set irrigation.","703":null,"704":"Vessel maintenance entails periodic visual inspections of the internal and external parts of the hull in order to detect the typical defective situations affecting metallic structures, such as coating breakdown, corrosion, cracks, etc. The main goal of project MINOAS is the automation of the inspection process, currently undertaken by human surveyors, by means of a fleet of robotic agents. This paper overviews an approach to the inspection problem based on an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) which, as part of this fleet, is in charge of regularly supplying images that can teleport the surveyor from a base station to the areas of the hull to be inspected. The control software approach adopted for the MAV is fully described, with a special emphasis on the self-localization capabilities of the vehicle.

Aggregation can be classified as cue-based or self-organized. In cue-based aggregation, there is a cue in the environment that points to the aggregation area, whereas in self-organized aggregation no cue is present. In this paper, we proposed a novel fuzzy-based method for cue-based aggregation based on the state-of-the-art BEECLUST algorithm. In particular, we proposed three different methods: naive, that uses a deterministic decision-making mechanism; vector-averaging, using a vectorial summation of all perceived inputs; and fuzzy, that uses a fuzzy logic controller. We used different experiment settings: one-source and two-source environments with static and dynamic conditions to compare all the methods. We observed that the fuzzy method outperformed all the other methods and it is the most robust method against noise.","709":"A distributed multistage software router (MSSR) is composed by several interconnected software routers running on personal computers (PCs). The MSSR architecture overcomes scalability and performance issues of single software router by providing parallel forwarding paths. Like many networking devices, a MSSR must be sized for peak traffic load, which implies energy inefficiency at low loads. Thus, we focus on energy saving schemes to improve the router energy efficiency by dynamically adapting the MSSR architecture to the currently offered load. We first introduce an optimal energy saving algorithm defined as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Then, heuristic solutions, named differential algorithms are discussed. While the optimal approach provides higher energy savings, the heuristics avoid the complete MSSR reconfiguration, thus reducing forwarding delays and minimizing service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic algorithms, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserve the load proportional energy demand characteristics of the optimal algorithm, with a minimal loss of efficiency, largely compensated by algorithm simplicity.

This paper presents a model and its hardware real-time architecture in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to be integrated in a robotic system that emulates this powerful biological process. It is based on the combination of bottom-up saliency and top-down task-dependent modulation. The bottom-up stream is deployed including local energy, orientation, color opponencies, and motion maps. The most novel part of this work is the saliency modulation by two high-level features: 1) optical flow and 2) disparity. Furthermore, the influence of the features may be adjusted depending on the application. The proposed system reaches 180 fps for resolution. Finally, an example shows its modulation potential for driving assistance systems.","712":"In a millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system with transmit\/receive (Tx\/Rx) beamforming antennas, small variation in device behavior or an environmental change can destroy beam alignment, resulting in power loss in the received signal. In this situation, the beam-tracking technique purely based on the received signal is not effective because both behavioral changes (rotation, displacement) and environmental changes (blockage) result in power loss in the received signal. In this paper, a motion sensor based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as well as an electrical signal is used for beam tracking to identify the cause of beam error, and an efficient beam-tracking technique is proposed. The motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and geo-magnetic sensor are composed of an attitude heading reference system (AHRS) and a zero-velocity detector (ZVD). The AHRS estimates the rotation angle and the ZVD detects whether the device moves. The proposed technique tracks a beam by handling the specific situation depending on the cause of beam error, minimizing the tracking overhead. The performance of the proposed beam-tracking technique is evaluated by simulations in three typical scenarios.","714":"As additive manufacturing of mechanical parts gains broad acceptance, efforts to embed electronic or electromechanical components in these parts are intensifying. We discuss recent work in printable electronics and introduce an alternative, which we call Bitblox. Bitblox are small, modular, interconnecting blocks that embed simple electromechanical connectivity and functionality. Not all blocks are identical; instead the unique combinations and positions of Bitblox within an assembly determine the mechanical and electrical properties of the assembly. We describe the design details of Bitblox, compare them to similar materials, and demonstrate their use in a working three-dimensional printer through several examples.","716":"Internet broadband access is becoming a reality in many countries. To fully exploit the benefits from high-speed connection, both suitable home network connectivity and advanced services support have to be made available to the user.

However, prior studies of this approach have been limited and have not considered a high degree of antenna reconfigurability. This paper uses simulations and experimental measurements to characterize the impact of reconfigurable antenna complexity on the performance of key establishment in different static propagation environments and in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. The results demonstrate that reconfigurable antennas can significantly enhance the security, even when the eavesdropper antennas are adjacent to or surround one of the legitimate nodes. The results further demonstrate that increasing the number of reconfigurable parasitic elements notably increases the achieved performance.","721":"Understanding the complex properties of electronic and spintronic devices at the micro-and nanoscale is a topic of intense current interest as it becomes increasingly important for scientific progress and technological applications. In operando characterization of such devices by scanning probe techniques is particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have developed a scanning probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard force imaging (atomic, magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical transport measurements. We utilize flexible and inexpensive FPGA (field-programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework developed in National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of microscope operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables sensitive, real-time cantilever frequency-shift detection. Using this system, we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy of an electrically biased graphene field-effect transistor device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport also enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided by the scanned cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in the experimental sciences and the openness of our software solution, our system permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport measurements by providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a measurement (input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also enables precise control of timing (synchronization of scanning and transport operations) and implementation of sophisticated feedback protocols, and thus should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.

Furthermore, a multi-scale ORB feature based method is implemented and integrated into the SLAM framework for landing site detection. We use a RANSAC-based method to locate the landing site within the map of the SLAM system, taking advantage of those map points associated with the detected landing site. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented vision system in autonomous flights, both indoor and in challenging outdoor environment.","724":null,"726":"Electrical stimulation (ES) of cells has been shown to induce a variety of responses, such as cytoskeleton rearrangements, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In this study, we have investigated whether monophasic and biphasic pulsed ES could exert any effect on the proliferation and differentiation of human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) isolated from human heart fragments. Cells were cultured under continuous exposure to monophasic or biphasic ES with fixed cycles for 1 or 3 days. Results indicate that neither stimulation protocol affected cell viability, while the cell shape became more elongated and reoriented more perpendicular to the electric field direction. Moreover, the biphasic ES clearly induced the upregulation of early cardiac transcription factors, MEF2D, GATA-4, and Nkx2.5, as well as the de novo expression of the late cardiac sarcomeric proteins, troponin T, cardiac alpha actinin, and SERCA 2a. Both treatments increased the expression of connexin 43 and its relocation to the cell membrane, but biphasic ES was faster and more effective. Finally, when hCPCs were exposed to both monophasic and biphasic ES, they expressed de novo the mRNA of the voltage-dependent calcium channel Cav 3.1((1G)) subunit, which is peculiar of the developing heart. Taken together, these results show that ES alone is able to set the conditions for early differentiation of adult hCPCs toward a cardiac phenotype.","727":"In this paper, we present a distributed control strategy, enabling agents to converge onto and travel along a consensually selected curve among a class of closed planar curves. Individual agents identify the number of neighbors within a finite circular sensing range and obtain information from their neighbors through local communication. The information is then processed to update the control parameters and force the swarm to converge onto and circulate along the aforementioned planar curve. The proposed mathematical framework is based on stochastic differential equations driven by white Gaussian noise (diffusion processes). Using this framework, there is maximum probability that the swarm dynamics will be driven toward the consensual closed planar curve. In the simplest configuration where a circular consensual curve is obtained, we are able to derive an analytical expression that relates the radius of the circular formation to the agent's interaction range. Such an intimate relation is also illustrated numerically for more general curves. The agent-based control strategy is then translated into a distributed Braitenberg-inspired one. The proposed robotic control strategy is then validated by numerical simulations and by implementation on an actual robotic swarm. It can be used in applications that involve large numbers of locally interacting agents, such as traffic control, deployment of communication networks in hostile environments, or environmental monitoring.","728":"This paper presents the TraxBot robot and its full integration in the Robotic Operating System (ROS). The TraxBot is a compact mobile robotic platform developed and assembled at the Institute of Systems and Robots (ISR) Coimbra. The goal in this work is to drastically decrease the development time, providing hardware abstraction and intuitive operation modes, allowing researchers to focus in their main research motivations, e.g., search and rescue, multi-robot surveillance or swarm robotics. The potentialities of the TraxBot are described which, combined with the ROS driver developed, provide several tools for data analysis and easiness of interaction between multiple robots, sensors and tele-operation devices. To validate the approach, diverse experimental tests using real and virtual simulated robots were conducted.","733":"Localization microscopy achieves nanoscale spatial resolution by iterative localization of sparsely activated molecules, which generally leads to a long acquisition time. By implementing advanced algorithms to treat overlapping point spread functions (PSFs), imaging of densely activated molecules can improve the limited temporal resolution, as has been well demonstrated in two-dimensional imaging. However, three-dimensional (3D) localization of high-density data remains challenging since PSFs are far more similar along the axial dimension than the lateral dimensions. Here, we present a new, high-density 3D imaging system and algorithm. The hybrid system is implemented by combining astigmatic and biplane imaging. The proposed 3D reconstruction algorithm is extended from our state-of-the art 2D high-density localization algorithm. Using mutual coherence analysis of model PSFs, we validated that the hybrid system is more suitable than astigmatic or biplane imaging alone for 3D localization of high-density data. The efficacy of the proposed method was confirmed via simulation and real data of microtubules. Furthermore, we also successfully demonstrated fluorescent-protein-based live cell 3D localization microscopy with a temporal resolution of just 3 seconds, capturing fast dynamics of the endoplasmic recticulum.

Replicating the robustness and efficiency of biological visual motion estimation in artificial systems would significantly enhance the capabilities of future robotic agents. Twenty five years ago, in this very journal, Carver Mead outlined his argument for replicating biological processing in silicon circuits. His vision served as the foundation for the field of neuromorphic engineering, which has experienced a rapid growth in interest over recent years as the ideas and technologies mature. Replicating biological visual sensing was one of the first tasks attempted in the neuromorphic field. In this paper, we focus specifically on the task of visual motion estimation. We describe the task itself, present the progression of works from the early first attempts through to the modern day state-of-the-art, and provide an outlook for future directions in the field.","741":"We investigated changes in functional network architecture in amnestic mild cognitive impairment using graph-based analysis of task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging and fine cortical parcellation. Widespread disconnection was observed primarily in cortical hubs known to manifest early Alzheimer's disease pathology, namely precuneus, parietal lobules, supramarginal and angular gyri, and cuneus, with additional involvement of subcortical regions, sensorimotor cortex and insula. The connectivity changes determined using graph-based analysis significantly exceed those detected using independent component analysis both in amplitude and topographical extent, and are largely decoupled from the presence of overt atrophy. This superior ability of graph-based analysis to detect disease-related disconnection highlights its potential use in the determination of biomarkers of early dementia. Graph-based analysis source code is provided as supplementary material.","747":"The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality, with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer sectors. At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.","748":"The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP\/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.","749":"Non-contacting acoustic and ultrasonic measurements are of interest in applications ranging from nondestructive evaluation to rock physics and medical imaging.

This article positions openness' as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of openness' from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons.

A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China's makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China's makers demonstrate that the future of makingif to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industryrests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China's first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics, they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines.

Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %.

The development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15% of the cost for materials.

The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy.

Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW) RepRap 3D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on process optimization of GMAW 3D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed, built, and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making stepwise adjustments to the manual voltage setting on the welder.

It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud.

Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that \"smart\" urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, \"smart city\" approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on \"smart\" initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different \"smart\" aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data.","Design\/methodology\/approach - To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources.","Findings - The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different \"smart\" aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data.","Research limitations\/implications - Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services.","Practical implications - In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality.

The platform, which has been conceived to flexibly prototype such systems, demonstrates the feasibility of a wireless power supply and the use of a mu C circuit, for example for Lab-on-a-disk applications, thereby eliminating the need for cumbersome slip rings or batteries, and adding a cogent and new degree of freedom to the setup. The large number of sensors and actuators included demonstrate that a wide range of physical parameters can be easily monitored and altered. All devices are connected to the mu C via an (IC)-C-2 bus, therefore can be easily exchanged or augmented by other devices in order to perform a specific task on the disk. The wireless power supply takes up little additional physical space and should work in conjunction with most existing Lab-on-a-disk platforms as a straightforward add-on, since it does not require modification of the rotation axis and can be readily adapted to specific geometrical requirements.","836":"Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured, and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a \"positive feedback loop\" effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design, and education.

They rely on wireless communication technologies, and they have provided many benefits to society, such as monitoring road traffic in real-time, giving continuous healthcare assistance to residents and managing the environment. This article revisits key interoperability questions in heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple, modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture is composed by sensing, access network, Internet\/cloud and application layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security, have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover). Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring delays from the proposed low cost sunspot\/mesh and arduino\/mesh gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed.

In particular, novel assistive technologies are being developed to make accessible street navigation to impaired people. The solution that we propose in this new application domain of intelligent transportation systems is a framework for a safe point-to-point navigation, owing to high-detailed road graphs, including sidewalks, crosswalks, and generic \"obstacles.\" The system is based on a low-cost modular sensor box (embedded hardware) interfaced with a mobile\/phone application that acts as an intelligent navigator. The main novelty is the capability to sense the surrounding area while being able to perform a fast path replanning, owing to a real-time link to a remote server, if an obstacle is detected. The sensing is performed using different sensors, such as ultrasound, lidar, and a 77-GHz mid-range automotive radar (absolutely novel in the AAL context), which are processed and fused in the well-established robot operating system (ROS). We tested the framework by analyzing its performance in two different configurations and environments by using, respectively, a sonar and a laser rangefinder in a building scenario and a radar in an urban environment. Even if in both cases results demonstrated a quite good robustness in the obstacle detection with a quasi-real-time route replanning, we were mainly interested and succeeded in demonstrating the high flexibility and extensibility of our framework.","889":"It is proposed that using Ethernet in the fronthaul, between base station baseband unit (BBU) pools and remote radio heads (RRHs), can bring a number of advantages, from use of lower-cost equipment, shared use of infrastructure with fixed access networks, to obtaining statistical multiplexing and optimised performance through probe-based monitoring and software-defined networking. However, a number of challenges exist: ultra-high-bit-rate requirements from the transport of increased bandwidth radio streams for multiple antennas in future mobile networks, and low latency and jitter to meet delay requirements and the demands of joint processing. A new fronthaul functional division is proposed which can alleviate the most demanding bit-rate requirements by transport of baseband signals instead of sampled radio waveforms, and enable statistical multiplexing gains.

Here we provide a step-by-step protocol to enable any scientist to build a research-grade LED illuminator for live cell microscopy, even without prior experience with electronics or optics.

Load balancing schemes based on flow hashing, e.g., ECMP, cause congestion when hash collisions occur and can perform poorly in asymmetric topologies. Recent proposals to load balance the network require centralized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, or expensive specialized hardware. We propose a mechanism that avoids these limitations by (i) pushing load-balancing functionality into the soft network edge (e.g., virtual switches) such that no changes are required in the transport layer, customer VMs, or networking hardware, and (ii) load balancing on fine-grained, near-uniform units of data (flowcells) that fit within end-host segment offload optimizations used to support fast networking speeds. We design and implement such a soft-edge load balancing scheme, called Presto, and evaluate it on a 10 Gbps physical testbed. We demonstrate the computational impact of packet reordering on receivers and propose a mechanism to handle reordering in the TCP receive offload functionality. Presto's performance closely tracks that of a single, non-blocking switch over many workloads and is adaptive to failures and topology asymmetry.","894":"Hammertoe is one of the most common foot deformities. Arthrodesis or arthroplasty of the proximal interphalangeal joint using temporary Kirschner wire fixation is the most widespread method of surgical stabilization.

The purpose of the present study was to prospectively collect clinical and radiographic outcomes of operative correction of hammertoe deformity using a permanently implanted 1-piece intramedullary device. A total of 29 patients with 60 painful, rigid hammertoes were prospectively enrolled, clinically and radiographically examined, operatively treated, then followed and re-examined. The outcomes were measured in terms of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society lesser toe and visual analog pain scores.

Most fractures involving the pelvis, specifically the sacrum, can be effectively stabilized with iliosacral screws alone. However, significantly unstable fractures, particularly vertical shear patterns, as well as U-type variant sacral fracture patterns that create spinopelvic instability, require the addition of lumbopelvic fixation. The surgical technique involves neurologic decompression as necessary, multiplanar reduction of the pelvic ring and sacrum, and placement of stable fixation. Treatment of these severe injuries requiring lumbopelvic fixation is challenging and requires active collaboration between spine trauma and pelvis trauma surgeons.

Distributed invention power is organised and regulated through the pervasive securitisation of technoscience: surveillance and control of technoscientific fields as well as financialisation of its activities and research outputs. The securitisation of science reorders the traditional split between the public sphere, the private sector and the commons. The folding of each one of these spheres into the other underlies a constant, often antagonistic, oscillation between big science and open science.

In particular, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) many-core architectures have been adopted for multimedia and signal processing applications with massive amounts of data parallelism where both performance and flexible programmability are important metrics. However, this class of processors has faced many challenges due to its increasing fabrication cost and design complexity. Moreover, the increasing gap between design productivity and chip complexity requires new design methods. Nowadays, the recent evolution of silicon integration technology, on the one hand, and the wide usage of reusable Intellectual Property (IP) cores and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), on the other hand, are attractive solutions to meet these challenges and reduce the time-to-market. The objective of this work is to study the performances of massively parallel SIMD on-chip architectures with current design methodologies based on recent integration technologies.

Biological responses depend on tissue temperature; target tissue temperature needs to be precisely measured and controlled to achieve desired thermal effects. In this work, a unique photoacoustic (PA) sensor is proposed for temperature measurement during interstitial laser phototherapy. A continuous-wave laser light and a pulsed laser light, for photothermal irradiation and photoacoustic temperature measurement, respectively, were delivered to the target tissue through a fiber coupler. During laser irradiation, the PA amplitude was measured. The Gruneisen parameter and the bioheat equation were used to determine the temperature in strategic positions in the target tissue. Our results demonstrate that the interstitial PA amplitude is a linear function of temperature in the range of 22 to 55 degrees C, as confirmed by thermocouple measurement. Furthermore, by choosing appropriate laser parameters, the maximum temperature surrounding the active diffuse fiber tip in tissue can be controlled in the range of 41 to 55 degrees C. Thus, this sensor could potentially be used for fast, accurate, and convenient three-dimensional temperature measurement, and for real-time feedback and control of interstitial laser phototherapy in cancer treatment.","990":"In this paper, we propose a nonlinear controller that stabilizes unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-denied environments with respect to visual targets by using only onboard sensing.

The observer output is then exploited in a nonlinear controller designed with an integral backstepping approach, thus yielding a novel robust control system. By means of Lyapunov analysis, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. Extensive simulation and experimental tests with a quadrotor are carried out to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed approach. The control system runs fully onboard on a standard processor, and only a low-cost sensing suite is employed. Tracking of a target whose speed exceeds 2m\/s is also considered in the real-hardware experiments.","998":"The direction of sunshine or the installation sites of environmental control facilities in the greenhouse result in different temperature and humidity levels in the various zones of the greenhouse, and thus, the production quality of crop is inconsistent. This study proposed a wireless-networked decentralized fuzzy control scheme to regulate the environmental parameters of various culture zones within a greenhouse. The proposed scheme can create different environmental conditions for cultivating different crops in various zones and achieve diversification or standardization of crop production. A star-type wireless sensor network is utilized to communicate with each sensing node, actuator node, and control node in various zones within the greenhouse. The fuzzy rule-based inference system is used to regulate the environmental parameters for temperature and humidity based on real-time data of plant growth response provided by a growth stage selector. The growth stage selector defines the control ranges of temperature and humidity of the various culture zones according to the leaf area of the plant, the number of leaves, and the cumulative amount of light. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is stable and robust and provides basis for future greenhouse applications.","999":"In the Czech Republic there is an on-going debate and for the last year also legislative work on a Revenue Registry Act.

The strip is a physical display of virtual curves intersecting 3D virtual objects, and aims at allowing designers to evaluate the quality of shapes during the conceptual design phase of new products. The DHSSR consists of a servo-actuated developable metallic strip, which reproduces cross-sectional curves of 3D virtual objects. In order to generate the virtual curve intersecting the virtual object it has been implemented a hand gestural interaction system, which allows moving the curve or the 3D object. Specifically, through an interaction approach based on a magnetic pinch the user can move the virtual strip until reaching the desired position. Instead, an interaction modality based on index finger recognition allows moving the 3D object while the virtual curve is floating in space. The virtual curve generated by the interaction is used for deforming the physical strip. The hand gestural interaction system has been implemented by using low cost and open technologies, and combines an engine for interactive 3D content generation (Unity 3D), a motion capture sensor (LeapMotion) and the Arduino Leonardo board. In particular, the user's hands are tracked by means of the Leap Motion sensor. The Unity 3D environment is used to virtually render the virtual objects (curve and shape) and the virtual avatar of the users' hands. The virtual environment is connected with the Arduino Leonardo board in order to control the six servo-actuators of the DHSSR. The paper also presents some studies performed to evaluate the performances of the DHSSR system and the usability of the hand gestural interaction modalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A periodic micro-scanning movement of only a few degrees enables the vibrating compound eye to locate contrasting objects with a 40-fold greater resolution than that imposed by the interommatidial angle. In this study, we developed a new algorithm merging the output of 35 local processing units consisting of adjacent pairs of artificial ommatidia. The local measurements performed by each pair are processed in parallel with very few computational resources, which makes it possible to reach a high refresh rate of 500 Hz. An aerial robotic platform with two degrees of freedom equipped with the active CurvACE placed over naturally textured panels was able to assess its linear position accurately with respect to the environment thanks to its efficient gaze stabilization system. The algorithm was found to perform robustly at different light conditions as well as distance variations relative to the ground and featured small closed-loop positioning errors of the robot in the range of 45 mm. In addition, three tasks of interest were performed without having to change the algorithm: short-range odometry, visual stabilization, and tracking contrasting objects (hands) moving over a textured background.","1002":"Microorganisms act both as drivers and indicators of perturbations in the marine environment. In an effort to establish baselines to predict the response of marine habitats to environmental change, here we report a broad survey of microbial diversity across the Indian Ocean, including the first microbial samples collected in the pristine lagoon of Salomon Islands, Chagos Archipelago. This was the first largescale ecogenomic survey aboard a private yacht employing a 'citizen oceanography' approach and tools and protocols easily adapted to ocean going sailboats. Our data highlighted biogeographic patterns in microbial community composition across the Indian Ocean. Samples from within the Salomon Islands lagoon contained a community which was different even from adjacent samples despite constant water exchange, driven by the dominance of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechococcus. In the lagoon, Synechococcus was also responsible for driving shifts in the metatranscriptional profiles. Enrichment of transcripts related to photosynthesis and nutrient cycling indicated bottom-up controls of community structure. However a five-fold increase in viral transcripts within the lagoon during the day, suggested a concomitant top-down control by bacteriophages. Indeed, genome recruitment against Synechococcus reference genomes suggested a role of viruses in providing the ecological filter for determining the beta-diversity patterns in this system.","1003":"The role of social innovations in transforming the lives of individuals and communities has been a source of popular attention in recent years. This article systematically reviews the available evidence of the relationship between social innovation and its promotion of health equity. Guided by Fair Foundations: The VicHealth framework for health equity and examining four types of social innovation-social movements, service-related social innovations, social enterprise and digital social innovations-we find a growing literature on social innovation activities, but inconsistent evaluative evidence of their impacts on health equities, particularly at the socio-economic, political and cultural level of the framework. Distinctive characteristics of social innovations related to the promotion of health equity include the mobilization of latent or unrealised value through new combinations of (social, cultural and material) resources; growing bridging social capital and purposeful approaches to linking individual knowledge and experience to institutional change. These have implications for health promotion practice and for research about social innovation and health equity.","1004":"This paper proposes a new software composition method for automated machines that exploits their mechatronic modularity. It is demonstrated that desired behavior of a certain class of machines can be composed of behaviors of its mechatronic components, including fully decentralized scheduling and operation control.

The impact of the gyroscope bias is also assessed and an online estimator provided. The performance of the proposed estimator is validated and compared to current commonly used methods, namely the classical extended Kalman filter and two other nonlinear estimators in SO(3). Realistic simulations consider a quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicle subject to wind disturbances and whose sensors parameters have been identified from flight tests data.","1007":"The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) facilitates high-affinity presynaptic DA reuptake that temporally and spatially constrains DA neurotransmission. Aberrant DAT function is implicated in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. DAT is a major psychostimulant target, and psychostimulant reward strictly requires binding to DAT. DAT function is acutely modulated by dynamic membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and a PKC-sensitive negative endocytic mechanism, or \"endocytic brake,\" controls DAT plasma membrane stability. However, the molecular basis for the DAT endocytic brake is unknown, and it is unknown whether this braking mechanism is unique to DAT or common to monoamine transporters. Here, we report that the cdc42-activated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1, is a DAT endocytic brake that stabilizes DAT at the plasma membrane and is released in response to PKC activation. Pharmacologic and shRNA-mediated Ack1 silencing enhanced basal DAT internalization and blocked PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, but had no effects on SERT endocytosis. Both cdc42 activation and PKC stimulation converge on Ack1 to control Ack1 activity and DAT endocytic capacity, and Ack1 inactivation is required for stimulated DAT internalization downstream of PKC activation. Moreover, constitutive Ack1 activation is sufficient to rescue the gain-of-function endocytic phenotype exhibited by the ADHD DAT coding variant, R615C. These findings reveal a unique endocytic control switch that is highly specific for DAT. Moreover, the ability to rescue the DAT(R615C) coding variant suggests that manipulating DAT trafficking mechanisms may be a potential therapeutic approach to correct DAT coding variants that exhibit trafficking dysregulation.","1008":"Channel measurements are the prerequisite condition for the design of the next-generation high-speed railway (HSR) communication system. Because of the measurement restriction and measurement efficiency issues of applying conventional channel sounders in HSR scenarios, railway-network-based channel measurements are becoming quite attractive. In this paper, a method that employs the cell-specific reference signal in long-term-evolution (LTE) railway networks as the excitation signal to perform HSR channel measurements is presented. This method is implemented by a novel channel measurement system composed of existing LTE railway networks and a dedicated LTE receiver, which can efficiently collect the time-frequency-space channel data and is able to measure different communication links simultaneously. Based on this system, field measurements that consider both direct coverage and relay coverage schemes are conducted on the Beijing-to-Tianjin HSR in China. Statistical results, involving path loss, Ricean K-factor, root-mean-square delay spread, single-link spatial correlation (SC), and multilink SC, are derived, which not only confirm the viability of the proposed method but also provide realistic HSR channel characteristics for the research on future HSR communications.","1013":"The authors model the user innovation networks of NASA's International Space Apps Challenges and use social network analysis to empirically investigate the existence and impact of three drivers of innovation.

With an increase in the deployment of smart objects, IoT is expected to have a significant impact on human life in the near future. A major breakthrough in bridging the gap between virtual and physical worlds came from the vision of the Web of Things (WoT), which employs open Web standards in achieving information sharing and objects interoperability. Social Web of Things (SWoT) further extends WoT to integrate smart objects with social networks and is observed to not only bridge between physical and virtual worlds but also facilitate continued interaction between physical devices and human.

The photodiode pixel array can not only capture images but also harvest solar energy. As such, the CMOS image sensor chip is able to switch between imaging and harvesting modes towards self-power operation. Moreover, an on-chip maximum power point tracking (MPPT)-based power management system (PMS) is designed for the dual-mode image sensor to further improve the energy efficiency. A new isolated P-well energy harvesting and imaging (EHI) pixel with very high fill factor is introduced.

The dynamic network topology, the temporal and spatial variations in spectrum availability, and the distributed multi-hop architecture of CRAHNs mandate novel solutions to achieve time synchronization and efficiently support spectrum sensing, access, decision and mobility. In this article, we advance this research agenda by proposing the novel Bio-inspired time SynChronization protocol for CRAHNs (BSynC). The protocol draws on the spontaneous firefly synchronization observed in parts of Southeast Asia. The significance of BSynC lies in its capability of promoting symmetric time synchronization between pairs of network nodes independent of the network topology or a predefined sequence for synchronization. It enables the nodes in CRAHNs to efficiently synchronize in a decentralized manner, and it is also reliable to changes, faults and attacks. The findings suggest that BSynC improves convergence time, thereby favoring deployment in dynamic network scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It represents an inner periphery and inner colony of Austrian and European capitalism. This article analyses the political economy of the Internet in the Waldviertel. The Waldviertel is confronted with high rates of exploitation within the context of an imperialist division of labour, with transfer of value, unequal exchange, low wages, the exodus of the textile industry, high unemployment, depopulation of the countryside, a dismantling of public infrastructure, and a declining population. This analysis makes clear that the reality of the Waldviertel as inner periphery of the capitalist centres shapes communication in the region. Access to computers, the Internet and broadband is worse in the Waldviertel than in other regions. Internet and mobile speeds tend to be slower, making the region less attractive to information workers. There are also signs of an alternative economy in the Waldviertel that call imperialism into question. In the area of the information economy there is potential for founding socialist co-operatives for hardware, software, and social media that call the capitalist information society into question and struggle for alternatives.","1026":"This work proposes the design of Environmental Sensor Networks (ESN) through balancing robustness and redundancy.

Due to the very limited payload ability of the helicopter, a micro onboard vision system is designed to provide visual pose measurement. Then the attitude data obtained from a low cost micro inertial measurement unit (IMU) are fused with the visual measurement to provide accurate estimation of the helicopter's translational position and velocity. Nonlinear flight controller is designed to hold the quadrotor in a certain position and altitude without external ground motion capture system. Moreover, trajectory tracking ability is achieved with the help of a modified visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the good hovering and tracking control performance of the proposed design in GPS-denied indoor and outdoor environments.

The detection information returned from a mobile node is meaningful only if its location is known. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms based on color filtering technology called PCFL and ACFL. PCFL and ACFL aim at collaboratively accomplishing accurate localization of underwater mobile nodes with minimum energy expenditure. They both adopt the overlapping signal region of task anchors which can communicate with the mobile node directly as the current sampling area. PCFL employs the projected distances between each of the task projections and the mobile node, while ACFL adopts the direct distance between each of the task anchors and the mobile node. The proportion factor of distance is also proposed to weight the RGB values. By comparing the nearness degrees of the RGB sequences between the samples and the mobile node, samples can be filtered out. The normalized nearness degrees are considered as the weighted standards to calculate the coordinates of the mobile nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed methods have excellent localization performance and can localize the mobile node in a timely way. The average localization error of PCFL is decreased by about 30.4% compared to the AFLA method.","1033":"Distributed transmission rate tuning is important for a wide variety of IEEE 802.15.4 network applications such as industrial network control systems. Such systems often require each node to sustain certain throughput demand in order to guarantee the system performance. It is thus essential to determine a proper transmission rate that can meet the application requirement and compensate for network imperfections (e.g., packet loss). Such a tuning in a heterogeneous network is difficult due to the lack of modeling techniques that can deal with the heterogeneity of the network as well as the network traffic changes. In this paper, a distributed transmission rate tuning algorithm in a heterogeneous IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA\/CA network is proposed. Each node uses the results of clear channel assessment (CCA) to estimate the busy channel probability. Then a mathematical framework is developed to estimate the on-going heterogeneous traffics using the busy channel probability at runtime. Finally a distributed algorithm is derived to tune the transmission rate of each node to accurately meet the throughput requirement. The algorithm does not require modifications on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer and it has been experimentally implemented and extensively tested using TelosB nodes with the TinyOS protocol stack. The results reveal that the algorithm is accurate and can satisfy the throughput demand. Compared with existing techniques, the algorithm is fully distributed and thus does not require any central coordination. With this property, it is able to adapt to traffic changes and re-adjust the transmission rate to the desired level, which cannot be achieved using the traditional modeling techniques.","1035":"We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry.

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss.

Ease of deployment and reliability of the logging and transmission system is also addressed.","1063":"The cultural appropriation of ideas about hacking and opening knowledge have had significant impact on ways of developing participation in creating public interest knowledge and knowledge commons. In particular, the ideal of hacking as developed through studies of free and open source (F\/OS) has highlighted the value of processes of participation, including participatory governance, in relation to the value of expanded accessibility of knowledge, including knowledge commons. Yet, these means and ends are often conflated. This article employs three examples of projects where hacker-inspired perspectives on scientific knowledge conflict with institutional perspectives. Each example develops differently the relationships between means and ends in relation to authority and legitimacy. The article's analysis suggests that while hacker culture's focus on authority through participation has had great traction in business and in public interest science, this may come limit the contribution to knowledge in the public interest - especially knowledge commons.","1064":"Citizen science is increasingly being used in diverse research domains. With the emergence and rapid development of sensor technologies, citizens potentially have more powerful tools to collect data and generate information to understand their living environment. Although sensor technologies are developing fast, citizen sensing has not been widely implemented yet and published studies are only a few. In this paper, we analyse the practical experiences from an implementation of citizen sensing for urban environment monitoring. A bottom-up model in which citizens develop and use sensors for environmental monitoring is described and assessed. The paper focuses on a case study of Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab using NO2 sensors for air quality monitoring. We found that the bottom-up citizen sensing is still challenging but can be successful with open cooperation and effective use of online and offline facilities. Based on the assessment, suggestions are proposed for further implementations and research.","1069":"A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by different water quality related components (such as the presence of phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility.","1071":"The combination of open-source software and hardware provides technically feasible methods to create low-cost, highly customized scientific research equipment. Open-source 3-D printers have proven useful for fabricating scientific tools. Here the capabilities of an open-source 3-D printer are expanded to become a highly flexible scientific platform. An automated low-cost 3-D motion control platform is presented that has the capacity to perform scientific applications, including (1) 3-D printing of scientific hardware; (2) laboratory auto-stirring, measuring, and probing; (3) automated fluid handling; and (4) shaking and mixing. The open-source 3-D platform not only facilities routine research while radically reducing the cost, but also inspires the creation of a diverse array of custom instruments that can be shared and replicated digitally throughout the world to drive down the cost of research and education further.","1072":"Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.","1075":"Continuous hydrologic monitoring is limited in many regions of the world, creating serious knowledge gaps for water resources managers and scientists. Recent advances in open-source software and hardware technologies, such as the Arduino project, show potential for the development of low-cost (similar to$100) automated dataloggers required for continuous data collection. We developed an Arduino-based datalogger (the Ecohydro Logger) coupled with water sensors providing digital output to establish a hydrologic monitoring network in the data-scarce wet-dry tropics of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. While we experienced some challenges with a first iteration of our Arduinobased datalogger, an improved version was robust and able to capture long periods of high-frequency stream discharge data. Integration of the monitoring program into the local community was also key to successful deployment, allowing exchange of local knowledge and support. The accessible and low-cost nature of Arduino-based dataloggers can provide a means to extend continuous environmental monitoring into data-scarce regions.","1079":["3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the computer-guided process of fabricating physical objects by depositing successive layers of material. It has transformed manufacturing across virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes convenient and affordable desktop 3D printers. These are being used in the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast. The market predicts that within several years, 3D printers could be commonplace within the home; with so many practical uses for 3D printing, we anticipate that the technology will also play an increasingly important role in the laboratory.","?? ?????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????3D printing????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3D????????????????????????????3D??????????????????????????????????????????3D????????????????????????????????3D??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","?? ?? ????? ??? 3D ???? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ???????. ? ??? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????. ??? ???? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??? ???? 3D ???? ???????. ??? ??? 3D ?? ??? ??? ?? ????? ???? ???, ???? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ????. ?? ???(National Institutes of Health)? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ?? ???, 3D ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ? ??? ?????. ???? 3D ???? ?????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????. ??? ? ? ??? 3D ???? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?????. ??? ?? 3D ??? ?? ??? ??, ? ??? ?????? ?? ? ??? ??? ? ??? ?????.","?? 3D ??,???????,??????????????????????????????????????????????,?????????????????,???????3D ??????????????????????,????????? 3D ????,???????????????????????,???????????????,??????????????????(National Institutes of Health)??????????????????????,3D ?????????????????????,?? 3D ????????????????,?????????????????,?????,3D ??????????????? 3D ??????,????,??,????,??????????????????","?? 3D ?????????,???????????????????????????????????????????,?????????????????,?????????3D ??????????????????????,????????? 3D ????,??????????????????????????,???????????????,??????????????????

It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (J&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them.","1081":"The article describes the design phase, development and practical application of a smart object integrated in a desk lamp and called \"Smart Lamp\", useful to optimize the indoor thermal comfort and energy savings that are two important workplace issues where the comfort of the workers and the consumption of the building strongly affect the economic balance of a company. The Smart Lamp was built using a microcontroller, an integrated temperature and relative humidity sensor, some other modules and a 3D printer. This smart device is similar to the desk lamps that are usually found in offices but it allows one to adjust the indoor thermal comfort, by interacting directly with the air conditioner. After the construction phase, the Smart Lamp was installed in an office normally occupied by four workers to evaluate the indoor thermal comfort and the cooling consumption in summer. The results showed how the application of the Smart Lamp effectively reduced the energy consumption, optimizing the thermal comfort. The use of DIY approach combined with read-write functionality of websites, blog and social platforms, also allowed to customize, improve, share, reproduce and interconnect technologies so that anybody could use them in any occupied environment.","1084":"Scattering experiments are fundamental for structure analysis of matter on molecular, atomic and sub-atomic length scales. In contrast, it is not standard to demonstrate optical scattering experiments on the undergraduate level beyond simple diffraction gratings. We present an inexpensive Mie scattering setup manufactured with 3D printing and open hardware. The experiment can be used to determine the particle size in dilute monodisperse colloidal suspensions with surprisingly high accuracy and is, thus, suitable to demonstrate relations between scattering measurements and microscopic properties of particles within undergraduate lab course projects.","1085":"Having once been the headquarters of 'Made in China,' Shenzhen's industry is currently undergoing profound change. The appearance of new urban places for technological innovation is reviving the ageing industrial processes of this manufacturing city. It is supposed to transform Shenzhen into the Silicon Valley of hardware. Two groups, one local, the shanzhai community made up of entrepreneurs and companies historically based on a strategy of imitating highend products, and the other, a more international maker community, are thought to be the main drivers of this change using values of 'open innovation'. The building of this ecosystem relies largely on practices associated with being open-source. Like in California, open innovation contributed to the creation of resources for the development of a vast high-tech industry. This ethnographic field study shows how, while both communities, the international makers and the shanzhai, draw on open innovation, they do not have the same values. For the shanzhai, open innovation means total deregulation and a kind of coopetition that poorly masks fierce competition. For the makers, open innovation does not entirely eliminate the classic tension between 'open' and 'closed' commons in the world of makers. These two communities still rarely collaborate.","1086":"The application of White Rabbit precision time protocol (WR-PTP) in long-distance optical fiber links has been investigated. WR-PTP is an implementation of PTP in synchronous Ethernet optical fiber networks, originally intended for synchronization of equipment within a range of 10 km. This paper discusses the results and limitations of two implementations of WR-PTP in the existing communication fiber networks. A 950-km WR-PTP link was realized using unidirectional paths in a fiber pair between Espoo and Kajaani, Finland. The time transfer on this link was compared (after initial calibration) against a clock comparison by GPS precise point positioning (PPP). The agreement between the two methods remained within +\/- 2 ns over three months of measurements. Another WR-PTP implementation was realized between Delft and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, by cascading two links of 137 km each. In this case, the WR links were realized as bidirectional paths in single fibers. The measured time offset between the starting and end points of the link was within 5 ns with an uncertainty of 8 ns, mainly due to the estimated delay asymmetry caused by chromatic dispersion.","1091":"The need for automated analyzers for industrial and environmental samples has triggered the research for new and cost-effective strategies of automation and control of analytical systems. The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1.","1094":["Purpose - The number of 3D models available on the internet to both students and educators is rapidly expanding. Not only are the 3D model collections of popular websites like Thingiverse. com growing, organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution and NASA have also recently begun to build collections of 3D models and make these openly accessible online. Yet, even with increased interest in 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies, little is known about the overall structure of the 3D models available on the internet. The paper aims to discuss this issue.","Design\/methodology\/approach - To initiate this project, a list was built of 33 of the most widely used 3Dmodel websites on the internet. Freely downloadablemodels, as well as models available for purchase or as 3D printed objects were included in the list. Once the list of 33 websites was created, the data for each individual 3D model in the collections was manually assembled and recorded. The titles of the 3D models, keywords, subject headings, license information, and number of views and downloads were recorded, as this information was available. The data were gathered between January and May 2015, and compiled into a CSV database. To determine how online 3D model content relates to a variety of educational disciplines, relevant subject terms for a variety of educational disciples were extracted from the EBSCO database system. With this list of subject terms in hand, the keywords in the CSV database of model information were searched for each of the subject terms, with an automated process using a Perl script.","Findings - There have been many teachers, professors, librarians and students who have purchased 3D printers with little or no 3D modelling skills. Without these skills the owners of these 3D printers are entirely reliant on the content created and freely shared by others to make use of their 3D printers. As the data collected for this research paper shows, the vast majority of open 3D model content available online pertains to the professions already well versed in 3D modelling and Computer Aided Design design, such as engineering and architecture.","Originality\/value - Despite that fact that librarians, teachers and other educators are increasingly using technologies that rely on open 3D model content as educational tools, no research has yet been done to assess the number of 3D models available online and what educational disciplines this content relates to. This paper attempts to fill this gap, providing an overview of the size of this content, the educational disciplines this content relates to and who has so far been responsible for developing this content. This information will be valuable to librarians and teachers currently working with technology such as 3D printers and virtual reality, as well as those considering investing in this technology."],"1095":"The widespread diffusion of sensors, mobile devices, social media and open data are reconfiguring the way data underpinning policy and science are being produced and consumed. This in turn is creating both opportunities and challenges for policy-making and science. There can be major benefits from the deployment of the IoT in smart cities and environmental monitoring, but to realize such benefits, and reduce potential risks, there is an urgent need to address current limitations, including the interoperability of sensors, data quality, security of access and new methods for spatio-temporal analysis. Within this context, the manuscript provides an overview of the AirSensEUR project, which establishes an affordable open software\/hardware multi-sensor platform, which is nonetheless able to monitor air pollution at low concentration levels. AirSensEUR is described from the perspective of interoperable data management with emphasis on possible use case scenarios, where reliable and timely air quality data would be essential.","1100":["The Navy will be building new classes of surface combatants. The platform mission sets will change significantly throughout their lives. Between design, production of the lead ships, and production of ship classes, the decisions made during the design phase will impact the Navy for as long as the next 70 years. The Navy is applying modular and Open Systems Architecture (OSA)[1] strategy that promotes innovation, fair competition, risk reduction, and the rapid incorporation of prototypes and upgrades for new capabilities to address evolving warfighter needs. Given the expense of acquisition programs-coupled with budget limitations stemming from a fiscally constrained environment-it is time for a refined look at the Naval acquisition strategy. This paper will describe how the Navy is shifting its efforts toward decoupling the ship platform design to allow for flexible and rapid integration of evolving mission systems through open platform architectures.[2] In addition, OSA will be applied to the mission systems as well to support incremental and rapid upgrades to those payloads throughout their lifecycle. Lastly, this paper will touch upon the clash in product lifecycles between the ship platform and the mission systems payloads and will emphasize the need to look at these products through different lenses.","This paper will describe a product-line concept that can establish reusability of warfighting capability across platform types while also bringing third parties and non-traditional suppliers[3] to the marketplace for adding new performance features.

However, rapid capability reuse and deployment across many systems can achieve significant cost, schedule, and warfighting advantages."],"1115":"Communication networks these days face a relentless increase in traffic load. Multi-gigabit-per-second links are becoming widespread, and network devices are under continuous stress, so testing whether they guarantee the specified throughput or delay is a must. Software-based solutions, such as packet-train traffic injection, were adequate for lower speeds, but they have become inaccurate in the current scenario. Hardware-based solutions have proved to be very accurate, but usually at the expense of much higher development and acquisition costs. Fortunately, new affordable FPGA SoC devices, as well as high-level synthesis tools, can very efficiently reduce these costs. In this article we show the advantages of hardware-based solutions in terms of accuracy, comparing the results obtained in an FPGA SoC development platform and in NetFPGA-10G to those of software. Results show that a hardware-based solution is significantly better, especially at 10 Gb\/s. By leveraging high-level synthesis and open source platforms, prototypes were quickly developed. Noticeable advantages of our proposal are high accuracy, competitive cost with respect to the software counterpart, which runs in high-end off-the-shelf workstations, and the capability to easily evolve to upcoming 40 Gb\/s and 100 Gb\/s networks.","1117":"Population aging and increasing pressure on health systems are two issues that demand solutions. Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.","1118":"The Internet is so omnipresent and pervasive that its form may seem an inevitability. It is hard to imagine a \"different\" Internet, but the character of the Internet as we experience it today is, in fact, contingent on key decisions made in the past by its designers, those who have invested in it, and those who have regulated it. With different choices, we might have a very different Internet today. This paper uses past choices made during the emergence of the early Internet as a lens to look toward its future, which is equally contingent on decisions being made today: by industry, by governments, by users, and by the research community. This paper identifies some of those key choices, and discusses alternative futures for the Internet, including how open, how diverse, how funded, and how protective of the rights of its users it may be.","1119":"Monitoring the crop water status of high-value crops such as fruit trees is generally performed through periodic measurements of physiological indicators on leaves or fruits using sophisticated instruments and complex procedures. These measurements are very often difficult to translate into irrigation advice. Soil water potential (SWP), however, is a basic soil water status variable that is correlated with plant water uptake, and it can easily be measured using sensors. Soil water potential can provide useful support for irrigation scheduling at the field scale, thus enhancing water savings in agricultural areas. In this work, we present the results of an experimental study conducted in the 2014 agricultural season on a peach orchard located in Lodi (Northern Italy). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an irrigation scheduling based on continuous SWP measurements collected at two soil depths (-15 and -35 cm) on the crop water status and the peach production relative to the farmer's commonly adopted irrigation practice. To answer the question in the title, periodic measurements of physiological parameters such as leaf water potential, stomatal resistance (r(s)), transpiration (E), and crop water stress index were performed, along with monitoring of fruit size evolution and fruit sugar content at harvest. All of these variables were measured to assess the crop physiological state of the trees subjected to the two different irrigation treatments, with the final objective of determining whether the irrigation scheduling based on SWP measurements compromised the quality and quantity of produced peaches. Although obtained for only one agricultural season, the results showed that no considerably crop water stress occurred, even for the irrigation treatment based on SWP measurements. In particular, the most extreme values of leaf water potential, r(s), E, and crop water stress index measured at midday were -2 MPa, 45 s m(-1), 1.4 mm h(-1) and 0.5, respectively, which are in good agreement with those observed in many studies for well-watered orchards in Mediterranean areas. In conclusion, we can stress that SWP monitoring can be considered to be a reliable alternative to the more costly and time-consuming physiological measurements for the irrigation scheduling of fruit crops such as peach orchards. This approach provides continuous information about the soil water status, thereby preventing plant water stress and reducing irrigation water consumption at the farm scale.","1122":"The aim of this paper is to determine the physical proximity of connected things when they are accessed from a smartphone.

This work explores users as the primary factors to improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and energy efficiency. The results support the use of real-time monitoring systems in office buildings.

This paper addresses this problem by proposing a completely democratized optical network infrastructure. It introduces the novel concepts of the optical white box and bare metal optical switch as key technology enablers for democratizing optical networks. These are programmable optical switches whose hardware is loosely connected internally and is completely separated from their control software. To alleviate their complexity, a multi-dimensional abstraction mechanism using software-defined network technology is proposed. It creates a universal model of the proposed switches without exposing their technological details. It also enables a conventional network programmer to develop network applications for control of the optical network without specific technical knowledge of the physical layer. Furthermore, a novel optical network virtualization mechanism is proposed, enabling the composition and operation of multiple coexisting and application-specific virtual optical networks sharing the same physical infrastructure. Finally, the optical white box and the abstraction mechanism are experimentally evaluated, while the virtualization mechanism is evaluated with simulation.","1137":"This Article identifies a profound, ongoing shift in the modern administrative state: from the regulation of things to the regulation of code. This shift has and will continue to place previously isolated agencies in an increasing state of overlap, raising the likelihood of inconsistent regulations and putting seemingly disparate policy goals, like privacy, safety, environmental protection, and copyright enforcement, in tension. This Article explores this problem through a series of case studies and articulates a taxonomy of code regulations to help place hardware-turned-code rules in context. The Article considers the likely turf wars, regulatory thickets, and related dynamics that are likely to arise, and closes by considering the benefits of creating a new agency with some degree of centralized authority over software regulation issues.","1141":"Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and loT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudloT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudloT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudloT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudloT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms - both proprietary and open source - and projects implementing the CloudloT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The small fixed-wing UAV called Xiang Fei is developed independently by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The flight control system is designed based on an open-source autopilot (Pixhawk). Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS is introduced due to its high accuracy. Some modifications on the longitudinal and lateral guidance laws are achieved to improve the flight control performance. Moreover, a data fusion based fault-tolerant control scheme is integrated in altitude control and speed control for altitude sensor failure and airspeed sensor failure, which are the common problems for small fixed-wing UAV. Finally, the real flight experiments are implemented to test the fault-tolerant control based autopilot of UAV. Real flight test results are given and analyzed in detail, which show that the fixed-wing UAV can track the desired altitude and speed commands during the whole flight process including takeoff, climbing, cruising, gliding, landing, and wave-off by the fault-tolerant control based autopilot.","1151":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being used to facilitate monitoring of patients in hospital and home environments. These systems consist of a variety of different components\/sensors and many processes like clustering, routing, security, and self-organization. Routing is necessary for medical-based WSNs because it allows remote data delivery and it facilitates network scalability in large hospitals. However, routing entails several problems, mainly due to the open nature of wireless networks, and these need to be addressed. This paper looks at two of the problems that arise due to wireless routing between the nodes and access points of a medical WSN (for IoT use): black hole and selective forwarding (SF) attacks. A solution to the former can readily be provided through the use of cryptographic hashes, while the latter makes use of a neighbourhood watch and threshold-based analysis to detect and correct SF attacks. The scheme proposed here is capable of detecting a selective forwarding attack with over 96% accuracy and successfully identifying the malicious node with 83% accuracy.","1152":"The drift of inertial navigation system (INS) will lead to large navigation error when a low-cost INS is used in microaerial vehicles (MAV). To overcome the above problem, an INS\/optical flow\/magnetometer integrated navigation scheme is proposed for GPS-denied environment in this paper. The scheme, which is based on extended Kalman filter, combines INS and optical flow information to estimate the velocity and position of MAV. The gyro, accelerator, and magnetometer information are fused together to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is at static state or uniformly moving state; and the gyro only is used to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is accelerating or decelerating. The MAV flight data is used to verify the proposed integrated navigation scheme, and the verification results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the errors of navigation parameters and improve navigation precision.","1155":"Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and space over large spatio-temporal scales.

For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.","1157":"The article showcases a case study of Cloud Computing model combined with AT-Mega microcontrollers for educational purposes.

We improved the InMoov hand, enhancing dexterity by adding abduction\/adduction degrees of freedom of three fingers (thumb, index and middle fingers) and a three-degrees-of-freedom parallel spherical joint wrist. A systematic kinematic analysis is provided. The proposed robotic hand is validated in the framework of the PARLOMA project. PARLOMA aims at developing a telecommunication system for deaf-blind people, enabling remote transmission of signs from tactile Sign Languages. Both hardware and software are provided online to promote further improvements from the community.","1168":"This article explores the socio-environmental implications of two different value models currently competing for dominance in the digital economy: the neo-feudal cognitive capitalism (NFCC) and the hypothetical case of mature peer production (HMPP). Using a systematisation that considers environmental effects of information and communication technologies as direct, indirect and structural, this article discerns the future socio-environmental scenarios indicative of each value model. We argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. Likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the NFCC is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the HMPP is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons. Hence, the latter is considered as the socio-environmentally auspicious choice, but comes not without transitional challenges of its own. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides an open source design for a laser polymer welding system, which can be fabricated with low-cost fused filament fabrication and off-the-shelf mechanical and electrical parts. The system is controlled with free and open source software and firmware. The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems. The application of these parameter sets provides users of the open source laser polymer welder with the fundamental requirements to produce mechanically stable LLDPE multi-layer welded products, such as heat exchangers.","1172":"Microfluidics is still a fast growing field and an interesting market, which increasingly demands sophisticated equipment and specific engineering solutions. Aside from the widely discussed chip technology, the external equipment and machinery to operate such a microfluidic chip system comes into focus. A number of companies offer solutions to pursue the various requests made by the microfluidic community. Commercially available systems for pumping fluids are versatile but also highly expensive. Here, we present a fully-programmable pressure source, which is low-cost and can be utilized for pressure-controlled fluid driving, destructive bonding tests, and other pressure-relevant experiments. We evaluated our setup and compared the performance to a commercially available system. Furthermore, we demonstrated the use of the system in the field of droplet microfluidics as a possible application. Our development aims to lower the entrance threshold for microfluidic technology and make it more accessible to a broader audience.","1176":"The Internet of Things (IoT), often referred as the future Internet; is a collection of interconnected devices integrated into the world-wide network that covers almost everything and could be available anywhere. IoT is an emerging technology and aims to play an important role in saving money, conserving energy, eliminating gap and better monitoring for intensive management on a routine basis. On the other hand, it is also facing certain design constraints such as technical challenges, social challenges, compromising privacy and performance tradeoffs. This paper surveys major technical limitations that are hindering the successful deployment of the IoT such as standardization, interoperability, networking issues, addressing and sensing issues, power and storage restrictions, privacy and security, etc. This paper categorizes the existing research on the technical constraints that have been published in the recent years. With this categorization, we aim to provide an easy and concise view of the technical aspects of the IoT. Furthermore, we forecast the changes influenced by the IoT. This paper predicts the future and provides an estimation of the world in year 2020 and beyond.","1177":"Nearly every practical improvement in modeling human motion is well founded in a properly designed collection of data or datasets. These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The proposal includes problems associated with the area of mobile robotics, in which the student develops artificial intelligence solutions to optimize the movement of a robot in an unknown environment, avoiding obstacles. The proposed method was applied during three semesters (2012.1, 2013.1, and 2013.2), in the Applied Artificial Intelligence course of the Computational Engineering programme at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. The results obtained in opinion surveys with the students during the three semesters are presented with the aim of validating the PBL proposal. The responses obtained in the opinion surveys show that the proposed method was well received, given that more than 80% of the responses were positive.

These new tools and technologies lower the design costs, but also allow rapid creation of fully functional components. This paper describes the FDM and 3DP rapid prototyping technologies that were used to create elements and tools in the wood industry field. Total costs of manufacturing related to the fabrication of sample elements and tools are analysed. One of the main recognised issues of wider application of rapid prototyping technologies is their still very high costs related to all production aspects, starting with a lack of available materials, material cost, up to high cost of available commercial equipment, usually focused only on specific solutions and limited range of materials. Generally, AM costs can be divided into the group of fixed costs and variable ones. This paper deals with the optimization of the production costs of fabricated elements in case of small-scale production, and optimization of variable costs (processing and post-processing, costs of enforcement, and material costs).","1182":"Developing self-organised swarm systems capable of adapting to environmental changes as well as to dynamic situations is a complex challenge. An efficient labour division model, with the ability to regulate the distribution of work among swarm robots, is an important element of this kind of system. This paper extends the popular response threshold model and proposes a new adaptive response threshold model (ARTM). Experiments were carried out in simulation and in real-robot scenarios with the aim of studying the performance of this new adaptive model. Results presented in this paper verify that the extended approach improves on the adaptability of previous systems. For example, by reducing collision duration among robots in foraging missions, our approach helps small swarms of robots to adapt more efficiently to changing environments, thus increasing their self-sustainability (survival rate). Finally, we propose a minimal version of ARTM, which is derived from the conclusions drawn through real-robot and simulation results.","1183":"Free software development and the technological practices of hackers have been broadly recognised as fundamental for the formation of political cultures that foster democracy in the digital mediascape. This article explores the role of free software in the practices of digital artists, animators and technicians who work in various roles for the contemporary digital visual media industries. Rather than discussing it as a model of organising work, the study conceives free software as a production tool and shows how it becomes a locus of politics about finding material security in flexible capitalism. This politics is ultimately contradictory in that it extends creative and craft autonomy of digital artists but does not mobilise a critical project. Instead, it nurtures further precarious labour. Empirically, the article draws on ethnographically collected material from the media practices of digital artists and programmers who engage with two popular free software production tools, Blender and Synfig.","1186":"Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is increasingly used to investigate biological processes in animals as well as in plants. LSFM achieves optical sectioning by the selective illumination of a single plane of the sample with a sheet of laser light while simultaneously recording emitted fluorescence orthogonally to the illumination plane. A 3D image of the sample can then be generated with a temporal resolution ranging from seconds to several days, and at scales ranging from subcellular to whole organ. By design, LSFM provides fast imaging, and low phototoxicity, two key criteria for live imaging under physiological conditions. Despite its potential, LSFM remains underutilized in plant biology. This review aims to highlight challenges of live imaging in plants, to describe key steps in using LSFM on live plant samples and finally at providing an overview of published examples of applications of LSFM in plants.","1187":"Popular portraits of hacking have often relied on histories of hobbyist engineering culture rooted in tales of middle-class, college-educated, and often male technologists. Since 2012, members of a mother-operated hackerspace in the East Bay of San Francisco, California, have countered these narratives, revealing hackerspaces as sites with which to refigure masculine claims to innovation and progress. Drawing on critical craft studies and studies of therapeutic culture, this article examines the workings of Mothership HackerMoms and its series of workshops called Failure Club, a project motivated by a desire to support women's creative pursuits with the onset of motherhood. By integrating feminist legacies of craftwork with the centrality of failure exposing personal failures and failures to transform hacker cultures members not only energize new modes of hacking activity but also hack the very ontology of hacking.","1189":"Biological processes are inherently multi-scale, and supramolecular complexes at the nanoscale determine changes at the cellular scale and beyond. Single-molecule localizationmicroscopy (SMLM)(1-3) techniques have been established as important tools for studying cellular features with resolutions of the order of around 10 nm. However, in their current form these modalities are limited by a highly constrained field of view (FOV) and field-dependent image resolution. Here, we develop a low-cost microlens array (MLA)-based epi-illumination system-flat illumination for field-independent imaging (FIFI)-that can efficiently and homogeneously perform simultaneous imaging of multiple cells with nanoscale resolution. The optical principle of FIFI, which is an extension of the Kohler integrator, is further elucidated and modelled with a new, free simulation package. We demonstrate FIFI's capabilities by imaging multiple COS-7 and bacteria cells in 100 x 100 mu m(2) SMLM images-more than quadrupling the size of a typical FOV and producing near-gigapixel-sized images of uniformly high quality.","1194":"Industrial control systems have traditionally been built around dedicated wired solutions. The requirements of flexibility, mobility, and cost have created a strong push toward wireless solutions, preferably solutions requiring low power. Simultaneously, the increased need for interoperability and integration with the wider Internet made a transition to IP-based communication unavoidable. Following these trends, we survey 6TiSCH, the emerging family of standards for IP-based industrial communication over low-power and lossy networks. We describe the state of the standardization work, the major issues being discussed, and open questions recently identified. Based on extensive first-hand experience, we discuss challenges in implementation of this new wave of standards. Lessons learned are highlighted from four popular open-source implementations of these standards: OpenWSN, Contiki, RIOT, and TinyOS. We outline major requirements, present insights from early interoperability testing and performance evaluations, and provide guidelines for chip manufacturers and implementers.","1196":null,"1199":"We propose an adaptive image-based visual servoing controller for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is based on a virtual camera.

Experimental results demonstrate controller performance.","1203":["Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously.","Design\/methodology\/approach - This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited.","Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.","Originality\/value - The methodology of the intelligent robot design for highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed."],"1206":"One of the main challenges for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs) is to extend the endurance of small vehicles such as multi-rotors. Actually, Li-po batteries that guarantee a flight of about 20 min power this type of vehicles. The endurance can be extended by enabling vehicles to look for recharging station(s). In this paper, we propose a vision system able to detect and track a given pattern hosted on the target-landing platform. The pattern is also useful to estimate the UAV position while approaching the target or during the hovering close to the target. The paper focuses on an optimized adaptive thresholding technique that manages critical situations as changes in the scene's illumination \/ shadows. The developed system runs at 90 Hz for processing a 752x480 grayscale image. Preliminary results on an NVidia Tegra Jetson K1 platform are also presented to distribute the computation between CPU and GPU.","1207":"Robotics technology and the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence are breakthrough innovations with significant growth prospects. They have the potential to disrupt existing socio-economic facets of everyday life. Yet few studies have analysed the development of robotics innovation. This paper closes this gap by analysing current developments in innovation in robotics; how it is diffused, and what role is played by intellectual property (IP). The paper argues that robotics clusters are mainly located in the US and Europe, despite a growing presence in South Korea and China. The robotics innovation ecosystem builds on cooperative networks of actors, including individuals, research institutions, and firms. Governments play a significant role in supporting robotics innovation through funding, military demand, and national robotics strategies. Robotics competitions and prizes provide an important incentive for innovation. Patents are used to exclude third parties to secure freedom of operation, license technologies, and avoid litigation. The countries with the highest number of patent claims arc Japan, China, South Korea, and the US. The growing stock of patents owned by universities and PROs, particularly in China, is noteworthy too. Automotive and electronics companies are still the largest patent filers, but medical technologies and the Internet are emerging as new actors in the field. Secrecy is often used as a tool to appropriate innovation. Copyright protection is relevant to robotics also, mainly for its role in protecting software. Finally, open-source robotics platforms are increasingly used in the early stages of the innovation process as they allow new actors in the robotics field to optimize their initial spending on innovation.","1210":"When discussing maker culture, much attention is dedicated to how making can be beneficial for specific fields (e.g. healthcare, education) or various communities of makers (e.g. educators, crafters). The democratic ideal of personal fabrication and the maker culture movement - represented by the growth of open makerspaces (e.g. FabLabs, makerspaces) and online communities (e.g. 'Instructables', 'Thingiverse') worldwide - provides everyone with the opportunity to make (almost) anything. However, structurally engaging non-expert users still remains an important challenge for most open makerspaces. Therefore, this article focuses on the potential of open makerspaces for communities and - more specifically - how to involve nonexpert users in these open makerspaces. Framed within the fields of Participatory Design and infrastructuring, this article presents two case studies ` Hack-a-thing' and 'Making Things' - that are part of a long-term participation process of engaging local non-expert users in FabLab Genk. In these cases, the involved non-expert users entailed teenagers, children and their supervisors (for instance, supervisors involved in participating youth organisations). The case studies show that building relations with existing communities of non-expert users and creating conditions for them to self-organise their activities within open makerspaces are essential starting points for processes of long-term engagement.","1214":"Twitter's hashtag functionality is now used for a very wide variety of purposes, from covering crises and other breaking news events through gathering an instant community around shared media texts (such as sporting events and TV broadcasts) to signalling emotive states from amusement to despair. These divergent uses of the hashtag are increasingly recognised in the literature, with attention paid especially to the ability for hashtags to facilitate the creation of ad hoc or hashtag publics. A more comprehensive understanding of these different uses of hashtags has yet to be developed, however. Previous research has explored the potential for a systematic analysis of the quantitative metrics that could be generated from processing a series of hashtag datasets. Such research found, for example, that crisis-related hashtags exhibited a significantly larger incidence of retweets and tweets containing URLs than hashtags relating to televised events, and on this basis hypothesised that the information-seeking and -sharing behaviours of Twitter users in such different contexts were substantially divergent. This article updates such study and their methodology by examining the communicative metrics of a considerably larger and more diverse number of hashtag datasets, compiled over the past five years. This provides an opportunity both to confirm earlier findings, as well as to explore whether hashtag use practices may have shifted subsequently as Twitter's userbase has developed further; it also enables the identification of further hashtag types beyond the \"crisis\" and \"mainstream media event\" types outlined to date. The article also explores the presence of such patterns beyond recognised hashtags, by incorporating an analysis of a number of keyword-based datasets. This large-scale, comparative approach contributes towards the establishment of a more comprehensive typology of hashtags and their publics, and the metrics it describes will also be able to be used to classify new hashtags emerging in the future. In turn, this may enable researchers to develop systems for automatically distinguishing newly trending topics into a number of event types, which may be useful for example for the automatic detection of acute crises and other breaking news events.","1215":"Most widely used instruction set architectures (ISAs) are proprietary, while much software innovation is facilitated by being open. Might hardware innovation also be accelerated by ISAs being open? This article examines this question with an edited transcript of a debate from the 4th workshop on computer architecture research directions.","1218":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the experiential learning of electronics subject matter is effective in the middle school open learning of robotics. Electronics is often ignored in robotics courses. Since robotics courses are typically comprised of computer-related subjects, and mechanical and electrical engineering, these three areas should be emphasized equally. Many studies reveal impressive learning of computer science and mechanical engineering, but clear evidence of the effectiveness of electronics learning in the higher order thinking skills of middle school students is still lacking. We designed three different robotics courses with electronics subject matter introduced through experiential learning. A parallel group design was used, where three different open learning courses were implemented for middle school students. Based on results of the first and second implementations, we improved students' learning of relevant content for each successive step of the experiment. In total, 381 middle school students participated in all experiments and were surveyed using pre- and post-tests. The collected data were analyzed using a quantitative research methodology. The findings revealed that the teaching approach was effective. During the learning process, student interest in robotics increased, and overall achievement improved with a medium effect size (eta(2) = 0.13). The best results for the learning of electronics subject matter were found in the learning process (eta(2) = 0.44), where experimental sharing of electronics parts was the most evident approach used by the students. Examination of learning material structure in light of the shared electronics subject matter is analyzed and discussed and possible directions for future research are presented.","1219":"The objective of this work is to develop a framework that can deploy and provide coordination between multiple heterogeneous agents when a swarm robotic system adopts a decentralized approach; each robot evaluates its relative rank among the other robots in terms of travel distance and cost to the goal. Accordingly, robots are allocated to the sub-tasks for which they have the highest rank (utility). This paper provides an analysis of existing swarm control environments and proposes a software environment that facilitates a rapid deployment of multiple robotic agents. The framework (UBSwarm) exploits our utility-based task allocation algorithm. UBSwarm configures these robots and assigns the group of robots a particular task from a set of available tasks. Two major tasks have been introduced that show the performance of a robotic group. This robotic group is composed of heterogeneous agents. In the results, a premature example that has prior knowledge about the experiment shows whether or not the robots are able to accomplish the task.","1221":"Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters provides farmers with useful information, which can improve the quality and productivity of crops grown in greenhouses. The objective of this study was to develop a greenhouse environment measurement system using a low-cost microcontroller with open-source software. Greenhouse environment parameters measured were air temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The ranges of the temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration were -40 to 120 degrees C, 0 to 100%, and 0 to 10,000 ppm, respectively. A 128 x 64 graphic LCD display was used for real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environments. An Arduino Uno R3 consisted of a USB interface for communicating with a computer, 6 analog inputs, and 14 digital input\/output pins. A temperature\/relative humidity sensor was connected to digital pins 2 and 3. A CO2 sensor was connected to digital pins 12 and 13. The LCD was connected to digital pin 1 (TX). The sketches were programmed with the Arduino Software (IDE). A measurement system including the Arduino board, sensors, and accessories was developed (totaling $244). Data for the environmental parameters in a venlo-type greenhouse were obtained using this system without any problems. We expect that the low-cost microcontroller using open-source software can be used for monitoring the environments of plastic greenhouses in Korea.","1222":"Optical approaches for hydrophone calibrations offer significant advantages over existing methods based on reciprocity. In particular, heterodyne and homodyne interferometry can accurately measure particle velocity and displacements at a specific point in space thus enabling the acoustical pressure to be measured in an absolute, direct, assumption-free manner, with traceability through the SI definition of the metre. The calibration of a hydrophone can then be performed by placing the active element of the sensor at the point where the acoustic pressure field was measured and monitoring its electrical output. However, it is crucial to validate the performance and accuracy of such optical methods by direct comparison rather than through device calibration. Here we report on the direct comparison of two such optical interferometers used in underwater acoustics and ultrasonics in terms of acoustic pressure estimation and their associated uncertainties in the frequency range 200 kHz-3.5 MHz, with results showing agreement better than 1% in terms of pressure and typical expanded uncertainties better than 3% for both reported methods.","1224":"An air quality monitoring system (AQMS) based on the IEEE\/ISO\/IEC 21451 standards is presented. In the development of an AQMS, we have used the GSM wireless communication module. The developed system is capable of the real-time measurement of air polluted gases, such as CO2, CO, NO2, and SO2. The machine-to-machine communication of the air quality monitoring station and PC with the sink node was successfully implemented. Various gas sensor technologies were evaluated for the system and ultimately electrochemical and infrared sensors were used. Hardware and software for an AQMS was designed and implemented. The AQMS uses an array of sensors to take the measurements of the ambient air surrounding it and wirelessly transmits the data to the base station. A graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy for end user(s) to interact with the system, was developed. Gas concentration values are plotted on the GUI. The defined calibration of the instruments at time interims assures that the desired accuracy is sustained. This paper offers further elucidations to design disputes raised in earlier studies.","1226":"Globally, analog television platforms are in steady decline, while digital platforms proliferate. This shift has considerable socio-economic and cultural implications that are too often ignored by the existing economic and political economy literatures. This article surveys key patterns in the adoption of digital platforms across Europe, and finds, based on an array of quantitative metrics, apparently contradictory trends. We observe, on one hand, the rise of closed TV platforms as the paradigmatic commercial model of the new media landscape; but on the other, the cultural and material openness of the Internet, which is radically transforming the consumption of television. While hybrid arrangements abound, industry solutions are still awkwardly matched to consumer preferences. Without drawing too sharp a line between technology and culture, the article presents an overview of the many ways the changing meaning of digital platforms continues to shape the global television industry.

The proposed method relies strictly on onboard sensors of employed MAVs and does not require any external positioning system. The core of the method consists in extraction of information from pictures consequently captured using a camera carried by the particular MAV. Visual features are obtained from images of the surface under the MAV, and stored into a map that is represented by these features. The position of the MAV is then obtained through matching with previously stored features. An important part of the proposed system is a novel approach for exploration and mapping of the workspace of robots. This method enables efficient exploring of the unknown environment, while keeping the iteratively built map of features consistent. The proposed algorithm is suitable for mapping of surfaces, both outdoor and indoor, with various density of the image features. The sufficient precision and long term persistence of the method allows its utilization for stabilization of large MAV groups that work in formations with small relative distances between particular vehicles. Numerous experiments with quadrotor helicopters and various numerical simulations have been realized for verification of the entire system and its components.","1229":"In this paper, we describe the design considerations and implementation of a smart toy system, a technology for supporting the automatic recording and analysis for detecting developmental delays recognition when children play using the smart toy. To achieve this goal, we take advantage of the current commercial sensor features (reliability, low consumption, easy integration, etc.) to develop a series of sensor-based low-cost devices. Specifically, our prototype system consists of a tower of cubes augmented with wireless sensing capabilities and a mobile computing platform that collect the information sent from the cubes allowing the later analysis by childhood development professionals in order to verify a normal behaviour or to detect a potential disorder. This paper presents the requirements of the toy and discusses our choices in toy design, technology used, selected sensors, process to gather data from the sensors and generate information that will help in the decision-making and communication of the information to the collector system. In addition, we also describe the play activities the system supports.","1234":"Do-it-yourself biology, or garage biology, is a set of practices through which lay people can practice biotechnology and thus also challenge the exclusive control exercised on biotech R&D by Big Bio. This article describes how garage biologists aim to radically transform biotechnological socio-material products and indicate a way of engaging with science and technology that is praxis oriented and builds on sharing, participation, and creativity. We argue that these do-it-yourself biology practices contain significant epistemological similarities with the well-established tradition of action research and indicate that both practices share the political objective to empower individuals to actively build their own future but that they prioritize different strategies. Action research investigates opportunities for empowerment in typical social domains while do-it-yourself biology focuses on the material dimension of socio-technical realities. By reviewing some do-it-yourself biology practices from the core basic principles of action research, the article aims to develop insight whether and in which forms a connectivity can be realized between these different practices leading to future collective actions among these practices.","1235":"This paper proposes an attitude estimation method based on optical flow to solve the attitude tracking control problem for a three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) lab helicopter. First, the relationship between optical flow and the motion of a general unmanned aerial vehicle is derived from the transformation between the image coordinate frame and the world coordinate frame. Then, an expression for the angular velocity of the 3-DOF helicopter is deduced only based on optical flow, and the attitude information is acquired by solving nonlinear equations. Finally, using visual feedback, a linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller is designed for hovering and tracking, which consists of a feedforward controller and a LQR state feedback controller. Closed-loop experimental results on the lab helicopter demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation and control methods.","1236":"Some earthquakes generate tsunamis in the ocean or coastal regions. An early alert is essential for the coastal population to prevent loss of human life. The propagation of the alert is made through a range of communication means: radio, television, sirens, landlines and cell phones, social media including Twitter, and, if electrical power and communications utilities are blacked-out, through an alternative opportunistic network. In this article, a special device, named Witness Unit (WU), designed to work with a satellite network is presented as an alternative communications means in a temporarily degraded disaster environment. A greedy heuristic algorithm for the placement and deployment of the WUs is introduced and its interaction with emergency managers and citizens is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The general approach relies on technological determinism, whereby the discussion revolves around how and to what extent will ICT support development. It assumes the benefits of ICT as inherent. This approach ignores that ICT is created and experienced within a socially divisive and complex space. A more critical and sociological analysis is needed for development studies to better understand the implications of ICT initiatives. In this article, I argue that Saskia Sassen's analytical framework of technology and society as embedded avoids this technological determinism and allows social theorists to account for social and material aspects of ICT. To support this alternative framework, I present a case study of a rural ICT initiative in Gujarat, India, and discuss how this re-conceptualization reveals more nuanced understanding of ICT and society. Based on interviews and field research, I find that technology creates new social understandings for the rural ICT users, but also that society shapes the technology to make it inaccessible for them.","1240":"A soft condensed matter sensor (SCMS) designed to measure strains on the human body is presented. The hybrid material based on carbon black (CB) and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was bonded to a textile elastic band and used as a sensor on the human wrist to measure hand motion by detecting the movement of tendons in the wrist. Additionally it was able to track the blood pulse wave of a person, allowing for the determination of pulse wave peaks corresponding to the systole and diastole blood pressures in order to calculate the heart rate. Sensor characterization was done using mechanical cycle testing, and the band sensor achieved a gauge factor of 4-6.3 while displaying low signal relaxation when held at a strain levels. Near-linear signal performance was displayed when loading to successively higher strain levels up to 50% strain.","1241":null,"1244":"The research area of the compressed baryonic matter - CBM experiment (FAIR\/GSI in Darmstadt) is sub-nuclear physics, thus hadron-baryon and quark-gluon, and the essence of phase transitions in the area of hot nuclear matter, and dense strongly interacting matter.

Indoor channel measurements at the 2.4-GHz ISM frequency band have been conducted using a versatile channel sounder test-bed platform. A single transmitting antenna, four receiving antennas with two proposed geometries and a four-branch receiver circuitry were used in order to achieve channel sounder measurements exploiting baseband signal-processing techniques. In-depth investigation of SIMO wireless channel performance was realised through three types of metrics: signal strength, gain coefficient and capacity. Performance results indicate SIMO channel capacity enhancement and illustrate differences between the two proposed geometries.","1251":"Open source communities rely on the espoused premise of complete openness and transparency of source code and development process. Yet, openness and transparency at times need to be balanced out with moments of less open and transparent work. Through our detailed study of Linux Kernel development, we build a theory that explains that transparency and openness are nuanced and changing qualities that certain developers manage as they use multiple digital technologies and create, in moments of needs, more opaque and closed digital spaces of work. We refer to these spaces as digital folds. Our paper contributes to the extant literature by providing a process theory of how transparency and openness are balanced with opacity and closure in open source communities according to the needs of the development work; by conceptualizing the nature of digital folds and their role in providing quiet spaces of work; and, by articulating how the process of digital folding and unfolding is made far more possible by select elite actors' navigating the line between the pragmatics of coding and the accepted ideology of openness and transparency.","1252":"This work presents the City Dynamics and Smart Environment activities of the Smart Ring project, a model for the smart city, based on the integration of sustainable urban transport services and environmental monitoring over a 4-5-km circular path, the Smart Ring, around the historical center of l'Aquila (Italy). We describe our pilot experience performed during an experimental on-demand public service electric bus, SmartBus, which was equipped with a multi-parametric air quality low-cost gas electrochemical sensor platform, NASUS IV. For five days (28-29 August 2014 and 1-3 September 2014), the sensor platform was installed inside the SmartBus and measured air quality gas compounds (nitrogen dioxide, carbon oxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) during the service. Data were collected and analyzed on the bases of an air quality index, which provided qualitative insights on the air status potentially experienced by the users. The results obtained are in agreement with the synoptic meteorological conditions, the urban background air quality reference measurements and the potential traffic flow variations. Furthermore, they indicated that the air quality status was influenced by the gas component NO and CO. We discuss the features of our campaign, and we highlight the potential, limitations and key factors to consider for future project designs.","1255":"The holy grail of smart cities is an integrated, sustainable approach to improve the efficiency of the city's operations and the quality of life of citizens. At the heart of this vision is the citizen, who is the primary beneficiary of smart city initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six citizen-related challenges: the engagement of citizens, the improvement of citizens' data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services, and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a way of transferring insights and solutions from GIScience to smart cities.","1257":"This paper addresses a new method for combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). Applying supervised learning in robot navigation encounters serious challenges such as inconsistent and noisy data, difficulty for gathering training data, and high error in training data. RL capabilities such as training only by one evaluation scalar signal, and high degree of exploration have encouraged researchers to use RL in robot navigation problem. However, RL algorithms are time consuming as well as suffer from high failure rate in the training phase. Here, we propose Supervised Fuzzy Sarsa Learning (SFSL) as a novel idea for utilizing advantages of both supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms. A zero order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller with some candidate actions for each rule is considered as the main module of robot's controller. The aim of training is to find the best action for each fuzzy rule. In the first step, a human supervisor drives an E-puck robot within the environment and the training data are gathered. In the second step as a hard tuning, the training data are used for initializing the value (worth) of each candidate action in the fuzzy rules. Afterwards, the fuzzy Sarsa learning module, as a critic-only based fuzzy reinforcement learner, fine tunes the parameters of conclusion parts of the fuzzy controller online. The proposed algorithm is used for driving E-puck robot in the environment with obstacles. The experiment results show that the proposed approach decreases the learning time and the number of failures; also it improves the quality of the robot's motion in the testing environments.

This paper focuses on a flight-test evaluation of navigation information in wide-field optical flow, using flight data collected by a wide-angle camera installed on a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle at altitudes ranging from 30 to 183m above the ground. A comprehensive evaluation methodology is proposed for the comparison between optical flows computed from videos and the reference motion fields determined from conventional navigation sensors including GPS, a laser range finder, and inertial sensors. Seven sets of unmanned aerial vehicle flight data including a total of approximately 72,000 image frames are used for both full-flight temporal evaluation and representative interframe spatial evaluation of wide-field optical flow information for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation purposes. The evaluation results showed a good match between vision-derived optical flows and reference motion fields from conventional navigation sensors. Finally, one benchmark data set is shared at the authors' website for open access from the research community.","1260":"Energy consumption in battery operated mobile devices is a critical issue. Autonomy periods are increasingly compromised as the complexity of tasks, such as the widespread video decoding ones, is also increased. While new higher-capacity batteries are being developed, techniques to control, i.e. save, the energy consumption can provide a significant benefit. This paper presents the proposal, implementation and test of a real-time closed-loop control system applicable to the power-consumption regulation of multimedia mobile devices. The novel closed loop does not need any specific power sensor but only standard performance monitoring counters (PMCs) available in common mobile processors. From them, the power consumption is estimated with an algorithm to be included into the operating system, along with the control system itself. A theoretical system model has been first developed to (1) enable the design of some controllers and (2) validate the actual results obtained from the control system prototype into a given low-cost development board. These results prove the control-system stability and the comparative suitability of classic controllers to keep the multimedia-system consumption close to the desired value in steady state with settling times as short as a single sample interval(1).","1261":"Dense optical flow is a crucial visual cue for obstacle avoidance and motion control for robotic systems functioning in complex unstructured environments. In order to compute image motion for modern highly dynamic robots, it is necessary to use high speed vision systems. To perceive small and thin objects such as tree branches, fence poles, and other similar objects, high resolution vision systems must be used. The data stream from a high-resolution, high-speed vision system will saturate the onboard data bus and overload the onboard processor of almost all existing robotic systems. To implement such a vision system, we believe it is necessary to process the data in situ at the camera using dedicated processing hardware, a vision processing paradigm that we term rapid embedded vision (REV) systems. Even then, the task of processing multiple hundred hertz of dense high-resolution images is not possible using classical algorithms and classical computing hardware. A new processing paradigm that actively exploits the high frame rate of the image sequences, and high performance computing hardware such as GPU or FPGA must be employed. This letter proposes a filtering algorithm for the computation of dense optical flow fields in real time. The filter is designed as a pyramidal structure of update and propagation loops, where an optical flow state is constantly refined with new image data from the camera. The computational properties of the proposed algorithm makes it well suited for implementation in GPU and FPGA systems. We present results from a GPU implementation achieving frame rates in the order of 800 Hz at VGA resolution. Experimental validation and comparison is provided for both synthetic and real life high speed video sequences at frame rates of 300 Hz and 1016 x 544 pixel resolution.","1264":"This article develops the concept of \"smart velomobility\" that is concerned with networked practices, systems and technologies of cycling. The concept draws on velomobility, Smart Mobility\/Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Smart Cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). The article presents results from an empirical study, where 80 riders of a networked fleet of e-bikes discuss their experience of smart velomobility. The results show how digital and physical mobilities merge, the way riders of the networked fleet interact with the data, how they share the data and how they feel tracked (privacy). The conclusion sketches out future research of \"smart velomobilities\" and also points out the policy and innovation potential of cycling as active, sustainable and networked mode of transport in the context of Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.

Automated FLIM is implemented using wide-field time-gated detection, typically requiring only 10 s per field of view (FOV). Averaging over biological, thermal and shot noise with 100's to 1000's of FOV enables unbiased quantitative analysis with high statistical power. Plotting average donor lifetime vs. acceptor\/donor intensity ratio clearly identifies protein interactions and fitting to double exponential donor decay models provides estimates of interacting population fractions that, with calibrated donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities, can yield dissociation constants. We demonstrate the application to identify binding partners of MST1 kinase and estimate interaction strength among the members of the RASSF protein family, which have important roles in apoptosis via the Hippo signalling pathway. K-D values broadly agree with published biochemical measurements.","1268":"The growing popularity of wearable devices is leading to new ways to interact with the environment, with other smart devices, and with other people. Wearables equipped with an array of sensors are able to capture the owner's physiological and behavioural traits, thus are well suited for biometric authentication to control other devices or access digital services. However, wearable biometrics have substantial differences from traditional biometrics for computer systems, such as fingerprints, eye features, or voice. In this article, we discuss these differences and analyse how researchers are approaching the wearable biometrics field. We review and provide a categorization of wearable sensors useful for capturing biometric signals. We analyse the computational cost of the different signal processing techniques, an important practical factor in constrained devices such as wearables. Finally, we review and classify the most recent proposals in the field of wearable biometrics in terms of the structure of the biometric system proposed, their experimental setup, and their results. We also present a critique of experimental issues such as evaluation and feasibility aspects, and offer some final thoughts on research directions that need attention in future work.","1269":"Tabletop devices offer an attractive environment for the creation of hybrid board-games that seamlessly integrate physical and digital interaction. However, the prototyping of Tangible User Interfaces involves the integration of physical and virtual aspects, challenging both designers and developers, and hindering the rapid exploration of richer physical interactions with the game. Although the recent appearance of tabletop frameworks has helped to lower the threshold for coding tangible tabletop applications, the cost is a serious limitation on the degree of expressiveness of the tangible interaction. This paper presents \"ToyVision\", a software framework for the prototyping of tabletop games based on the manipulation of conventional playing pieces. ToyVision architecture is based on a Widget layer of abstraction that is able to express the manipulation of playing pieces in the context of the game. This Widget layer supports a wide range of passive and active manipulations with conventional objects. Designers and developers can visually model all passive and active manipulations involved in their game concepts in a Graphic Assistant, and test them immediately in a tabletop device. The paper also describes a set of evaluation sessions which demonstrate that ToyVision has been effective in lowering the threshold of developing applications for tabletop devices, while being sufficiently expressive to give support to innovative concepts for hybrid games that fully explore the tangible feasibilities of conventional playing pieces.","1271":"Robots have been recently used as valuable therapeutic devices in numerous studies (especially with children with developmental needs), but their role as more general support for therapists is less well studied. However, as robots become better integrated in therapeutic environments, they will also influence therapists; and if robots are designed correctly, they could positively influence therapists' well-being. Understanding how robots could be used in such a way is especially important as therapists of autistic children (and therapists of mentally disabled people in general) have one of the highest risks of workplace burnout. This paper describes a series of studies conducted to understand therapists' attitudes towards robotic support and to discover what is most needed in such devices; this paper also describes an experimental study of the feasibility of robots playing one of those roles. Through observational studies and a series of ten meetings, with a group of seven therapists of autism, a list of possible roles was created. In a larger questionnaire based study, therapists gave a ranking to various robot roles and functions (a child's behaviour analyser and support in critical\/dangerous situations were given the highest priority). Therapists also stated that they expect robots to help them in the workplace, help prepare documentation and make their work more systematic. In a Wizard-of-Oz type experimental study, a robot was used to play a role of \"emotional mirror\" with seven therapist-child pairs. Study participants stated that a robot was acceptable and was not disturbing, although most did not find it particularly useful. Our conclusions indicate that therapists want robots to play a larger role than just a therapeutic device, and such roles can be added to robots without disturbing sessions with clients.","1272":"Busca, B, Morales, J, Solana-Tramunt, M, Miro, A, and Garcia, M. Effects of jaw clenching while wearing a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece on strength in healthy young men. J Strength Cond Res 30(4): 1102-1110, 2016-Recent studies have investigated the ergogenic effects of different types of mouthguards. There is evidence of the benefits of clenching customized mouthpieces on force and power development. The phenomenon called concurrent activation potentiation (CAP) promoted in jaw clenching seems to enhance the muscular strength and power in maximal isometric contractions and powerful actions in sport. Moreover, a bite-aligning mouthpiece may promote a more aligned and powerful clench. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of jaw clenching while wearing a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece (MP) on jump ability and isometric maximal strength tests in contrast to 2 other conditions: nonjaw clenching (NON-JAW) and jaw clenching without the mouthpiece (JAW). A within-subjects design was used to assess the jump performance and the maximal isometric force in 28 physically active male subjects. Statistical analyses revealed significantly higher performance in JAW and NON-JAW conditions for handgrip force (HG-peakforce) and all variables of the back-row exercise (BRW) and countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) (p <= 0.05). Significant differences between NON-JAW and JAW were found for HG-peakforce (p <= 0.05). These findings suggest that it is advisable to use a customized bite-aligning mouthpiece to improve strength and power performance.","1275":"The Controller Area Network (CAN) has become a de-facto communication protocol in automation systems over the last three decades. Some CAN networks now employ TDMA-based communication in order to help meet real-time constraints. Whilst this form of media access control brings several timeliness benefits, studies have also illustrated negative effects on transmission reliability; duplicated message instances can help to increase this reliability. In this paper a transmission window technique for CAN is proposed. A bounded amount of re-transmission is allowed for each message within this window, which can in many cases provides increased reliability in the presence of errors or bursts of errors. A probabilistic analysis of transmission windows is presented and used to develop a simple algorithm for calculating the optimal window size to achieve a specified statistical guarantee of message delivery. Stochastic simulations along with computational and empirical results are presented which validate the analysis, and indicate that in many circumstances the technique can potentially reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for specified reliability levels when compared to the use of message duplicates. Suggestions are also made to help increase the reliability of message duplications in error burst environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The minimalistic OF sensor was robust to high-dynamic-range lighting conditions and to various visual patterns encountered thanks to its M(2)APIX auto-adaptive pixels and the new cross-correlation OF algorithm implemented. The low-cost car-like robot estimated its velocity and steering angle, and therefore its position and orientation, via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) using only two downward-facing OF sensors and the Ackerman steering model. Indoor and outdoor experiments were carried out in which the robot was driven in the closed-loop mode based on the velocity and steering angle estimates. The experimental results obtained show that our novel OF sensor can deliver high-frequency measurements (>300 Hz) in a wide OF range (1.5-15 rad s(-1)) and in a 7-decade high-dynamic light level range. The OF resolution was constant and could be adjusted as required (up to 0.05 rad s(-1)), and the OF precision obtained was relatively high (standard deviation of 0.17 rad s(-1) with an average OF of 4.5 rad s(-1), under the most demanding lighting conditions). An EKF-based algorithm gave the robot's position and orientation with a relatively high accuracy (maximum errors outdoors at a very low light level: 0.95 mand 0.58 rad over about 32 mand 8 pi rad) despite the low-resolution control systems of the steering servo and the DC motor, as well as a simplified model identification and calibration. Finally, the minimalistic OF-based odometry results were compared to those obtained using measurements based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a motor's speed sensor.","1281":"Objective: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are an emerging platform for targeted diagnostics in cancer. An important component needed for translation of MNPs is the detection and quantification of targeted MNPs bound to tumor cells. Method: This study explores the feasibility of a multifrequency nonlinear magnetic spectroscopic method that uses excitation and pickup coils and is capable of discriminating between quantities of bound and unbound MNPs in 0.5 ml samples of KB and Igrov human cancer cell lines. The method is tested over a range of five concentrations of MNPs from 0 to 80 mu g\/ml and five concentrations of cells from 50 to 400 000 count per ml. Results: A linear model applied to the magnetic spectroscopy data was able to simultaneously measure bound and unbound MNPs with agreement between the model-fit and lab assay measurements (p < 0.001). The detectable iron of the presented method to bound and unbound MNPs was < 2 mu g in a 0.5 ml sample. The linear model parameters used to determine the quantities of bound and unbound nanoparticles in KB cells were also used to measure the bound and unbound MNP in the Igrov cell line and vice versa. Conclusion: Nonlinear spectroscopic measurement of MNPs may be a useful method for studying targeted MNPs in oncology. Significance: Determining the quantity of bound and unbound MNP in an unknown sample using a linear model represents an exciting opportunity to translate multifrequency nonlinear spectroscopy methods to in vivo applications where MNPs could be targeted to cancer cells.","1282":"Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major threat to human health, but broad-spectrum antibiotics are losing efficacy. There is a need to screen a given drug against a bacterial infection outside of the laboratory. To address this need, we have designed and built an inexpensive and easy-to-use 3D-printer-based system that allows easily readable quantitative tests for the performance of antibacterial drugs. The platform creates a sterile diagnostic device by using 3D printing, and the device is filled automatically with growth medium, and then antibiotics are sprayed onto the medium by ink-jet technology. The sample for testing can be introduced via a fluid port, and the printer hot bed is used to incubate the device, allowing operation in the field. Combining advantages from various established tests of antibacterial performance, this allows the comparison of a specific antibiotics and bacteria. Also, this system can create and test several antibiotic formulations for therapeutic use, and we demonstrate this potential by investigating a mixture of pathogens that are only killed by a mixture of drugs.","1283":["Purpose - This paper aims to examine the dynamics of a community of practice (CoP) through a case study of eCars - Now! They offer open- source blueprints of the electric conversion kits globally. The authors analysed the CoP by considering its entire life cycle, starting from the motives for its establishment, through its active performance, up to the current stage, where the members need to decide whether the community will remain viable. Particular attention was paid to the group dynamics and issues that seemed relevant to the change in dynamics which determine whether a CoP maintains its vitality or dissipates.","Design\/methodology\/approach - The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy (Yin, 1984) to answer the research question and understand the target phenomenon of the CoP by analysing textual data. This particular case was chosen because of its unusual revelatory value for the case CoP which aims at creating a tangible innovation by using a platform that normally aims at intangible problem- solving (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). In the data collection, the authors used method and researcher triangulation (Patton, 1990).","Findings - Life cycle analysis revealed four themes that explained the change in the group dynamics and the dispersal of the community: differentiation and dispersal of interests, growth that resulted in role differentiation, virtuality in community development and inclusion of investors. The themes were all related to the fact that the case community operated with not only knowledge, but also with a tangible product. Therefore, the tangibility of a problem to be solved seems to play a pivotal role in a CoP's operations and dynamics and, in part, also explains the changing role of information and communications technology (ICT) in the process.","Research limitations\/implications - However, this paper identified also different ways to characterize community participation, which was also relevant from group dynamics point of view. Thus, the topic should be studied further. Group dynamics in general, as it relates to the success of CoPs, should be also investigated further. Additional studies should implement the inclusion of external resources in the community. Further research is also needed to investigate tangible and intangible outcomes achieved through CoPs. Much of the available research was conducted over short periods; prolonged interactions in a CoP context could show different results.","Practical implications - In conclusion, at the beginning of the life cycle of the eCars community, ICT played a significant role. It helped increase awareness of the community in the first place and enabled people to join in, which thus enabled the community to evolve. When the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became emphasized and much more important. In the maturing stage, the role of ICT, and especially social media, is the essential part of the community.","Social implications - This analysis suggests that at the early stage of a community, the plans can be somewhat random, even utopian, but when the community evolves, this uncertainty can become a problem. First, it affects achieving the actual, and in this case, concrete results. Second, uncertainty and unclarity dampen enthusiasm and motivation, which are of utmost importance due to the voluntary participation. This paper also concludes that when the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became increasingly important.","Originality\/value - This paper argues that the ideological basis for this kind of community should be openness. All information should be available for everyone who registers to the community platform on the internet. This community was working in the mindset of open innovation. Technical documentation and all other material were available for everyone in the community's wiki pages, which attracted a lot of people who were delighted by eCars. Many advisors delivered technical information and good advice to the practitioners of the community through the platform. The hang arounds were also very well-informed in this stage regarding how the core group was working."],"1284":"We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry. Here we describe the implementation and performance of the method on a hovering robot equipped with eight 0.65 g optic-flow sensors, and show that it can be used for closed-loop control of various motions.","1285":"The present work studies the effect of three insect-proof screens with different geometrical and aerodynamic characteristics on the air velocity and temperature inside a Mediterranean multi-span greenhouse with three roof vents and without crops, divided into two independent sectors. First, the insect-proof screens were characterised geometrically by analysing digital images and testing in a low velocity wind tunnel. The wind tunnel tests gave screen discharge coefficient values of C-d,C-phi of 0.207 for screen 1 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 35.0%), 0.151 for screen 2 (13 x 30 threads.cm(-2); phi = 26.3%) and 0.325 for screen 3 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 36.0%), at an air velocity of 0.25 m.s(-1). Secondly, when screens were installed in the greenhouse, we observed a statistical proportionality between the discharge coefficient at the openings and the air velocity u(i) measured in the centre of the greenhouse, u(i) = 0.856 C-d + 0.062 (R-2 = 0.68 and p-value = 0.012). The inside-outside temperature difference Delta T-io diminishes when the inside velocity increases following the statistically significant relationship Delta T-io = (-135.85 + 57.88\/u(i))(0.5) (R-2 = 0.85 and p-value = 0.0011). Different thread diameters and tension affects the screen thickness, and means that similar porosities may well be associated with very different aerodynamic characteristics. Screens must be characterised by a theoretical function C-d,C-phi = [(2e mu\/K-p rho).(1\/u(s)) + (2eY\/K(p)0.5)](-0.5) that relates the discharge coefficient of the screen C-d,C-phi with the air velocity us. This relationship depends on the three parameters that define the aerodynamic behaviour of porous medium: permeability K-p, inertial factor Y and screen thickness e (and on air temperature that determine its density rho and viscosity mu). However, for a determined temperature of air, the pressure drop-velocity relationship can be characterised only with two parameters: Delta P = au(s)(2) + bu(s).","1287":"Virtual platforms have become essential tools for the design of embedded systems. Developers rely on them for design space exploration and software debugging. However, with rising HW\/SW complexity and the need to simulate more and more processors simultaneously, the performance of virtual platforms degrades rapidly.

This work presents a novel parallel simulation approach that is targeted toward acceleration of virtual platforms from the ESL domain. By trading some timing accuracy, multiprocessor virtual platforms can be accelerated by up to 3.4x on regular quad-core workstations.","1288":"This position paper critically analyses the process to implement the UNESCO Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape (2011), exploring evaluation tools, innovative business\/management models and financing tools for the conservation and regeneration of Historic Urban Landscape (HUL), to make it operational in the perspective of a circular economy model of sustainable development for city\/territory system regeneration. Through evaluation tools, it is possible to pass from general principles to operational practices; to produce empirical evidence of the economic, social and environmental benefits of HUL integrated conservation and regeneration. The challenge of generating a symbiosis between conservation and transformation issues requires adequate evaluation methods, business, management and financing tools, engaging civil society and local stakeholders, capturing both HUL tangible and intangible values to turn the historic urban landscape into a driver of sustainable growth. The analysis carried out in this paper shows that through the suggested tools it is possible to make operational the UNESCO Recommendations, transforming conflicts into opportunities, producing economic attractiveness and strengthen social awareness and cohesion.","1289":"Grand challenges are among the most complex problems for modern societies. Many governments and foundations provide substantial resources to encourage the search for solutions. Due to the significance of these problems, organizations often form partnerships in what we call search consortia to engage in joint search and compete for funding. Prior research on joint search highlights the role of specialized organizations, mainly regarding technological domains, to identify a superior solution. However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders. In this study, we suggest that search consortia are more likely to receive funding when they include representatives of stakeholder concerns, so-called advocacy groups. We extend theory on coordinated exploration in joint search by integrating mechanisms from stakeholder theory and argue that advocacy groups improve the generation of potential solutions and provide legitimacy. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 35,249 consortia that proposed solutions to 2,349 grand challenge problems as part of a large European funding program. Our results show that advocacy groups benefit search consortia, particularly when consortia exhibit a high dispersion of technological knowledge and when they are inexperienced.","1294":"The last decade witnessed a tremendous increase in popularity and usage of social network services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Moreover, advances in Web technologies coupled with social networks has enabled users to not only access, but also generate, content in many forms. The overwhelming amount of produced content and resulting network traffic gives rise to precarious scalability issues for social networks, such as handling a large number of users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, and data storage. There are few surveys conducted to explore the different dimensions of social networks, such as security, privacy, and data acquisition. Most of the surveys focus on privacy or security-related issues and do not specifically address scalability challenges faced by social networks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study of social networks along with their significant characteristics and categorize social network architectures into three broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) hybrid. We also highlight various scalability issues faced by social network architectures.

In this paper, an office climate monitoring and control system is designed and implemented. The system consists of various wireless sensor nodes and a control node. The sensor nodes provide the sensor data necessary to determine occupancy and the control node executes the algorithm, which decides whether to activate cooling or heating based on the sensor data. This system can serve as a controller and can be integrated into HVAC systems in smart buildings. It is shown that the developed control algorithm executed on the control node results in an improvement of up to 39% in energy efficiency over conventional ON-OFF controllers for HVAC systems.","1302":"The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context.","1303":"In optogenetics, researchers use light and genetically encoded photoreceptors to control biological processes with unmatched precision. However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments.","1304":["Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt.","In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation.

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.","1308":"Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Then the operation and use of free and open source software are detailed to meet the needs of open hardware innovators. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach with 3-D printing. The results showed how the Free Inactive Patent Search enables users to search using plain language text to find public domain concepts and then provides a hyperlinked list of ideas that takes users to the USPTO database for the patent for more information. All of the source code to operate the search and the website are open source themselves and provided in the public domain for free.

Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario.","1316":"The open-source release of self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) has created a rich opportunity for low-cost distributed digital fabrication of complex 3-D objects such as scientific equipment. For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications.

The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing an individual navigation task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future.","1325":["The deformation monitoring of structures and buildings is an important task field of modern engineering surveying, ensuring the standing and reliability of supervised objects over a long period.

The experiment can be used to determine the particle size in dilute monodisperse colloidal suspensions with surprisingly high accuracy and is, thus, suitable to demonstrate relations between scattering measurements and microscopic properties of particles within undergraduate lab course projects.","1334":"Software bugs are a critical threat to the deployability and maintainability of low-power wireless sensors, resulting in excess power consumption, hardware misconfigurations, incorrect data, and shortened device lifetimes. Worse, these errors can prevent wireless reprogramming, resulting in longer delays and costly human interventions. This letter describes shoulder angel-an ultra-low-power, low-cost, open hardware and software platform that ensures users can always recover and reprogram wireless sensors, in spite of software errors. Shoulder angel uses a physically separate coprocessor to monitor a device's power consumption and other behaviors, while keeping the device in a reprogrammable state. Our results show that shoulder angel is able to recover from otherwise fatal software errors while incurring an energy overhead of only 7 mu W.","1335":"Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach.

In particular, the ideal of hacking as developed through studies of free and open source (F\/OS) has highlighted the value of processes of participation, including participatory governance, in relation to the value of expanded accessibility of knowledge, including knowledge commons. Yet, these means and ends are often conflated. This article employs three examples of projects where hacker-inspired perspectives on scientific knowledge conflict with institutional perspectives. Each example develops differently the relationships between means and ends in relation to authority and legitimacy. The article's analysis suggests that while hacker culture's focus on authority through participation has had great traction in business and in public interest science, this may come limit the contribution to knowledge in the public interest - especially knowledge commons.","1341":"The combination of open-source software and hardware provides technically feasible methods to create low-cost, highly customized scientific research equipment.

The appearance of new urban places for technological innovation is reviving the ageing industrial processes of this manufacturing city. It is supposed to transform Shenzhen into the Silicon Valley of hardware. Two groups, one local, the shanzhai community made up of entrepreneurs and companies historically based on a strategy of imitating highend products, and the other, a more international maker community, are thought to be the main drivers of this change using values of 'open innovation'. The building of this ecosystem relies largely on practices associated with being open-source. Like in California, open innovation contributed to the creation of resources for the development of a vast high-tech industry. This ethnographic field study shows how, while both communities, the international makers and the shanzhai, draw on open innovation, they do not have the same values. For the shanzhai, open innovation means total deregulation and a kind of coopetition that poorly masks fierce competition. For the makers, open innovation does not entirely eliminate the classic tension between 'open' and 'closed' commons in the world of makers. These two communities still rarely collaborate.","1345":"Citizen science is increasingly being used in diverse research domains. With the emergence and rapid development of sensor technologies, citizens potentially have more powerful tools to collect data and generate information to understand their living environment.

In this paper, we analyse the practical experiences from an implementation of citizen sensing for urban environment monitoring. A bottom-up model in which citizens develop and use sensors for environmental monitoring is described and assessed. The paper focuses on a case study of Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab using NO2 sensors for air quality monitoring.

Based on the assessment, suggestions are proposed for further implementations and research.","1354":"Continuous hydrologic monitoring is limited in many regions of the world, creating serious knowledge gaps for water resources managers and scientists. Recent advances in open-source software and hardware technologies, such as the Arduino project, show potential for the development of low-cost (similar to$100) automated dataloggers required for continuous data collection. We developed an Arduino-based datalogger (the Ecohydro Logger) coupled with water sensors providing digital output to establish a hydrologic monitoring network in the data-scarce wet-dry tropics of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. While we experienced some challenges with a first iteration of our Arduinobased datalogger, an improved version was robust and able to capture long periods of high-frequency stream discharge data. Integration of the monitoring program into the local community was also key to successful deployment, allowing exchange of local knowledge and support.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning.

Involving and empowering citizens as active managers of their health represents a desirable shift from the current culture mainly focused on treatment of disease, to one also focused on continuous health management and well-being. Current developments in technological areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and Identification Platform (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications.

It focuses on information and communication technology (ICT) applications and building information modeling (BIM) through a case study from an architect point of view. ICT-related applications have drawn attention from smart buildings as potential means of providing correlations between users and building systems to improve energy efficiency and comfort. This work attempts to present the main progress in the fields of energy efficiency and energy management strategies through a cost-effective ICT application. In order to investigate whether users can take advantage of natural environmental factors during occupied hours in office buildings, daylight and energy performance simulations were carried out. This work explores users as the primary factors to improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and energy efficiency. The results support the use of real-time monitoring systems in office buildings. It seems, however, that there is a need for individual user control of thermal, ventilation, and lighting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses this problem by proposing a completely democratized optical network infrastructure. It introduces the novel concepts of the optical white box and bare metal optical switch as key technology enablers for democratizing optical networks. These are programmable optical switches whose hardware is loosely connected internally and is completely separated from their control software. To alleviate their complexity, a multi-dimensional abstraction mechanism using software-defined network technology is proposed. It creates a universal model of the proposed switches without exposing their technological details. It also enables a conventional network programmer to develop network applications for control of the optical network without specific technical knowledge of the physical layer. Furthermore, a novel optical network virtualization mechanism is proposed, enabling the composition and operation of multiple coexisting and application-specific virtual optical networks sharing the same physical infrastructure. Finally, the optical white box and the abstraction mechanism are experimentally evaluated, while the virtualization mechanism is evaluated with simulation.","1388":"A fault-tolerant control scheme for the autopilot of the small fixed-wing UAV is designed and tested by the actual flight experiments. The small fixed-wing UAV called Xiang Fei is developed independently by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The flight control system is designed based on an open-source autopilot (Pixhawk). Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS is introduced due to its high accuracy. Some modifications on the longitudinal and lateral guidance laws are achieved to improve the flight control performance. Moreover, a data fusion based fault-tolerant control scheme is integrated in altitude control and speed control for altitude sensor failure and airspeed sensor failure, which are the common problems for small fixed-wing UAV. Finally, the real flight experiments are implemented to test the fault-tolerant control based autopilot of UAV. Real flight test results are given and analyzed in detail, which show that the fixed-wing UAV can track the desired altitude and speed commands during the whole flight process including takeoff, climbing, cruising, gliding, landing, and wave-off by the fault-tolerant control based autopilot.","1390":"The application of White Rabbit precision time protocol (WR-PTP) in long-distance optical fiber links has been investigated. WR-PTP is an implementation of PTP in synchronous Ethernet optical fiber networks, originally intended for synchronization of equipment within a range of 10 km. This paper discusses the results and limitations of two implementations of WR-PTP in the existing communication fiber networks. A 950-km WR-PTP link was realized using unidirectional paths in a fiber pair between Espoo and Kajaani, Finland. The time transfer on this link was compared (after initial calibration) against a clock comparison by GPS precise point positioning (PPP). The agreement between the two methods remained within +\/- 2 ns over three months of measurements. Another WR-PTP implementation was realized between Delft and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, by cascading two links of 137 km each. In this case, the WR links were realized as bidirectional paths in single fibers. The measured time offset between the starting and end points of the link was within 5 ns with an uncertainty of 8 ns, mainly due to the estimated delay asymmetry caused by chromatic dispersion.","1393":"The drift of inertial navigation system (INS) will lead to large navigation error when a low-cost INS is used in microaerial vehicles (MAV). To overcome the above problem, an INS\/optical flow\/magnetometer integrated navigation scheme is proposed for GPS-denied environment in this paper. The scheme, which is based on extended Kalman filter, combines INS and optical flow information to estimate the velocity and position of MAV. The gyro, accelerator, and magnetometer information are fused together to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is at static state or uniformly moving state; and the gyro only is used to estimate the MAV attitude when the MAV is accelerating or decelerating. The MAV flight data is used to verify the proposed integrated navigation scheme, and the verification results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the errors of navigation parameters and improve navigation precision.","1396":"Biological processes are inherently multi-scale, and supramolecular complexes at the nanoscale determine changes at the cellular scale and beyond. Single-molecule localizationmicroscopy (SMLM)(1-3) techniques have been established as important tools for studying cellular features with resolutions of the order of around 10 nm. However, in their current form these modalities are limited by a highly constrained field of view (FOV) and field-dependent image resolution. Here, we develop a low-cost microlens array (MLA)-based epi-illumination system-flat illumination for field-independent imaging (FIFI)-that can efficiently and homogeneously perform simultaneous imaging of multiple cells with nanoscale resolution. The optical principle of FIFI, which is an extension of the Kohler integrator, is further elucidated and modelled with a new, free simulation package. We demonstrate FIFI's capabilities by imaging multiple COS-7 and bacteria cells in 100 x 100 mu m(2) SMLM images-more than quadrupling the size of a typical FOV and producing near-gigapixel-sized images of uniformly high quality.","1397":"Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and loT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudloT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudloT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudloT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudloT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms - both proprietary and open source - and projects implementing the CloudloT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In order to improve MEMS performance, it is proposed to fuse MEMS-IMU information with optical flow, and correct MEMS attitude when it is diverged. Then, image coordinate of optical flow is proposed to be firstly transformed to body one for better vehicle attitude calculation. The Allan variances of MEMS sensors are used in KF filter to replace the regular white noise.

Rather than discussing it as a model of organising work, the study conceives free software as a production tool and shows how it becomes a locus of politics about finding material security in flexible capitalism. This politics is ultimately contradictory in that it extends creative and craft autonomy of digital artists but does not mobilise a critical project. Instead, it nurtures further precarious labour.

These measurements are very often difficult to translate into irrigation advice. Soil water potential (SWP), however, is a basic soil water status variable that is correlated with plant water uptake, and it can easily be measured using sensors. Soil water potential can provide useful support for irrigation scheduling at the field scale, thus enhancing water savings in agricultural areas. In this work, we present the results of an experimental study conducted in the 2014 agricultural season on a peach orchard located in Lodi (Northern Italy). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an irrigation scheduling based on continuous SWP measurements collected at two soil depths (-15 and -35 cm) on the crop water status and the peach production relative to the farmer's commonly adopted irrigation practice. To answer the question in the title, periodic measurements of physiological parameters such as leaf water potential, stomatal resistance (r(s)), transpiration (E), and crop water stress index were performed, along with monitoring of fruit size evolution and fruit sugar content at harvest. All of these variables were measured to assess the crop physiological state of the trees subjected to the two different irrigation treatments, with the final objective of determining whether the irrigation scheduling based on SWP measurements compromised the quality and quantity of produced peaches. Although obtained for only one agricultural season, the results showed that no considerably crop water stress occurred, even for the irrigation treatment based on SWP measurements. In particular, the most extreme values of leaf water potential, r(s), E, and crop water stress index measured at midday were -2 MPa, 45 s m(-1), 1.4 mm h(-1) and 0.5, respectively, which are in good agreement with those observed in many studies for well-watered orchards in Mediterranean areas. In conclusion, we can stress that SWP monitoring can be considered to be a reliable alternative to the more costly and time-consuming physiological measurements for the irrigation scheduling of fruit crops such as peach orchards. This approach provides continuous information about the soil water status, thereby preventing plant water stress and reducing irrigation water consumption at the farm scale.","1446":"Communication networks these days face a relentless increase in traffic load. Multi-gigabit-per-second links are becoming widespread, and network devices are under continuous stress, so testing whether they guarantee the specified throughput or delay is a must. Software-based solutions, such as packet-train traffic injection, were adequate for lower speeds, but they have become inaccurate in the current scenario. Hardware-based solutions have proved to be very accurate, but usually at the expense of much higher development and acquisition costs. Fortunately, new affordable FPGA SoC devices, as well as high-level synthesis tools, can very efficiently reduce these costs. In this article we show the advantages of hardware-based solutions in terms of accuracy, comparing the results obtained in an FPGA SoC development platform and in NetFPGA-10G to those of software. Results show that a hardware-based solution is significantly better, especially at 10 Gb\/s. By leveraging high-level synthesis and open source platforms, prototypes were quickly developed. Noticeable advantages of our proposal are high accuracy, competitive cost with respect to the software counterpart, which runs in high-end off-the-shelf workstations, and the capability to easily evolve to upcoming 40 Gb\/s and 100 Gb\/s networks.","1447":"The Internet of Things (IoT), often referred as the future Internet; is a collection of interconnected devices integrated into the world-wide network that covers almost everything and could be available anywhere.

The requirements of flexibility, mobility, and cost have created a strong push toward wireless solutions, preferably solutions requiring low power. Simultaneously, the increased need for interoperability and integration with the wider Internet made a transition to IP-based communication unavoidable. Following these trends, we survey 6TiSCH, the emerging family of standards for IP-based industrial communication over low-power and lossy networks. We describe the state of the standardization work, the major issues being discussed, and open questions recently identified. Based on extensive first-hand experience, we discuss challenges in implementation of this new wave of standards.

These systems consist of a variety of different components\/sensors and many processes like clustering, routing, security, and self-organization. Routing is necessary for medical-based WSNs because it allows remote data delivery and it facilitates network scalability in large hospitals. However, routing entails several problems, mainly due to the open nature of wireless networks, and these need to be addressed. This paper looks at two of the problems that arise due to wireless routing between the nodes and access points of a medical WSN (for IoT use): black hole and selective forwarding (SF) attacks. A solution to the former can readily be provided through the use of cryptographic hashes, while the latter makes use of a neighbourhood watch and threshold-based analysis to detect and correct SF attacks. The scheme proposed here is capable of detecting a selective forwarding attack with over 96% accuracy and successfully identifying the malicious node with 83% accuracy.","1457":"This work presents the City Dynamics and Smart Environment activities of the Smart Ring project, a model for the smart city, based on the integration of sustainable urban transport services and environmental monitoring over a 4-5-km circular path, the Smart Ring, around the historical center of l'Aquila (Italy).

Data were collected and analyzed on the bases of an air quality index, which provided qualitative insights on the air status potentially experienced by the users. The results obtained are in agreement with the synoptic meteorological conditions, the urban background air quality reference measurements and the potential traffic flow variations. Furthermore, they indicated that the air quality status was influenced by the gas component NO and CO.

We argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. Likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the NFCC is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the HMPP is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons.

In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform.

The operation of the machine is validated and the performance of the system is quantified for the mechanical properties (peak load) and weld width of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lap welds manufactured with the system as a function of linear energy density. The results provide incident laser power and machine parameters that enable both dual (two layers) and multilayer (three layers while welding only two sheets) polymer welded systems.

They have the potential to disrupt existing socio-economic facets of everyday life. Yet few studies have analysed the development of robotics innovation. This paper closes this gap by analysing current developments in innovation in robotics; how it is diffused, and what role is played by intellectual property (IP). The paper argues that robotics clusters are mainly located in the US and Europe, despite a growing presence in South Korea and China. The robotics innovation ecosystem builds on cooperative networks of actors, including individuals, research institutions, and firms. Governments play a significant role in supporting robotics innovation through funding, military demand, and national robotics strategies. Robotics competitions and prizes provide an important incentive for innovation. Patents are used to exclude third parties to secure freedom of operation, license technologies, and avoid litigation. The countries with the highest number of patent claims arc Japan, China, South Korea, and the US. The growing stock of patents owned by universities and PROs, particularly in China, is noteworthy too. Automotive and electronics companies are still the largest patent filers, but medical technologies and the Internet are emerging as new actors in the field. Secrecy is often used as a tool to appropriate innovation. Copyright protection is relevant to robotics also, mainly for its role in protecting software. Finally, open-source robotics platforms are increasingly used in the early stages of the innovation process as they allow new actors in the robotics field to optimize their initial spending on innovation.","1479":"Typical Lab-on-a-Disc (LoaD) platforms cannot make a continuous measurement while the disc is spinning; this drawback means that the disc usually must be stopped and aligned with a sensor. This can result in measurement errors in time-dependent assays along with inaccuracies due to liquid displacement and bubble formation in the absence of a stabilising centrifugal field. This paper presents a novel concept for a wirelessly electrified-Lab-on-a-Disc (eLoaD) platform that allows continuous measurement of experimental parameters while the disc is spinning. This platform incorporates all the components needed for measurement within the rotating frame of reference, and bidirectional transmission of data outside this reference frame, thus allowing for online measurement independent of the rotation of the disc. The eLoaD platform is conceived in a modular manner whereby an interchangeable and non-disposable 'Application Disc' can be fitted to the eLoaD platform and so the system can be adapted for a range of optical, electrochemical and other measurement types. As an application example, optical readout, using the Application Disc fitted with a silicon photomultiplier, is demonstrated using a tagged chemiluminescent antibody, which is commonly used, for instance, in ELISA assays. The precision of the eLoaD platform is >94%, while its accuracy, when compared to a commercial benchtop luminometer, is higher than 96%. The modular design of this platform will permit extension of this technology to many other LoaD applications.","1481":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the experiential learning of electronics subject matter is effective in the middle school open learning of robotics. Electronics is often ignored in robotics courses. Since robotics courses are typically comprised of computer-related subjects, and mechanical and electrical engineering, these three areas should be emphasized equally. Many studies reveal impressive learning of computer science and mechanical engineering, but clear evidence of the effectiveness of electronics learning in the higher order thinking skills of middle school students is still lacking. We designed three different robotics courses with electronics subject matter introduced through experiential learning. A parallel group design was used, where three different open learning courses were implemented for middle school students. Based on results of the first and second implementations, we improved students' learning of relevant content for each successive step of the experiment. In total, 381 middle school students participated in all experiments and were surveyed using pre- and post-tests. The collected data were analyzed using a quantitative research methodology. The findings revealed that the teaching approach was effective. During the learning process, student interest in robotics increased, and overall achievement improved with a medium effect size (eta(2) = 0.13). The best results for the learning of electronics subject matter were found in the learning process (eta(2) = 0.44), where experimental sharing of electronics parts was the most evident approach used by the students. Examination of learning material structure in light of the shared electronics subject matter is analyzed and discussed and possible directions for future research are presented.","1482":"An emerging topic in the development field is how information and communication technology (ICT) can be used for economic and social development. The general approach relies on technological determinism, whereby the discussion revolves around how and to what extent will ICT support development. It assumes the benefits of ICT as inherent. This approach ignores that ICT is created and experienced within a socially divisive and complex space. A more critical and sociological analysis is needed for development studies to better understand the implications of ICT initiatives. In this article, I argue that Saskia Sassen's analytical framework of technology and society as embedded avoids this technological determinism and allows social theorists to account for social and material aspects of ICT. To support this alternative framework, I present a case study of a rural ICT initiative in Gujarat, India, and discuss how this re-conceptualization reveals more nuanced understanding of ICT and society. Based on interviews and field research, I find that technology creates new social understandings for the rural ICT users, but also that society shapes the technology to make it inaccessible for them.","1484":"The objective of this work is to develop a framework that can deploy and provide coordination between multiple heterogeneous agents when a swarm robotic system adopts a decentralized approach; each robot evaluates its relative rank among the other robots in terms of travel distance and cost to the goal. Accordingly, robots are allocated to the sub-tasks for which they have the highest rank (utility). This paper provides an analysis of existing swarm control environments and proposes a software environment that facilitates a rapid deployment of multiple robotic agents. The framework (UBSwarm) exploits our utility-based task allocation algorithm. UBSwarm configures these robots and assigns the group of robots a particular task from a set of available tasks. Two major tasks have been introduced that show the performance of a robotic group. This robotic group is composed of heterogeneous agents. In the results, a premature example that has prior knowledge about the experiment shows whether or not the robots are able to accomplish the task.","1485":"Developing self-organised swarm systems capable of adapting to environmental changes as well as to dynamic situations is a complex challenge. An efficient labour division model, with the ability to regulate the distribution of work among swarm robots, is an important element of this kind of system. This paper extends the popular response threshold model and proposes a new adaptive response threshold model (ARTM). Experiments were carried out in simulation and in real-robot scenarios with the aim of studying the performance of this new adaptive model. Results presented in this paper verify that the extended approach improves on the adaptability of previous systems. For example, by reducing collision duration among robots in foraging missions, our approach helps small swarms of robots to adapt more efficiently to changing environments, thus increasing their self-sustainability (survival rate). Finally, we propose a minimal version of ARTM, which is derived from the conclusions drawn through real-robot and simulation results.","1486":"Energy consumption in battery operated mobile devices is a critical issue. Autonomy periods are increasingly compromised as the complexity of tasks, such as the widespread video decoding ones, is also increased. While new higher-capacity batteries are being developed, techniques to control, i.e. save, the energy consumption can provide a significant benefit. This paper presents the proposal, implementation and test of a real-time closed-loop control system applicable to the power-consumption regulation of multimedia mobile devices. The novel closed loop does not need any specific power sensor but only standard performance monitoring counters (PMCs) available in common mobile processors. From them, the power consumption is estimated with an algorithm to be included into the operating system, along with the control system itself. A theoretical system model has been first developed to (1) enable the design of some controllers and (2) validate the actual results obtained from the control system prototype into a given low-cost development board. These results prove the control-system stability and the comparative suitability of classic controllers to keep the multimedia-system consumption close to the desired value in steady state with settling times as short as a single sample interval(1).","1489":"This article develops the concept of \"smart velomobility\" that is concerned with networked practices, systems and technologies of cycling. The concept draws on velomobility, Smart Mobility\/Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Smart Cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). The article presents results from an empirical study, where 80 riders of a networked fleet of e-bikes discuss their experience of smart velomobility. The results show how digital and physical mobilities merge, the way riders of the networked fleet interact with the data, how they share the data and how they feel tracked (privacy). The conclusion sketches out future research of \"smart velomobilities\" and also points out the policy and innovation potential of cycling as active, sustainable and networked mode of transport in the context of Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.

In the development of an AQMS, we have used the GSM wireless communication module. The developed system is capable of the real-time measurement of air polluted gases, such as CO2, CO, NO2, and SO2. The machine-to-machine communication of the air quality monitoring station and PC with the sink node was successfully implemented. Various gas sensor technologies were evaluated for the system and ultimately electrochemical and infrared sensors were used. Hardware and software for an AQMS was designed and implemented. The AQMS uses an array of sensors to take the measurements of the ambient air surrounding it and wirelessly transmits the data to the base station. A graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy for end user(s) to interact with the system, was developed. Gas concentration values are plotted on the GUI. The defined calibration of the instruments at time interims assures that the desired accuracy is sustained. This paper offers further elucidations to design disputes raised in earlier studies.","1495":"Software packages for 3D design and additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, initially known as rapid prototyping (RP) have emerged during the last years, as a cutting edge solutions for custom prototyping. These new tools and technologies lower the design costs, but also allow rapid creation of fully functional components. This paper describes the FDM and 3DP rapid prototyping technologies that were used to create elements and tools in the wood industry field. Total costs of manufacturing related to the fabrication of sample elements and tools are analysed. One of the main recognised issues of wider application of rapid prototyping technologies is their still very high costs related to all production aspects, starting with a lack of available materials, material cost, up to high cost of available commercial equipment, usually focused only on specific solutions and limited range of materials. Generally, AM costs can be divided into the group of fixed costs and variable ones. This paper deals with the optimization of the production costs of fabricated elements in case of small-scale production, and optimization of variable costs (processing and post-processing, costs of enforcement, and material costs).","1498":"Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters provides farmers with useful information, which can improve the quality and productivity of crops grown in greenhouses. The objective of this study was to develop a greenhouse environment measurement system using a low-cost microcontroller with open-source software. Greenhouse environment parameters measured were air temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The ranges of the temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration were -40 to 120 degrees C, 0 to 100%, and 0 to 10,000 ppm, respectively. A 128 x 64 graphic LCD display was used for real-time monitoring of the greenhouse environments. An Arduino Uno R3 consisted of a USB interface for communicating with a computer, 6 analog inputs, and 14 digital input\/output pins. A temperature\/relative humidity sensor was connected to digital pins 2 and 3. A CO2 sensor was connected to digital pins 12 and 13. The LCD was connected to digital pin 1 (TX). The sketches were programmed with the Arduino Software (IDE). A measurement system including the Arduino board, sensors, and accessories was developed (totaling $244). Data for the environmental parameters in a venlo-type greenhouse were obtained using this system without any problems. We expect that the low-cost microcontroller using open-source software can be used for monitoring the environments of plastic greenhouses in Korea.","1499":"Energy neutral operation of WSNs can be achieved by exploiting the idleness of the workload to bring the average power consumption of each node below the harvesting power available. This paper proposes a combination of state-of-the-art low-power design techniques to minimize the local and global impact of the two main activities of each node: sampling and communication. Dynamic power management is adopted to exploit low-power modes during idle periods, while asynchronous wake-up and prediction based data collection are used to opportunistically activate hardware components and network nodes only when they are strictly required. Furthermore, the concept of \"model-based sensing\" is introduced to push prediction-based data collection techniques as close as possible to the sensing elements. The results achieved on representative real-world WSN case studies show that the combined benefits of the design techniques adopted is more than linear, providing an overall power reduction of more than three orders of magnitude.

This shift has considerable socio-economic and cultural implications that are too often ignored by the existing economic and political economy literatures. This article surveys key patterns in the adoption of digital platforms across Europe, and finds, based on an array of quantitative metrics, apparently contradictory trends. We observe, on one hand, the rise of closed TV platforms as the paradigmatic commercial model of the new media landscape; but on the other, the cultural and material openness of the Internet, which is radically transforming the consumption of television. While hybrid arrangements abound, industry solutions are still awkwardly matched to consumer preferences. Without drawing too sharp a line between technology and culture, the article presents an overview of the many ways the changing meaning of digital platforms continues to shape the global television industry.

Its dependence on the elastic properties means that vibration resonance tests are favored over other - often destructive - tests. We present a novel non-destructive and non-contacting method using laser-generated and laser-detected elastic waves to infer the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of an apple from the velocity of surface and body waves. In addition, we analyze the attenuation of these waves. Although the elastic and anelastic properties all decay with age, attenuation is the most sensitive to changes in ripeness of the apple.

However, as robots become better integrated in therapeutic environments, they will also influence therapists; and if robots are designed correctly, they could positively influence therapists' well-being. Understanding how robots could be used in such a way is especially important as therapists of autistic children (and therapists of mentally disabled people in general) have one of the highest risks of workplace burnout. This paper describes a series of studies conducted to understand therapists' attitudes towards robotic support and to discover what is most needed in such devices; this paper also describes an experimental study of the feasibility of robots playing one of those roles. Through observational studies and a series of ten meetings, with a group of seven therapists of autism, a list of possible roles was created. In a larger questionnaire based study, therapists gave a ranking to various robot roles and functions (a child's behaviour analyser and support in critical\/dangerous situations were given the highest priority). Therapists also stated that they expect robots to help them in the workplace, help prepare documentation and make their work more systematic. In a Wizard-of-Oz type experimental study, a robot was used to play a role of \"emotional mirror\" with seven therapist-child pairs. Study participants stated that a robot was acceptable and was not disturbing, although most did not find it particularly useful. Our conclusions indicate that therapists want robots to play a larger role than just a therapeutic device, and such roles can be added to robots without disturbing sessions with clients.","1505":"The research area of the compressed baryonic matter - CBM experiment (FAIR\/GSI in Darmstadt) is sub-nuclear physics, thus hadron-baryon and quark-gluon, and the essence of phase transitions in the area of hot nuclear matter, and dense strongly interacting matter. Our interest in this paper are mainly considerations on the impact of such large infrastructural experiments and possibilities they give to local, smaller but very active, university based research groups and communities. Research and technical input from such groups is depicted on the background of the CBM detector infrastructure and electronic instrumentation just under design and test fabrication for this experiment. An essential input to this research originates from Poland via the agreed in-kind contribution. The areas of expertise of these groups are: superconductivity, structural large scale cabling, precision machined parts, RF and microwave technology, analog and advanced digital electronics, distributed measurement and control systems, etc.","1507":"Some earthquakes generate tsunamis in the ocean or coastal regions. An early alert is essential for the coastal population to prevent loss of human life. The propagation of the alert is made through a range of communication means: radio, television, sirens, landlines and cell phones, social media including Twitter, and, if electrical power and communications utilities are blacked-out, through an alternative opportunistic network. In this article, a special device, named Witness Unit (WU), designed to work with a satellite network is presented as an alternative communications means in a temporarily degraded disaster environment. A greedy heuristic algorithm for the placement and deployment of the WUs is introduced and its interaction with emergency managers and citizens is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a need to screen a given drug against a bacterial infection outside of the laboratory. To address this need, we have designed and built an inexpensive and easy-to-use 3D-printer-based system that allows easily readable quantitative tests for the performance of antibacterial drugs. The platform creates a sterile diagnostic device by using 3D printing, and the device is filled automatically with growth medium, and then antibiotics are sprayed onto the medium by ink-jet technology. The sample for testing can be introduced via a fluid port, and the printer hot bed is used to incubate the device, allowing operation in the field. Combining advantages from various established tests of antibacterial performance, this allows the comparison of a specific antibiotics and bacteria. Also, this system can create and test several antibiotic formulations for therapeutic use, and we demonstrate this potential by investigating a mixture of pathogens that are only killed by a mixture of drugs.","1511":"An approach for long term localization, stabilization, and navigation of micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environment is presented in this paper. The proposed method relies strictly on onboard sensors of employed MAVs and does not require any external positioning system. The core of the method consists in extraction of information from pictures consequently captured using a camera carried by the particular MAV. Visual features are obtained from images of the surface under the MAV, and stored into a map that is represented by these features. The position of the MAV is then obtained through matching with previously stored features. An important part of the proposed system is a novel approach for exploration and mapping of the workspace of robots. This method enables efficient exploring of the unknown environment, while keeping the iteratively built map of features consistent. The proposed algorithm is suitable for mapping of surfaces, both outdoor and indoor, with various density of the image features. The sufficient precision and long term persistence of the method allows its utilization for stabilization of large MAV groups that work in formations with small relative distances between particular vehicles. Numerous experiments with quadrotor helicopters and various numerical simulations have been realized for verification of the entire system and its components.","1513":"A soft condensed matter sensor (SCMS) designed to measure strains on the human body is presented. The hybrid material based on carbon black (CB) and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was bonded to a textile elastic band and used as a sensor on the human wrist to measure hand motion by detecting the movement of tendons in the wrist. Additionally it was able to track the blood pulse wave of a person, allowing for the determination of pulse wave peaks corresponding to the systole and diastole blood pressures in order to calculate the heart rate. Sensor characterization was done using mechanical cycle testing, and the band sensor achieved a gauge factor of 4-6.3 while displaying low signal relaxation when held at a strain levels. Near-linear signal performance was displayed when loading to successively higher strain levels up to 50% strain.","1514":"The present work studies the effect of three insect-proof screens with different geometrical and aerodynamic characteristics on the air velocity and temperature inside a Mediterranean multi-span greenhouse with three roof vents and without crops, divided into two independent sectors. First, the insect-proof screens were characterised geometrically by analysing digital images and testing in a low velocity wind tunnel. The wind tunnel tests gave screen discharge coefficient values of C-d,C-phi of 0.207 for screen 1 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 35.0%), 0.151 for screen 2 (13 x 30 threads.cm(-2); phi = 26.3%) and 0.325 for screen 3 (10 x 20 threads.cm(-2); porosity phi = 36.0%), at an air velocity of 0.25 m.s(-1). Secondly, when screens were installed in the greenhouse, we observed a statistical proportionality between the discharge coefficient at the openings and the air velocity u(i) measured in the centre of the greenhouse, u(i) = 0.856 C-d + 0.062 (R-2 = 0.68 and p-value = 0.012). The inside-outside temperature difference Delta T-io diminishes when the inside velocity increases following the statistically significant relationship Delta T-io = (-135.85 + 57.88\/u(i))(0.5) (R-2 = 0.85 and p-value = 0.0011). Different thread diameters and tension affects the screen thickness, and means that similar porosities may well be associated with very different aerodynamic characteristics. Screens must be characterised by a theoretical function C-d,C-phi = [(2e mu\/K-p rho).(1\/u(s)) + (2eY\/K(p)0.5)](-0.5) that relates the discharge coefficient of the screen C-d,C-phi with the air velocity us. This relationship depends on the three parameters that define the aerodynamic behaviour of porous medium: permeability K-p, inertial factor Y and screen thickness e (and on air temperature that determine its density rho and viscosity mu). However, for a determined temperature of air, the pressure drop-velocity relationship can be characterised only with two parameters: Delta P = au(s)(2) + bu(s).","1518":"The holy grail of smart cities is an integrated, sustainable approach to improve the efficiency of the city's operations and the quality of life of citizens. At the heart of this vision is the citizen, who is the primary beneficiary of smart city initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six citizen-related challenges: the engagement of citizens, the improvement of citizens' data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services, and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a way of transferring insights and solutions from GIScience to smart cities.","1520":"We present a high content multiwell plate cell-based assay approach to quantify protein interactions directly in cells using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) read out by automated fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Automated FLIM is implemented using wide-field time-gated detection, typically requiring only 10 s per field of view (FOV). Averaging over biological, thermal and shot noise with 100's to 1000's of FOV enables unbiased quantitative analysis with high statistical power. Plotting average donor lifetime vs. acceptor\/donor intensity ratio clearly identifies protein interactions and fitting to double exponential donor decay models provides estimates of interacting population fractions that, with calibrated donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities, can yield dissociation constants. We demonstrate the application to identify binding partners of MST1 kinase and estimate interaction strength among the members of the RASSF protein family, which have important roles in apoptosis via the Hippo signalling pathway. K-D values broadly agree with published biochemical measurements.","1521":"Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major threat to human health, but broad-spectrum antibiotics are losing efficacy.

In particular, heterodyne and homodyne interferometry can accurately measure particle velocity and displacements at a specific point in space thus enabling the acoustical pressure to be measured in an absolute, direct, assumption-free manner, with traceability through the SI definition of the metre. The calibration of a hydrophone can then be performed by placing the active element of the sensor at the point where the acoustic pressure field was measured and monitoring its electrical output. However, it is crucial to validate the performance and accuracy of such optical methods by direct comparison rather than through device calibration. Here we report on the direct comparison of two such optical interferometers used in underwater acoustics and ultrasonics in terms of acoustic pressure estimation and their associated uncertainties in the frequency range 200 kHz-3.5 MHz, with results showing agreement better than 1% in terms of pressure and typical expanded uncertainties better than 3% for both reported methods.","1525":"Twitter's hashtag functionality is now used for a very wide variety of purposes, from covering crises and other breaking news events through gathering an instant community around shared media texts (such as sporting events and TV broadcasts) to signalling emotive states from amusement to despair. These divergent uses of the hashtag are increasingly recognised in the literature, with attention paid especially to the ability for hashtags to facilitate the creation of ad hoc or hashtag publics. A more comprehensive understanding of these different uses of hashtags has yet to be developed, however. Previous research has explored the potential for a systematic analysis of the quantitative metrics that could be generated from processing a series of hashtag datasets. Such research found, for example, that crisis-related hashtags exhibited a significantly larger incidence of retweets and tweets containing URLs than hashtags relating to televised events, and on this basis hypothesised that the information-seeking and -sharing behaviours of Twitter users in such different contexts were substantially divergent. This article updates such study and their methodology by examining the communicative metrics of a considerably larger and more diverse number of hashtag datasets, compiled over the past five years. This provides an opportunity both to confirm earlier findings, as well as to explore whether hashtag use practices may have shifted subsequently as Twitter's userbase has developed further; it also enables the identification of further hashtag types beyond the \"crisis\" and \"mainstream media event\" types outlined to date. The article also explores the presence of such patterns beyond recognised hashtags, by incorporating an analysis of a number of keyword-based datasets. This large-scale, comparative approach contributes towards the establishment of a more comprehensive typology of hashtags and their publics, and the metrics it describes will also be able to be used to classify new hashtags emerging in the future. In turn, this may enable researchers to develop systems for automatically distinguishing newly trending topics into a number of event types, which may be useful for example for the automatic detection of acute crises and other breaking news events.","1526":"Wide-field optical flow information can benefit the navigation of small or micro unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-degraded\/denied environments, inspired by the study of insect\/bird flights. This paper focuses on a flight-test evaluation of navigation information in wide-field optical flow, using flight data collected by a wide-angle camera installed on a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle at altitudes ranging from 30 to 183m above the ground. A comprehensive evaluation methodology is proposed for the comparison between optical flows computed from videos and the reference motion fields determined from conventional navigation sensors including GPS, a laser range finder, and inertial sensors. Seven sets of unmanned aerial vehicle flight data including a total of approximately 72,000 image frames are used for both full-flight temporal evaluation and representative interframe spatial evaluation of wide-field optical flow information for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation purposes. The evaluation results showed a good match between vision-derived optical flows and reference motion fields from conventional navigation sensors. Finally, one benchmark data set is shared at the authors' website for open access from the research community.","1528":"Dense optical flow is a crucial visual cue for obstacle avoidance and motion control for robotic systems functioning in complex unstructured environments. In order to compute image motion for modern highly dynamic robots, it is necessary to use high speed vision systems. To perceive small and thin objects such as tree branches, fence poles, and other similar objects, high resolution vision systems must be used. The data stream from a high-resolution, high-speed vision system will saturate the onboard data bus and overload the onboard processor of almost all existing robotic systems. To implement such a vision system, we believe it is necessary to process the data in situ at the camera using dedicated processing hardware, a vision processing paradigm that we term rapid embedded vision (REV) systems. Even then, the task of processing multiple hundred hertz of dense high-resolution images is not possible using classical algorithms and classical computing hardware. A new processing paradigm that actively exploits the high frame rate of the image sequences, and high performance computing hardware such as GPU or FPGA must be employed. This letter proposes a filtering algorithm for the computation of dense optical flow fields in real time. The filter is designed as a pyramidal structure of update and propagation loops, where an optical flow state is constantly refined with new image data from the camera. The computational properties of the proposed algorithm makes it well suited for implementation in GPU and FPGA systems. We present results from a GPU implementation achieving frame rates in the order of 800 Hz at VGA resolution. Experimental validation and comparison is provided for both synthetic and real life high speed video sequences at frame rates of 300 Hz and 1016 x 544 pixel resolution.","1529":"Open source communities rely on the espoused premise of complete openness and transparency of source code and development process. Yet, openness and transparency at times need to be balanced out with moments of less open and transparent work. Through our detailed study of Linux Kernel development, we build a theory that explains that transparency and openness are nuanced and changing qualities that certain developers manage as they use multiple digital technologies and create, in moments of needs, more opaque and closed digital spaces of work. We refer to these spaces as digital folds. Our paper contributes to the extant literature by providing a process theory of how transparency and openness are balanced with opacity and closure in open source communities according to the needs of the development work; by conceptualizing the nature of digital folds and their role in providing quiet spaces of work; and, by articulating how the process of digital folding and unfolding is made far more possible by select elite actors' navigating the line between the pragmatics of coding and the accepted ideology of openness and transparency.","1530":"Here we present a novel bio-inspired optic flow (OF) sensor and its application to visual. guidance and odometry on a low-cost car-like robot called BioCarBot. The minimalistic OF sensor was robust to high-dynamic-range lighting conditions and to various visual patterns encountered thanks to its M(2)APIX auto-adaptive pixels and the new cross-correlation OF algorithm implemented. The low-cost car-like robot estimated its velocity and steering angle, and therefore its position and orientation, via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) using only two downward-facing OF sensors and the Ackerman steering model. Indoor and outdoor experiments were carried out in which the robot was driven in the closed-loop mode based on the velocity and steering angle estimates. The experimental results obtained show that our novel OF sensor can deliver high-frequency measurements (>300 Hz) in a wide OF range (1.5-15 rad s(-1)) and in a 7-decade high-dynamic light level range. The OF resolution was constant and could be adjusted as required (up to 0.05 rad s(-1)), and the OF precision obtained was relatively high (standard deviation of 0.17 rad s(-1) with an average OF of 4.5 rad s(-1), under the most demanding lighting conditions). An EKF-based algorithm gave the robot's position and orientation with a relatively high accuracy (maximum errors outdoors at a very low light level: 0.95 mand 0.58 rad over about 32 mand 8 pi rad) despite the low-resolution control systems of the steering servo and the DC motor, as well as a simplified model identification and calibration. Finally, the minimalistic OF-based odometry results were compared to those obtained using measurements based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a motor's speed sensor.","1532":"The challenges in deploying robust wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in agricultural environments are limited power supply and variability of wireless propagation channel that restrict performance. Proposed protocols do not meet the challenges for realistic simulation and evaluation of WSN for agricultural applications. The design of LEACH protocol is, for the most part, efficient for many applications. It achieves energy efficiency through a clustering technique with TDMA based MAC layer algorithms and data aggregation method. Analysis performed shows that LEACH uses simple radio propagation and energy models that are unrealistic. This paper focuses on the performance analysis of LEACH protocol for agricultural environments.","1533":"We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry. Here we describe the implementation and performance of the method on a hovering robot equipped with eight 0.65 g optic-flow sensors, and show that it can be used for closed-loop control of various motions.","1537":"The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage.

This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50\/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated. Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid integration with popular numerical simulation environments.","1539":"The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components.

We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage.

IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries.

To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking.

Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and pi\/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback.","1548":"This paper presents a new wireless platform designed for an integrated traffic\/flash flood monitoring system.

This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner.

Yet the focus on agency often glosses over the constraints placed on agents, particularly within asymmetrical power relations. This article follows the case of BabyLegs, a do-it-yourself monitoring tool for marine microplastic pollution, and the attempt to keep the technology open source within an intellectual property (IP) system set up to privatize it. The tactics used to design BabyLegs as a feminine, silly, doll-tool to discredit the device in the eyes of an IP system that valued traditional gender roles lead to the eventual success of keeping the device open source. Yet, those same tactics also reinforced and reproduced the structures of power and essentialism they were designed to resist. I characterize this technological ambivalence as compromise, and argue that all agency exercised within asymmetrical power relations is compromised. This is not to say resistance is futile, but that agency is never pure, and this recognition lets us be more intentional in how we might compromise as practitioners of diverse scientific knowledges.","1573":"Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements.

As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

The ongoing IoT research activities are directed towards the definition and design of open architectures and standards, but there are still many issues requiring a global consensus before the final deployment. The paper presents and discusses the IoT architectural frameworks proposed under the ongoing standardization efforts, design issues in terms of IoT hardware and software components, as well as the IoT application domain representatives, such as smart cities, healthcare, agriculture, and nano-scale applications (addressed within the concept of Internet of Nano-Things). In order to obtain the performances related to recently proposed protocols for emerging Industrial Internet of Things applications, the preliminary results for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport and Time-Slotted Channel Hopping protocols are provided.

Though PDMS is a milestone in microfluidic developments, its cost and handling directed the field to search for new options. 3D printing technology nowadays starts a revolution offering materials and possibilities that can contribute positively to current methodologies. Here we explored the fused deposition modeling 3D printing technique to obtain integrated, transparent and sealed microchannels made with polylactic acid, a cheap alternative material to set up microfluidic systems. Using a home-made 3D printer, devices could be assembled in a simplified process, enabling the integration of different materials such as paper, glass, wire and polymers within the microchannel. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, a 3D-printed electronic tongue sensor was built, enabling the distinction of basic tastes below the human threshold. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.","1621":"The objective of this paper is to describe an ergonomics contribution in maintainability. The economical designs, inputs and training helps to increase the maintainability indicators for industrial devices. This analysis can be helpful, among other cases, to compare systems, to achieve a better design regarding maintainability requirements, to improve this maintainability under specific industrial environment and to foresee maintainability problems due to eventual changes in a device operation conditions. With this purpose, this work first introduces the notion of ergonomics and human factors, maintainability and the implementation of assessment of human postures, including some important postures to perform maintenance activities. A simulation approach is used to identify the critical posture of the maintenance personnel and implements the defined postures with minimal loads on the personnel who use the equipment in a practical scenario. The simulation inputs are given to the designers to improve the workplace\/equipment in order to high level of maintainability. Finally, the work concludes summarizing the more significant aspects and suggesting future research.","1622":"Currently, the manufacturing industry is experiencing a data-driven revolution. There are multiple processes in the manufacturing industry and will eventually generate a large amount of data. Collecting, analyzing and storing a large amount of data are one of key elements of the smart manufacturing industry. To ensure that all processes within the manufacturing industry are functioning smoothly, the big data processing is needed. Thus, in this study an open source-based real-time data processing (OSRDP) architecture framework was proposed. OSRDP architecture framework consists of several open sources technologies, including Apache Kafka, Apache Storm and NoSQL MongoDB that are effective and cost efficient for real-time data processing. Several experiments and impact analysis for manufacturing sustainability are provided. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors data and devices increases. In addition, the data mining based on Random Forest is presented to predict the quality of products given the sensor data as the input. The Random Forest successfully classifies the defect and non-defect products, and generates high accuracy compared to other data mining algorithms. This study is expected to support the management in their decision-making for product quality inspection and support manufacturing sustainability.","1628":"Sometimes traditional lab projects based on standard kits and modules fail to stimulate students' interest and creativity.

This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.","1631":"As the population density continues to grow in the urban settings, air quality is degrading and becoming a serious issue. Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has raised a series of concerns for public health. As a result, a number of large-scale, low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed in several international smart city projects. One of the major challenges for such environmental sensing systems is ensuring the data quality. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework (ADF) for large-scale, real-world environmental sensing systems. The framework is composed of four modules: 1) time-sliced anomaly detection (TSAD), which detects spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal anomalies in the real-time sensor measurement data stream; 2) real-time emission detection, which detects potential regional emission sources; 3) device ranking, which provides a ranking for each sensing device; and 4) malfunction detection, which identifies malfunctioning devices. Using real world measurement data from the AirBox project, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively identify outliers in the raw measurement data as well as infer anomalous events that are perceivable by the general public and government authorities. Because of its simple design, ADF is highly extensible to other advanced applications, and it can be exploited to support various large-scale environmental sensing systems.","1633":"Globalization, variation in customer expectations, and the developments connected to Information & Communication Technology are usually considered as the main drivers of changes in Operations Management (OM) strategies by firms in both manufacturing and service industries. Emerging digital technologies, such as Internet of Things or Cloud Computing, represents a novel paradigm that is rapidly affecting on several aspects of everyday-life of private and business users. This paper contributes to extant literature about the relationship between emerging digital technologies and OM, by stressing the value co-creation issue. Specifically, we investigate how emerging digital technologies affect OM through value co-creation in the maritime industry. Our study reports the case of FairWind project, an open technology marine service and graphic user interface enabling sailors to personalize their experience on board through 3rd party boat applications. The case of Fair Wind points out how emerging digital technologies contribute to OM within both organizations and, more in general, maritime industry, as well as the critical role of user's co-creation in defining and managing on-board operations.","1634":"This paper seeks to provide some explanation as to how demand-, supply- and institutions related factors in China have affected the creation and diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT)related products and services. Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms-and underperform-the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.","1635":null,"1637":"Monitoring mechanisms that ensure efficient crop growth are essential on many farms, especially in certain areas of the planet where water is scarce. Most farmers must assume the high cost of the required equipment in order to be able to streamline natural resources on their farms. Considering that many farmers cannot afford to install this equipment, it is necessary to look for more effective solutions that would be cheaper to implement. The objective of this study is to build virtual organizations of agents that can communicate between each other while monitoring crops. A low cost sensor architecture allows farmers to monitor and optimize the growth of their crops by streamlining the amount of resources the crops need at every moment. Since the hardware has limited processing and communication capabilities, our approach uses the PANGEA architecture to overcome this limitation. Specifically, we will design a system that is capable of collecting heterogeneous information from its environment, using sensors for temperature, solar radiation, humidity, pH, moisture and wind. A major outcome of our approach is that our solution is able to merge heterogeneous data from sensors and produce a response adapted to the context. In order to validate the proposed system, we present a case study in which farmers are provided with a tool that allows us to monitor the condition of crops on a TV screen using a low cost device.","1638":"Critical approaches to the smart city concept are used to begin highlighting the promises of makerspaces, that is to say, those emerging urban sites that promote sharing practices; exercise community-based forms of governance; and utilize local manufacturing technologies.

Since its inception in the 90s, the Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control (OPC) protocol has provided open connectivity for monitoring and automation systems. It has been widely used in several environments such as industrial facilities, building and energy automation, engineering education and many others. This paper presents a novel OPC-based architecture to implement automation systems devoted to R&D and educational activities. The proposal is a novel conceptual framework, structured into four functional layers where the diverse components are categorized aiming to foster the systematic design and implementation of automation systems involving OPC communication. Due to the benefits of OPC, the proposed architecture provides features like open connectivity, reliability, scalability, and flexibility. Furthermore, four successful experimental applications of such an architecture, developed at the University of Extremadura (UEX), are reported. These cases are a proof of concept of the ability of this architecture to support interoperability for different domains. Namely, the automation of energy systems like a smart microgrid and photobioreactor facilities, the implementation of a network-accessible industrial laboratory and the development of an educational hardware-in-the-loop platform are described. All cases include a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to automate and control the plant behavior, which exchanges operative data (measurements and signals) with a multiplicity of sensors, instruments and supervisory systems under the structure of the novel OPC architecture. Finally, the main conclusions and open research directions are highlighted.","1645":"For an industry 4.0 environment, the management and offering of services, falls over the construction of a stable and reliable sensor and actuator infrastructure. Industry 4.0 is undergoing increase advancement, infrastructure availability and public acceptance, mainly boosted by the Interconnected Things. The public acceptance drives an increase on investments, carrying an insurgence of companies competing with each other to gain market.

Despite the fact that crowdsensing approaches could be an adequate solution for urban areas, they cannot be implemented in rural environments. Instead, deploying a fleet of UAVs could be considered an acceptable alternative. Embracing this approach, this paper proposes the use of UAVs equipped with off-the-shelf sensors to perform air pollution monitoring tasks. These UAVs are guided by our proposed Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC) algorithm, which is based on a chemotaxis metaheuristic and a local particle swarm optimization strategy. Together, they allow automatically performing the monitoring of a specified area using UAVs. Experimental results show that, when using PdUC, an implicit priority guides the construction of pollution maps by focusing on areas where the pollutants' concentration is higher. This way, accurate maps can be constructed in a faster manner when compared to other strategies. The PdUC scheme is compared against various standard mobility models through simulation, showing that it achieves better performance. In particular, it is able to find the most polluted areas with more accuracy and provides a higher coverage within the time bounds defined by the UAV flight time.","1648":"Automotive instrumentation is an important process to guarantee quality and safety for the drivers and passengers of vehicles. At the same time, it is a time-consuming task, because engineers must setup the system, which includes the passing of cables through the vehicle and the configuration of equipments. A wireless automotive instrumentation system can certainly help on reducing the instrumentation time and its cost. However, it may incur in errors due to the wireless communication between sensors and the base station. In this study, the authors propose a low-cost wireless monitoring system for automotive instrumentation. They compare the proposed system with two commercial instrumentation equipments in terms of features, cost, and precision for monitoring the engine speed. The results indicate that the proposed wireless monitoring system delivers similar performance, but at a lower cost (up to 1114 times cheaper).","1653":"This research paper represents a numerical approximation to non-linear three dimension reaction diffusion equation with non-linear source term from population genetics. Since various initial and boundary value problems exist in three dimension reaction diffusion phenomena, which are studied numerically by different numerical methods, here we use finite difference schemes (Alternating Direction Implicit and Fourth Order Douglas Implicit) to approximate the solution. Accuracy is studied in term of L-2, L-infinity and relative error norms by random selected grids along time levels for comparison with analytical results. The test example demonstrates the accuracy, efficiency and versatility of the proposed schemes.

The library comprises a set of cores that were chosen, together with their parameters and interfacing schemas, based on recommendations from industry and academic SDR experts. The operation of the SDR cores is first validated and then benchmarked against two other cores libraries of a similar type to show that our cores do not take much more logic elements than existing cores and that they support a comparable maximum clock speed. Finally, we propose our design for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and supporting tool-flow, which we are in the process of building using our SDR library and the Delite DSL framework. We intend to take this DSL and supporting framework further to provide a rapid prototyping system for SDR application development to programmers not experienced in HDL coding. We conclude with a summary of the main characteristics of our SDR library and reflect on how our DSL tool-flow could assist other developers working in SDR field.","1657":"The integration of renewable energy sources increases the complexity in maintaining the power grid. In particular, the highly dynamic nature of generation and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy resources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved through demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential overload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of this mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is nevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid and its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an interactive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in order to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze data being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain insights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems. The outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential buildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of hardware measurement units and a management software. The Mjolnir framework, which we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback concepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying disaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily production and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an advisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy feedback. The advisor is estimated leading to a potential of 34% of savings using measurement data from the GREEND dataset.","1658":"White Rabbit technology is capable of delivering sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond precision of synchronization and normal data packets over the fiber network.

The SBS2 system consists of an Android tablet wirelessly connected to a 14-electrode EasyCap headset (cost similar to 300 USD). SBS2 and standard EEG were performed in people with suspected epilepsy in Bhutan (2014-2015), and recordings were interpreted by neurologists. Among 205 participants (54% female, median age 24 years), epileptiform discharges were detected on 14% of SBS2 and 25% of standard EEGs. The SBS2 had 39.2% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI) 25.8%, 53.9%) and 94.8% specificity (95% CI 90.0%, 97.7%) for epileptiform discharges with positive and negative predictive values of 0.71 (95% CI 0.51, 0.87) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.76, 0.89) respectively. 31% of focal and 82% of generalized abnormalities were identified on SBS2 recordings. Cohen's kappa (kappa) for the SBS2 EEG and standard EEG for the epileptiform versus non-epileptiform outcome was kappa = 0.40 (95% CI 0.25, 0.55). No safety or tolerability concerns were reported. Despite limitations in sensitivity, the SBS2 may become a viable supportive test for the capture of epileptiform abnormalities, and extend EEG access to new, especially resource-limited, populations at a reduced cost.","1662":"The Sonic Kayak is a musical instrument used to investigate nature and developed during open hacklab events.

It highlights relationships between communities and corporate firms as nexus for distributed innovation and elaborates how different facets of openness shape the dynamic of the ecosystem. Thus, our model allows for the analysis and comparison of a broad scope of constellations, their particular coordinating mechanisms as well as related advantages and disadvantages.

The global community of makerspaces has evolved quickly and in turn, substantial hype is attributed to its potential for radical sustainable innovation. In this article, we explore this potential in the context of the new 'circular economy' agenda. We focus the research on the critical role of makerspace managers\/founders who are recognised as gatekeepers to circular practices. The research method is action-led including expert interviews (academics and founders\/managers) as well as two generative context-mapping workshops, run at selected makerspaces in collaboration with their founders\/managers. We unearth everyday 'how-to' guidance to interweave circular practices within makerspaces from the outset by: fostering an enabling culture; building local connections; nurturing individual\/community capacities; and stimulating practical know-how. However, while the research reveals immense opportunities to cultivate circular literacy from within makerspaces, the prospects to ask more profound questions about our economy, through makerspace practices, are found to be compromised by day-today concerns. The insights from this research can act as a starting point for future work in this emerging research area.","1670":"In animal behavioral biology, an automated observing\/training system may be useful for several reasons: (a) continuous observation of animals for documentation of specific, irregular events, (b) long-term intensive training of animals in preparation for behavioral experiments, (c) elimination of potential cues and biases induced by humans during training and testing. Here, we describe an open-source-based system named CATOS (Computer Aided Training\/Observing System) developed for such situations. There are several notable features in this system. CATOS is flexible and low cost because it is based on free open-source software libraries, common hardware parts, and open-system electronics based on Arduino. Automated video condensation is applied, leading to significantly reduced video data storage compared to the total active hours of the system. A data-viewing utility program helps a user browse recorded data quickly and more efficiently. With these features, CATOS has the potential to be applied to many different animal species in various environments such as laboratories, zoos, or even private homes. Also, an animal's free access to the device without constraint, and a gamified learning process, enhance the animal's welfare and enriches their environment. As a proof of concept, the system was built and tested with two different species. Initially, the system was tested for approximately 10 months with a domesticated cat. The cat was successfully and fully automatically trained to discriminate three different spoken words. Then, in order to test the system's adaptability to other species and hardware components, we used it to train a laboratory rat for 3 weeks.","1671":"Are the dynamics that underlie commons-based peer production in materially deprived societies the same as those at work in affluent settings? This article contributes to the debate on open development and commons-based peer production by drawing on an in-depth case study of Map Kibera, a popular citizen engagement and citizen mapping project in Nairobi, Kenya. Combining insights from the literature on peer production and participatory development, this examination of the empirical ndings focuses on three dimensions of information co-creation: participant motivations, the relationship between product-oriented versus process-oriented views of participation, and the governance of localized global public goods in economically resource-poor settings.

The system is equipped with a high-precision position transducer that in the test configuration offers a measuring range of 1023mm and an associated accuracy of +\/- 1 mm, and integrates an operating temperature sensor that should allow potential thermal drift that typically affects this kind of systems to be identified and corrected.

Nevertheless, the rapid processing of these sensor data streams still continues to challenge traditional data-handling solutions and new approaches are being requested. We propose a generic answer to this challenge, which has the potential to support any form of distributed real-time analysis. This neutral methodology follows a brokering approach to work with different kinds of data sources and uses web-based standards to achieve interoperability.

The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator.","1685":"A 1-year data set of ground-based GPS signal observations aiming at geometric elevation angles below +2 degrees is analysed.

The measurements confirm the feasibility of open-loop signal tracking down to geometric elevation angles of -1 to -1.5 degrees extending the corresponding closed-loop tracking range by up to 1 degrees. The study is based on the premise that observations of low-elevation events by a ground-based receiver may serve as test cases for space-based radio occultation measurements, even if the latter proceed at a significantly faster temporal scale. The results support the conclusion that the open-loop Doppler model has negligible influence on the derived carrier frequency profile for strong signal-to-noise density ratios above about 30 dB Hz. At lower signal levels, however, the OpenGPS receiver's dual-channel design, which tracks the same signal using two Doppler models differing by 10 Hz, uncovers a notable bias. The repeat patterns of the GPS orbit traces in terms of azimuth angle reveal characteristic signatures in both signal amplitude and Doppler frequency with respect to the topography close to the observation site. Mean vertical refractivity gradients, extracted from ECMWF meteorological fields, correlate weakly to moderately with observed signal amplitude fluctuations at geometric elevation angles between +1 and +2 degrees. Results from multiple phase screen simulations support the interpretation that these fluctuations are at least partly produced by atmospheric multipath; at negative elevation angles diffraction at the ground surface seems to contribute.","1689":"The Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cloud technologies today provide new options for remote measurement data collection, storage and processing.

In Internet user communities, users increasingly review smartphone functions and share information about their experiences such as complaints, problems, and satisfaction, and these user experiences have been fruitful sources for manufacturers that lead to smartphone improvements. Focusing on these user experiences, this paper proposes a systematic roadmapping process including prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements. By prioritising smartphone feature requirements, new and improved versions of smartphones that reflect user needs can be planned based on a product-market roadmap. The systematic approach consists of three parts: user-driven quality function deployment (QFD), a frequent pattern (FP)-tree algorithm, and a product-market roadmap. First, we collected data extracted from text mining in Internet user communities to construct a user-driven QFD. Second, using user experiences related to smartphone features, we applied the FP-tree algorithm to algorithmically derive a priority list of smartphone feature requirements. Finally, based on the result of the FP-tree of smartphones, we proposed guidelines to construct a product-market roadmap. It is expected that a versioning strategy can be formulated through this prioritised product-market roadmap. Furthermore, covering each step from data collection to roadmapping, this study suggests a systematic process for prioritisation of smartphone feature requirements based on user experiences.","1691":"The high stakes of emergent environmental crises, from climate change to widespread toxic exposures, have motivated STS practitioners to innovate methodologically, including leveraging STS scholarship to actively remake environmental scientific practice and technologies. This thematic collection brings together current research that transforms how communities and academics identify, study, and collectively respond to contaminants engendered by the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, including air contamination from hydraulic fracking, marine pollution from petroleum-derived plastics, and hydrocarbon derivatives such as formaldehyde that intoxicate our homes. These interventions make inroads into the \"undone science\" and \"regimes of imperceptibility\" of environmental health crises. Authors, most of whom are practitioners, investigate grassroots methods for collaboratively designing and developing low-cost monitoring tools, crowdsourcing data analysis, and imagining ways of redressing toxicity outside of the idioms of science. Collectively, these articles work towards remaking how knowledge is made about and across industrial systems by networking community grounded approaches for accounting for environmental health issues created by the fossil fuels and allied petrochemical industries.","1693":["Purpose - The national technology accumulation pattern in three- dimensional (3D) printing technology field has not yet been studied until now.

What is the relative impact of 3D printing technology in the worldwide?","Design\/methodology\/approach - Patent bibliometric analysis was used for analyzing and collecting data to find critical information of 3D printing. Some indicators (RTA, FSGI, RII, CV) have been applied in analyzing the national patterns of technology accumulation in developed and developing countries by using patent statistics.","Findings - First, the USA, Japan, and Germany are the leading countries in 3D printing technology, while the technology accumulation patterns of these countries are rather different. Second, Israel and Italy have good performance in the fast- growing technology sub- fields. Third, although the number of patents owned by developing countries, such as China and Russia, is not few, the citations received by these patents are low.","Research limitations\/implications - A limitation of this study is that technological development can be reflected by many indicators and patent statistic is merely one reflection form. This study just analyzes the 3D printing technology development from the perspective of patent statistic, the authors would like to continue the comprehensive analysis with the other data indicators in a future study.","Originality\/value - The national technology accumulation pattern in 3D printing technology field has not yet been studied until now.

Living labs are environments that can support public open innovation processes.","This article makes a practical contribution to understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation. The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornelia and the network of fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries.

In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia, such a physiomarker is missing.","MethodsPallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlated with clinical improvement.","ResultsDystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (=0.4, p=0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (=0.5, p=0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (=0.23, p=0.002), which coincided with 3 previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long-term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (=0.38, p=0.018).","InterpretationOur findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON\/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW\/cm(2) for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW\/cm(2). The fans and the ON\/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 degrees C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Consuming minimum gasoline during the trip is a common goal for most energy management controllers. To achieve these objectives, an intelligent energy management controller for EREV based on dynamic programming and neural networks (IEMC_NN) is proposed. The power demand split ratio between the extender and battery are optimized by DP, and the control objectives are presented as a cost function. The online controller is trained by neural networks. Three trained controllers, constructing the controller library in IEMC_NN, are obtained from training three typical lengths of the driving cycle. To determine an appropriate NN controller for different driving distance purposes, the selection module in IEMC_NN is developed based on the remaining battery energy and the driving distance to the charging station. Three simulation conditions are adopted to validate the performance of IEMC_NN. They are target driving distance information, known and unknown, changing the destination during the trip. Simulation results using these simulation conditions show that the IEMC_NN had better fuel economy than the charging deplete\/charging sustain (CD\/CS) algorithm. More significantly, with known driving distance information, the battery SOC controlled by IEMC_NN can just reach the lower bound as the EREV arrives at the charging station, which was also feasible when the driver changed the destination during the trip.","1703":"This paper presents a technical overview of Team DRC-Hubo@UNLV's approach to the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals (DRC-Finals). The Finals required a robotic platform that was robust and reliable in both hardware and software to complete tasks in 60 min under degraded communication. With this point of view, Team DRC-Hubo@UNLV integrated methods and algorithms previously verified, validated, and widely used in the robotics community. For the communication aspect, a common shared memory approach that the team adopted to enable efficient data communication under the DARPA controlled network is described.

A longitudinal ethnographic study in a Fab Lab in a European design school examined the Lab's ideology building, how ideals were enacted and where compromises were visible. Environmental issues were intertwined with other ideological concerns, but they were rarely promoted in their own right.

Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization.","1708":"The current standard protocols for characterizing the optogenetic circuit of bacterial cells using flow cytometry in light tubes and light exposure of culture plates are tedious, labor-intensive, and cumbersome. In this work, we engineer a bioreactor with working volume of similar to 10 mL for in vivo real-time optogenetic characterization of E. coli with a CcaS-CcaR light-sensing system. In the bioreactor, optical density measurements, reporter protein fluorescence detection, and light input stimuli are provided by four light-emitting diode sources and two photodetectors. Once calibrated, the device can cultivate microbial cells and record their growth and gene expression without human intervention.

This paper presents a highly efficient computer vision algorithm called Edge-FS for the determination of velocity and depth. It runs at 20 Hz on a 4 g stereo camera with an embedded STM32F4 microprocessor (168 MHz, 192 kB) and uses edge distributions to calculate optical flow and stereo disparity. The stereo-based distance estimates are used to scale the optical flow in order to retrieve the drone's velocity. The velocity and depth measurements are used for fully autonomous flight of a 40 g pocket drone only relying on on-board sensors. This method allows the MAV to control its velocity and avoid obstacles.","1713":"This paper presents an analysis of data collected through the Waterloo WeBike project: a field trial in which over 30 sensor-equipped electric bicycles (e-bikes) were given to members of the University of Waterloo for personal use. Our dataset includes e-bike trips and battery charging sessions spanning nearly three years, from summer 2014 until spring 2017. We also conducted three surveys both before and during the trial. Our main findings were that the primary purpose of the e-bikes in our trial was for commuting, with most trips lasting less than 20 minutes and most trips taking place in the summer months. Our battery charging analysis revealed no evidence of range anxiety, and our analysis of survey results showed little correlation between anticipated and actual use. Furthermore, when asked about their opinions about various modes of transportation, our participants rated regular bicycles higher than e-bikes even after becoming familiar with e-bikes through the field trial. Based on our analysis, we draw several conclusions, including the fact that the general population in Canada is still unaware of e-bikes and their potential. Moreover, e-bike manufacturers should target sales to nonbike users, such as seniors, rather than trying to displace sales of regular bicycles.","1714":"Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source.","1719":"Tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to perform vertical take-off and landing and their high-speed cruising abilities, thereby presenting broad application prospects. Considering portability and applications in tasks characterized by constrained or small scope areas, this article presents a compact tricopter configuration tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with full modes of flight from the rotor mode to the fixed-wing mode and vice versa. The unique multiple modes make the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle a multi-input multi-output, non-affine, multi-channel cross coupling, and nonlinear system. Considering these characteristics, a control allocation method is designed to make the controller adaptive to the full modes of flight. To reduce the cost, the accurate dynamic model of the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle is not obtained, so a full-mode flight strategy is designed in view of this situation. An autonomous flight test was conducted, and the results indicate the satisfactory performance of the control allocation method and flight strategy.","1720":"White or polychromatic light sources are vastly abundant in nature and lie in our most basic understanding of the theory of light, beginning from stars like our Sun and extending to every common household light bulb or street lamp.

The benefits of a flipped classroom include increased student motivation, differentiating instruction, self-pacing lessons and mastery learning, increased collaboration and instant feedback for formative assessment. Although limited research has been conducted regarding students with learning difficulties in inclusive settings using a flipped learning model, initial research indicates flipping a classroom can be beneficial.

The principles of non-formal education aligned with the concept of constructionism are used to create an experimental educational scenario focused on geocultural tourism for persons with visual impairments. This paper documents our experience and presents our findings- from a 25-day long project, which took place in Zagori, northwestern Greece. 11 high school students from Portugal designed and manufactured natural and cultural heritage artifacts carrying messages in the Braille language. The objects were then handed to people with visual impairments with a twofold aim. First, to enable the communication among persons with and without visual impairments; and, second, to empower students to participate in training projects through open educational procedures. We conclude that open educational practices can boost students' active engagement in educational processes. Finally, 3D printing encourages a meaningful communication among people with and without visual impairments via the tangible exploration of geocultural components. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Brighton trial, three-quarters of those who were loaned an e-bike used them at least once a week. Across the sample as a whole, average usage was in the order of 1520 miles per week, and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20%. At the end of the trial, 38% participants expected to cycle more in the future, and at least 70% said that they would like to have an e-bike available for use in the future, and would cycle more if this was the case. This is consistent with the results of the European literature which shows that when e-bikes are made available, they get used; that a proportion of e-bike trips typically substitutes for car use; and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e-bike use, or cycling more generally.

However, in agriculture fields the temperature significantly changes from time to time during 24 h, which affects response of the soil moisture sensor. This paper, analyzes and models the error produced in the response of the DPHP sensors due to variation of the soil temperature. For this purpose, first effect of the soil temperature on the response of the sensor is studied using eight different soil samples. Accordingly, the existing soil moisture model, used for DPHP devices, is modified and used for the temperature compensation. A low power DPHP sensor comprising one heater probe and one temperature sensor probe, placed 0.003 m apart, is fabricated. A low power, automated system, dissipating average power of 30 mW, is also developed for the field measurements to validate the proposed model. The developed system is deployed in the field and soil moisture is measured for 38 h at every 1 h interval. Field measurements indicates that volumetric moisture content measured without temperature compensation leads to error of about 3% and with temperature compensation the error is reduced to 0.5%.

An aerodynamic shape optimisation code, which uses a viscous two-dimensional panel method formulation coupled with a non-linear vortex lattice algorithm and a sequential quadratic programming optimisation routine, is used to solve a drag minimisation problem to determine the optimal values of wing span for various speeds of the vehicle's flight envelope while subject to geometric constraints. Structural design is performed using the finite element method for static analysis where the particular interface between wing parts is conveniently modelled. A full-scale prototype is built for ground testing the wing\/actuator system. The wing is built in composite materials and an electro-mechanical actuation mechanism is developed using an aluminium rack and pinion system driven by two servomotors. Bench tests, performed to evaluate wing under load, showed that the system is capable of performing the required extension\/retraction cycles and is suitable to be installed on a UAV airframe fully instrumented for evaluating the VSW concept prototype in flight. The data collected from the performed flights showed full functionality of the VSW and its aerodynamic improvements over a conventional fixed wing for the higher speed end of the flight envelope.","1752":"Dual probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensors are economical solutions for soil moisture measurements.

Accordingly, the existing soil moisture model, used for DPHP devices, is modified and used for the temperature compensation. A low power DPHP sensor comprising one heater probe and one temperature sensor probe, placed 0.003 m apart, is fabricated. A low power, automated system, dissipating average power of 30 mW, is also developed for the field measurements to validate the proposed model. The developed system is deployed in the field and soil moisture is measured for 38 h at every 1 h interval. Field measurements indicates that volumetric moisture content measured without temperature compensation leads to error of about 3% and with temperature compensation the error is reduced to 0.5%.

An aerodynamic shape optimisation code, which uses a viscous two-dimensional panel method formulation coupled with a non-linear vortex lattice algorithm and a sequential quadratic programming optimisation routine, is used to solve a drag minimisation problem to determine the optimal values of wing span for various speeds of the vehicle's flight envelope while subject to geometric constraints. Structural design is performed using the finite element method for static analysis where the particular interface between wing parts is conveniently modelled. A full-scale prototype is built for ground testing the wing\/actuator system. The wing is built in composite materials and an electro-mechanical actuation mechanism is developed using an aluminium rack and pinion system driven by two servomotors. Bench tests, performed to evaluate wing under load, showed that the system is capable of performing the required extension\/retraction cycles and is suitable to be installed on a UAV airframe fully instrumented for evaluating the VSW concept prototype in flight. The data collected from the performed flights showed full functionality of the VSW and its aerodynamic improvements over a conventional fixed wing for the higher speed end of the flight envelope.","1756":"The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a eukaryotic serine\/threonine protein kinase that functions in two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, to regulate growth and metabolism(1,2). GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors, nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important(3) but poorly understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast, glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity(4)) triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain). Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1 inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and\/or disassembly of higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of protein kinases.","1758":"This article contends that technopopulism is a discursive formation that emerges from the convergence of two preexisting discourses: populism and technolibertarianism. Whereas these discourses are historically distinct the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 wave of struggles precipitated the political conditions for their intersection. Such convergence produces both tensions and possibilities. On the one hand, technopopulism engenders a radically participatory model of democracy, which is ultimately anti-institutional as citizens cooperate and engage in sophisticated decision-making without the mediation of professional politicians. On the other hand, the more electorally successful technopopulist parties are led by charismatic leaders who synthesize the positions that emerge from the netroots to mobilize them against the establishment. These two seemingly contradictory aspects precipitate in two variants of technopopulism: a leaderless-technocratic variant, which is derived from the open source mode of governance and from early experiments of the Global Justice Movement in networked self-government; and a leaderist-populist variant, which is more strictly focused on the electoral competition as an intrinsically hegemonic practice. The article concludes with a reflection on the discursive complementarity of these two variants.","1759":"Characterizing dementia is a global challenge in supporting personalized health care. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a promising tool to support the diagnosis and evaluation of abnormalities in the human brain. The EEG sensors record the brain activity directly with excellent time resolution. In this study, EEG sensor with 19 electrodes were used to test the background activities of the brains of five vascular dementia (VaD), 15 stroke-related patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 15 healthy subjects during a working memory (WM) task. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to enhance the recorded EEG signals using a novel technique that combines automatic independent component analysis (AICA) and wavelet transform (WT), that is, the AICA-WT technique; second, it aims to extract and investigate the spectral features that characterize the post-stroke dementia patients compared to the control subjects. The proposed AICA-WT technique is a four-stage approach. In the first stage, the independent components (ICs) were estimated. In the second stage, three-step artifact identification metrics were applied to detect the artifactual components. The components identified as artifacts were marked as critical and denoised through DWT in the third stage. In the fourth stage, the corrected ICs were reconstructed to obtain artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the proposed AICA-WT technique was compared with those of two other techniques based on AICA andWT denoising methods using cross-correlation XCorr and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The AICA-WT technique exhibited the best artifact removal performance. The assumption that there would be a deceleration of EEG dominant frequencies in VaD and MCI patients compared with control subjects was assessed with AICA-WT (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Therefore, this study may provide information on post-stroke dementia particularly VaD and stroke-related MCI patients through spectral analysis of EEG background activities that can help to provide useful diagnostic indexes by using EEG signal processing.","1760":"This paper presents a novel ultrawideband wireless spread spectrum millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel sounder that supports both a wideband sliding correlator mode and a real-time spread spectrum mode, also known as wideband correlation or direct correlation. Both channel sounder modes are capable of absolute propagation delay (time of flight) measurements with up to 1 GHz of radio frequency null-to-null bandwidth, and can measure multipath with a 2-ns time resolution. The sliding correlator configuration facilitates long-distance measurements with angular spread and delay spread for up to 185 dB of maximum measurable path loss. The real-time spread spectrum mode is shown to support short-range, small-scale temporal, and Doppler measurements (minimum snapshot sampling interval of 32.753 aes) with a substantial dynamic fading range of 40 dB for human blockage and dynamic urban scenarios. The channel sounder uses field programmable gate arrays, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, and low-phase-noise rubidium standard references for frequency\/time synchronization and absolute time delay measurements. Using propagation theory, several methods are presented here to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the channel sounder, and an improved diffraction model for human blockage, based on the METIS model but now including directional antenna gains, is developed from measurements using the channel sounder. The mmWave channel sounder described here may be used for accurate spatial and temporal ray-tracing calibration, to identify individual multipath components, to measure antenna patterns, for constructing spatial profiles of mmWave channels, and for developing statistical channel impulse response models in time and space.","1761":null,"1763":"Precision and personalized medicine will be increasingly based on the integration of various type of information, particularly electronic health records and genome sequences. The availability of cheap genome sequencing services and the information interoperability will increase the role of online bioinformatics analysis. Being on the Internet poses constant threats to security and privacy. While we are connected and we share information, websites and internet services collect various types of personal data with or without the user consent. It is likely that genomics will merge with the internet culture of connectivity. This process will increase incidental findings, exposure and vulnerability. Here we discuss the social vulnerability owing to the genome and Internet combined security and privacy weaknesses. This urges more efforts in education and social awareness on how biomedical data are analysed and transferred through the internet and how inferential methods could integrate information from different sources. We propose that digital social platforms, used for raising collective awareness in different fields, could be developed for collaborative and bottom-up efforts in education. In this context, bioinformaticians could play a meaningful role in mitigating the future risk of digital-genomic divide.","1764":"Data centers have been evolved from a passive element of compute infrastructure to become an active, core part of any ICT solution. In particular, modular data centers (MDCs), which are a promising design approach to improve resiliency of data centers, can play a key role in deploying ICT infrastructure in remote and inhospitable environments in order to take advantage of low temperatures and hydro- and wind-electric capabilities. This is because of capability of the modular data centers to survive even in lack of continuous on site maintenance and support. The most critical part of a data center is its network fabric that could impede the whole system even if all other components are fully functional, assuming that other analyses have been already performed to ensure the reliability of the underlying infrastructure and support systems. In this work, a complete failure analysis of modular data centers using failure models of various components including servers, switches, and links is performed using a proposed Monte-Carlo approach. The proposed Monte-Carlo approach, which is based on the concept of snapshots, allows us to effectively calculate the performance of a design along its lifespan even up to the terminal stages. To show the capabilities of the proposed approach, various network topologies, such as FatTree, BCube, MDCube, and their modifications, are considered. The performance and also the lifespan of each topology design in the presence of failures of their components are studied against the topology parameters.","1765":"In order to develop a valid wireless Internet of things system, a wireless Internet of things framework based on mobile Internet is designed. The architecture of the Internet of things determines the architecture of the Internet of things business platform. There is no uniform standard for the architecture of the Internet of things service platform. The Internet of things business platform is mostly in an isolated state. The platform uses the common information management platform of Internet websites to manage mobile internet. Combined with the technologies of perception, identification and network transmission in the Internet of things technology, it is a content management Web management information system with both B\/S (Browser\/Server) and C\/S structure (Client\/Server). The platform can operate anywhere, and can give full play to the processing capacity of the client PC, and greatly reduce the application server running data load. The experimental results show that compared with the centralized database system, in the same piece of redundant condition, when the test table data is greater than the 1 million and the concurrent number is 100, the distributed database system has shorter concurrent query time and faster system response rate. Based on the above finding, it is concluded that wireless Internet of things technology based on mobile Internet will promote the development of the whole logistics industry and other related industries.","1767":"Energy planning and policy development require an in-depth assessment of energy resources and long-term demand forecast estimates. Pakistan, unfortunately, lacks reliable data on its energy resources as well do not have dependable long-term energy demand forecasts. As a result, the policy makers could not come up with an effective energy policy in the history of the country. Energy demand forecast has attained greatest ever attention in the perspective of growing population and diminishing fossil fuel resources. In this study, Pakistan's energy demand forecast for electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and LPG across all the sectors of the economy have been undertaken. Three different energy demand forecasting methodologies, i.e., Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Holt-Winter and Long-range Energy Alternate Planning (LEAP) model were used. The demand forecast estimates of each of these methods were compared using annual energy demand data. The results of this study suggest that ARIMA is more appropriate for energy demand forecasting for Pakistan compared to Holt-Winter model and LEAP model. It is estimated that industrial sector's demand shall be highest in the year 2035 followed by transport and domestic sectors. The results further suggest that energy fuel mix will change considerably, such that oil will be the most highly consumed energy form (38.16%) followed by natural gas (36.57%), electricity (16.22%), coal (7.52%) and LPG (1.52%) in 2035. In view of higher demand forecast of fossil fuels consumption, this study recommends that government should take the initiative for harnessing renewable energy resources for meeting future energy demand to not only avert huge import bill but also achieving energy security and sustainability in the long run.","1769":"The LHC Schottky beam diagnostic system has the potential to measure beam parameters such as tune, chromaticity and momentum spread in a non-invasive way. It does so by detecting beam induced signals at 4.8 GHz, and extracting the characteristic modulation caused by incoherent motion of particles within a bunch. The system was commissioned in 2011 and provided satisfactory beam-parameter measurements during LHC Run I for lead-ions. However, for protons its usability was substantially limited due to strong interfering common-mode signals. The system was upgraded with optimized traveling-wave pick-ups and an improved microwave signal path. Design and operational aspects for the complete system are shown, and the results from measurements with LHC beams in Run II are presented and discussed. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

As a common infrastructure to accommodate diversified communication services with drastic traffic growth, it is necessary not only to continuously convey the growing traffic but also to achieve high end-to-end communication quality and availability and provide flexible controllability in cooperation with service layer networks. To achieve high-speed and large-capacity transport systems cost-effectively, system configuration, applied devices, and the manufacturing process have recently begun to change, and the cause of failure or performance degradation has become more complex and diversified. The drastic traffic growth and pattern change of service networks increase the frequency and scale of transport-capacity increase and transport-network reconfiguration in cooperation with service networks. Therefore, drastic traffic growth affects both optical-transport-system configuration and its operational cycles. In this paper, we give an overview of the operational problems emerging in current nationwide optical transport networks, and based on trends analysis for system configuration and network-control schemes, we propose a vision of the future nationwide optical-transport-network architecture expressed using five target features.","1775":"When two eyes are simultaneously stimulated by two inconsistent images, the observer's perception switches between the two images every few seconds such that only one image is perceived at a time. This phenomenon is named binocular rivalry (BR). However, sometimes the perceived image is a piecemeal mixed of two stimuli known as piecemeal perceptions. In this study, a BR task was designed in which orthogonal gratings are presented to the two eyes. The subjects were trained to report 3 states: dominant perceptions (two state matching to perceived grating orientation) and the piecemeal perceptions (third state). We explored the scale-freeness of the BR percept durations considering the two dominant monocular states as well as the piecemeal transition state using detrended fluctuation analysis. Our results reproduced the previous finding of memory in the perceptual switches between the monocular perception states. Moreover, we showed that such memory also exists in the transitory periods of dichoptic piecemeal perceptions. These results support our hypothesis that the pool of unstable piecemeal perceptions could be regarded as separate multiple low-depth basin in the perceptual state landscape. Likewise, the transitions from these piecemeal state basins and stable monocular state basins are faced with resistance. Therefore there is inertia and memory (i.e. positive serial correlation) for the piecemeal dichoptic perception states as well as the monocular states.","1776":"In this paper, we present a framework to expand the design language used to articulate form properties and types of feedback that happen between children's actions and the intended functionality of maker technologies. Based on field observations in Danish schools we analyze children's (aged 11-14 years old) interactions with three maker technologies used to work through design processes in school maker settings. Our findings are beneficial on three factors for designers, researchers and teachers involved in work within maker contexts. (1) Reflections on form properties of maker technologies, (2) analysis of relationship between user action and technology function (action-function couplings), and (3) how this relates to feedback when children use these technologies to design digital prototypes. Designers can use the presented framework to improve existing, or prepare them for future designs. Researchers can use the expanded design language to analyze maker technologies in the context of school maker settings. Finally, teachers can make better decisions on how and when to use different maker technologies when school children work through design processes. (Do it yourself\/together.) (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed technique is independent of the scale factor in case of planar observed scene and does not require a priori knowledge of the scene. Image moments of virtual objects, i.e. sets of classical image features such as corners collected online, are employed as the sole correcting information to be fed back to the estimator. Experimental results performed with a quadrotor equipped with a fisheye camera highlight the potential of the proposed approach.","1779":"Accurate parameterization of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is necessary for optimizing irrigation scheduling and avoiding costs associated with over-irrigation (water expense, loss of water productivity, energy costs, and pollution) or with under-irrigation (crop stress and suboptimal yields or quality). ET0 is often estimated using the FAO-56 method with meteorological data gathered over a reference surface, usually short grass. However, the density of suitable ET0 stations is often low relative to the microclimatic variability of many arid and semi-arid regions, leading to a potentially inaccurate ET0 for irrigation scheduling. In this study, we investigated multiple ET0 products from six meteorological stations, a satellite ET0 product, and integration (merger) of two stations' data in Southern California, USA. We evaluated ET0 against lysimetric ET observations from two lysimeter systems (weighing and volumetric) and two crops (wine grapes and Jerusalem artichoke) by calculating crop ET (ETc) using crop coefficients for the lysimetric crops with the different ET0. ETc calculated with ET0 products that incorporated field-specific wind speed had closer agreement with lysimetric ET, with RMSE reduced by 36 and 45% for grape and Jerusalem artichoke, respectively, with on-field anemometer data compared to wind data from the nearest station. The results indicate the potential importance of on-site meteorological sensors for ET0 parameterization; particularly where microclimates are highly variable and\/or irrigation water is expensive or scarce.","1780":"The smart grid is a complex and interconnected system where actions and events in one part of the system affect operations elsewhere. In order to perform a rigorous analysis, a common and deterministic timing reference is required. This paper addresses this need, using as use case the substation automation system, a key element of the smart grid, where utilities, classically, have opted for a satellite clock providing a timing signal and different ways to distribute it through the substation. This paper proposes an appropriate solution for the substation needs presenting the implementation details, the analysis of the system reliability, safety, and security together with promising results and novel mechanisms for providing timing on the grid.","1782":"This paper presents the analysis and performance evaluation of an embedded prototype to control the access of people to companies or institutions by using short range wireless technologies, like NFC and RFID.

With this proposal, we seek to optimize the time in the identification transactions and improve the security in places where the manual access is carried out. This work is an answer to the need of an adequate management of the access control of the Technological Faculty personnel in the Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas in Bogota: the chosen scenario for testing our proposal.","1784":"Existing studies on data acquisition in vehicular networks often take the mobile vehicular nodes as data carriers. However, their autonomous movements, limited resources and security risks impact the quality of services. In this article, we propose a data acquisition model using stable matching of bipartite graph in cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems, namely, DAS. Contents are distributed to roadside units, while vehicular nodes support supplementary storage. The original distribution problem is formulated as a stable matching problem of bipartite graph, where the data and the storage cells compose two sides of vertices. Regarding the factors relevant with the access ratio and delay, the preference rankings for contents and roadside units are calculated, respectively. With a multi-replica preprocessing algorithm to handle the potential one-to-many mapping, the matching problem is addressed in polynomial time. In addition, vehicular nodes carry and forward assistant contents to deliver the failed packets because of bandwidth competition. Furthermore, an incentive strategy is put forward to boost the vehicle cooperation and to achieve a fair bandwidth allocation at roadside units. Experiments show that DAS achieves a high access ratio and a small storage cost with an acceptable delay.","1785":"Optogenetic tools allow regulation of cellular processes with light, which can be delivered with spatiotemporal resolution. In previous work, we used cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) and CIB1, Arabidopsis proteins that interact upon light illumination, to regulate transcription with light in yeast. While adopting this approach to regulate transcription in mammalian cells, we observed light-dependent redistribution and clearing of CRY2-tethered proteins within the nucleus. The nuclear clearing phenotype was dependent on the presence of a dimerization domain contained within the CRY2-fused transcriptional activators. We used this knowledge to develop two different approaches to regulate cellular protein levels with light: a system using CRY2 and CIB1 to induce protein expression with light through stimulation of transcription, and a system using CRY2 and a LOV-fused degron to simultaneously block transcription and deplete protein levels with light. These tools will allow precise, bi-directional control of gene expression in a variety of cells and model systems.","1786":"Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures that protect chromosome ends from DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA rearrangements. The telomeric shelterin protein TRF2 suppresses the DDR, and this function has been attributed to its abilities to trigger t-loop formation or prevent massive decompaction and loss of density of telomeric chromatin. Here, we applied stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to measure the sizes and shapes of functional human telomeres of different lengths and dysfunctional telomeres that elicit a DDR. Telomeres have an ovoid appearance with considerable plasticity in shape. Examination of many telomeres demonstrated that depletion of TRF2, TRF1, or both affected the sizes of only a small subset of telomeres. Costaining of telomeres with DDR markers further revealed that the majority of DDR signaling telomeres retained a normal size. Thus, DDR signaling at telomeres does not require decompaction. We propose that telomeres are monitored by the DDR machinery in the absence of telomere expansion and that the DDR is triggered by changes at the molecular level in structure and protein composition.","1788":"In this paper, we present a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system which integrates measurements from multiple cameras to achieve robust pose tracking for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown complex environments. We analyze the iterative optimizations for pose tracking and map refinement of visual SLAM in multi-camera cases. The analysis ensures the soundness and accuracy of each optimization update. A well-known monocular visual SLAM system is extended to utilize two cameras with non-overlapping fields of view (FOVs) in the final implementation. The resulting visual SLAM system enables autonomous navigation of an MAV in complex scenarios. The theory behind this system can easily be extended to multi-camera configurations, when the onboard computational capability allows this. For operations in large-scale environments, we modify the resulting visual SLAM system to be a constant-time robust visual odometry. To form a full visual SLAM system, we further implement an efficient back-end for loop closing. The back-end maintains a keyframe-based global map, which is also used for loop-closure detection. An adaptive-window pose-graph optimization method is proposed to refine keyframe poses of the global map and thus correct pose drift that is inherent in the visual odometry. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed visual SLAM system for applications onboard of MAVs in experiments with both autonomous and manual flights. The pose tracking results are compared with ground truth data provided by an external tracking system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Prosumers create new technology solutions, collaborate with other consumers, and share their ideas, knowledge and inventions with peers in online communities they have formed. These activities by consumers support the proliferation of sustainable energy technology in contexts where institutions and technology characteristics are not yet fully developed for the wide proliferation of S-RET. The issues in the market diffusion of cleaner micro-generation technologies are not limited to \"barriers\" or \"challenges\" to top-down diffusion. Given that prosumers do many things to aid the diffusion of S-RET, we investigated how consumer created technology solutions diffused: their existence adds to solution variety, but do others then pick this up? The findings show that 2.7% of the consumer innovations diffused through commercial channels and 8.2% diffused through their straight adoption by peers. A significant share of projects (34.1%) were part of \"innovative peer diffusion\" adaptations and further modifications carried out among peers. Prosumers' efforts to diffuse their solutions remain low level and indicate directions for platform development by which prosumer solutions may spread more widely.

To this end, windbreaks composed of plastic meshes (7.5 m long and 0.7 m tall) were used. Windbreaks are a good means to reduce wind erosion, as they produce a positive effect on the characteristics of air currents that are related to wind erosion processes. Due to their ease of installation and dismantling, plastic meshes are widely used in areas where they are not required permanently. In our study, the use of a mesh of 13 x 30 threads cm(-2) and 39 % porosity resulted in an average reduction of 85 % in face velocity at a height of 0.4 m and a distance of 1 m from the windbreak. The turbulence intensity i increased behind the windbreak because the reduction of mean of air speed on the leeside caused by the flow of air through the windbreak. Fluctuation levels, however, remained stable. The mean values of turbulence kinetic energy k decreased by 65 % to 86 % at a distance of 1 m from the windbreak and at a height of 0.4 m. The windbreak reduces erosion and sediment transportation 2 m downwind (2.9 times the windbreak height). Nevertheless, sediment transportation was not reduced at a height of 1.0 m and the effect of the windbreak was not observed at a distance of 6 m downwind (8.6 m times the windbreak height).","1791":"We describe the research trajectories associated with S-D Logic and the scholarly activity it encompasses across a breadth of disciplines by conducting a bibliometric analysis of a body of literature citing two fundamental S-D Logic publications between 2004-2014. The bibliometric analysis reveals four pertinent research trajectories: Value co-creation, Resources (incl. integration), Brands, and Innovation. These empirical findings are supported by qualitative insights and projections obtained from structured interviews with S-D Logic scholars using the Delphi method, which identifies ten research trajectories: Actors, Context, Innovation, Institutions, Markets, Resources, Service, Systems, Value co-creation, and Value propositions. The main tenets, relevant literature, and syntheses of research questions for the aforementioned research trajectories are provided. Results indicate that the scientific community is evaluating fundamental ontological and epistemological questions of S-D Logic. Emergent themes (complex and fractal phenomena, generic conceptualizations, technological innovation and democratization processes, and institutionalization practices) are discussed. The results provide insight into the development of paradigms in the managerial sciences. The delineation of the paradigm's thematic boundaries, its emergent themes, and identification of central research trajectories informs an advanced understanding of the nature of economic exchange and value creation for both practitioners and the managerial sciences, thus aiding the transdisciplinary production of knowledge.

Various proprietary \"cold storage\" services, based on spun-down disks or tapes, offer reduced tariffs but also lead to extended times to first access. One way to improve cold-storage systems is to build them on a file system that allows for the I\/O patterns of storage devices. We have developed a cold-storage test-bed for mobile messenger services, which takes into account the power consumption of each hard disk in the system. We analyzed a trace of I\/O requests from a messenger service and found that they had a strongly skewed Zipfian distribution and that most of the stored data is cold. Current cloud benchmarking tools cannot reproduce this pattern of I\/O. Therefore, we have developed a tool for benchmarking cold-storage systems that emulates this type of long-tail distribution and can contribute to reducing the power consumption of mobile messenger services.","1794":"WILGA annual symposium on advanced photonic and electronic systems has been organized by young scientist for young scientists since two decades.

Several symmetric based key distribution protocols are already proposed, but most of them are not scalable, yet vulnerable to a small number of compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable key management and distribution framework, named KMMR, for large scale WSNs. The KMMR contributions are three fold. First, it performs lightweight local processes orchestrated into upward and downward tiers. Second, it limits the impact of compromised nodes to only local links. Third, KMMR performs efficient secure node addition and revocation. The security analysis shows that KMMR withstands several known attacks. We implemented KMMR using the NesC language and experimented on Telosb motes. Performance evaluation using the TOSSIM simulator shows that KMMR is scalable, provides an excellent key connectivity and allows a good resilience, yet it ensures both forward and backward secrecy. For a WSN comprising 961 sensor nodes monitoring a 60 hectares agriculture field, KMMR requires around 2.5 seconds to distribute all necessary keys, and attains a key connectivity above 96% and a resilience approaching 100%. Quantitative comparisons to earlier work show that KMMR is more efficient in terms of computational complexity, required storage space and communication overhead.","1801":"Colocated 4x4 multiple-input multiple-output measurements at 2.55 and 24 GHz are presented for two university buildings consisting of classrooms and offices. Link gain in hallways and connected laboratories looks similar at the two frequencies when the effect of lower effective receive antenna aperture with increasing frequency is removed. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation through a wall or around hallway corners exhibits approximately 5-20 dB (11 dB on average) greater loss beyond the 20 dB aperture loss at 24 GHz compared to that at 2.55 GHz. Fixed directional antennas increase path loss (PL) by an average of 13 dB when misaligned. Capacity for normalized signal-to-noise ratio is very similar in the two bands and is close to that for the optimal independent identically distributed case, indicating sufficient multipath for spatial multiplexing at 24 GHz. A ray-tracing study suggests that material loss must increase from 2.55 to 24 GHz to correctly predict the higher PL at 24 GHz in severely obstructed scenarios, indicating a need for future material characterization in high microwave bands. The results suggest that 24 GHz is a viable option to replace medium-range (10-30 m) NLOS wireless services currently operating at 2.4 GHz.","1803":"A planar travel distance sensor (two-dimensional sensor) was developed for a mobile robot in sandy terrain. The sensor system uses an optical flow device integrated into a small module with a simple configuration. The system achieves a high sampling rate on the order of milliseconds as well as precise measurement on a sub-millimeter order. Its performance was evaluated experimentally for measurement accuracy and repeatability, velocity response, robustness at varied heights with respect to terrain, and terrain surface characteristics. The experimental results confirm that the two-dimensional sensor system is accurate, having an error of distance traveled of less than a few percent, and that it possesses a wide dynamic range for the robot's traveling velocity. This paper also discusses the applicability of the two-dimensional sensor for practical scenarios on the basis of the experimental findings.","1804":"This paper presents a dynamic image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control law for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a single fixed on-board camera. The motion control problem is to regulate the relative position and yaw of the vehicle to a moving planar target located within the camera's field of view. The control law is termed dynamic as it's based on the dynamics of the vehicle. To simplify the kinematics and dynamics, the control law relies on the notion of a virtual camera and image moments as visual features. The convergence of the closed-loop is proven to be globally asymptotically stable for a horizontal target. In the case of nonhorizontal targets, we modify the control using a homography decomposition. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the control law's performance.","1808":"Flying in unknown environments may lead to unforeseen collisions, which may cause serious damage to the robot and\/or its environment. In this context, fast and robust collision detection combined with safe reaction is, therefore, essential and may be achieved using external wrench information. Also, deliberate physical interaction requires a control loop designed for such a purpose and may require knowledge of the contact wrench. In principle, the external wrench may be measured or estimated. Whereas measurement poses large demands on sensor equipment, additional weight, and overall system robustness, in this paper we present a novel model-based method for external wrench estimation in flying robots. The algorithm is based on the onboard inertial measurement unit and the robot's dynamics model only. We design admittance and impedance controllers that use this estimate for sensitive and robust physical interaction. Furthermore, the performance of several collision detection and reaction schemes is investigated in order to ensure collision safety. The identified collision location and associated normal vector located on the robot's convex hull may then be used for sensorless tactile sensing. Finally, a low-level collision reflex layer is provided for flying robots when obstacle avoidance fails, also under wind influence. Our experimental and simulation results show evidence that the methodologies are easily implemented and effective in practice.","1809":"The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.","1810":"Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.","1812":["To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manuf acturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.","This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them.","Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future."],"1814":"Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.","1816":null,"1817":"As a growing number of companies reject intellectual property (IP) monopoly-based business models to embrace libre product development of free and open source hardware and software, there is an urgent need to refurbish the instruments of university-corporate research partnerships. These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research. Under the SLRA, university researchers can spend more time innovating for the same investment.","1821":"We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments.","1822":"Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17-0.63% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65-9.38% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.","1824":null,"1825":"In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.","1827":"Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware co-design leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.","1830":"We present an activity framed within the European Robotics Week event. Robotics and computational practice are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. A modular and adaptive hands-on workshop is described in detail. The workshop is based on multiplatform educational robotics content as a first step into the robotics world. Three educational tools are used to introduce examples of robotics applications. The operational details, materials, and examples of activities for selected modules are presented with the expectation that all teachers can adapt these activities to their classes. Despite the small number of students, the experience delivered results that might be useful for other instructors to promote workshops with similar or identical content to generate further benefits. This study demonstrates that it is important to combine theory and practice and include fun tasks that intertwine the challenges of applying theory to problem solving. Furthermore, the results show how the same content can be deployed using three different robotics education tools.","1831":"Supported by easier and cheaper access to tools and expanding communities, maker cultures are pointing towards the ideas of (almost) everyone designing, creating, producing and distributing renewed, new and improved products, machines, things or artefacts. A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed.","1836":"Microfluidic devices with integrated valves provide precise, programmable fluid handling platforms for high-throughput biological or chemical assays. However, setting up the infrastructure to control such platforms often requires specific engineering expertise or expensive commercial solutions. To address these obstacles, we present a Kit for Arduino-based Transistor Array Actuation (KATARA), an open-source and low-cost Arduino-based controller that can drive 70 solenoid valves to pneumatically actuate integrated microfluidic valves. We include a python package with a GUI to control the KATARA from a personal computer. No programming experience is required.","1837":"This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much as possible on open hardware.","1844":"Scientific communities are drawn to the open source model as an increasingly utilitarian method to produce and share work. Initially used as a means to develop freely-available software, open source projects have been applied to hardware including scientific tools. Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards.","1845":"In this paper, we present the construction of a reliable and inexpensive pH stat device, by using open-source \"OpenPhControl\" software, inexpensive hardware (a peristaltic and a syringe pump, Arduino, a step motor...), readily available laboratory devices: a pH meter, a computer, a webcam, and some 3D printed parts. We provide a methodology for the design, development and test results of each part of the device, as well as of the entire system. In addition to dosing reagents by means of a low-cost peristaltic pump, we also present carefully controlled dosing of reagents by an open-source syringe pump. The upgrading of the basic open-source syringe pump is given in terms of pump control and application of a larger syringe. In addition to the basic functions of pH stat, i.e. pH value measurement and maintenance, an improvement allowing the device to be used for potentiometric titration has been made as well. We have demonstrated the device's utility when applied for cellulose fibers oxidation with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical, i.e. for TEMPO-mediated oxidation. In support of this, we present the results obtained for the oxidation kinetics, the consumption of added reagent and experimental repeatability. Considering that the open-source scientific tools are available to everyone, and that researchers can construct and adjust the device according to their needs, as well as, that the total cost of the open-source pH stat device, excluding the existing laboratory equipment (pH meter, computer and glossary) was less than 150 EUR, we believe that, at a small fraction of the cost of available commercial offers, our open-source pH stat can significantly improve experimental work where the use of pH stat is necessary.","1848":"Polymerization-based amplification (PBA) uses a visible-light photopolymerization reaction for rapid, low-cost signal amplification and colorimetric detection in disease diagnostics. PBA is particularly useful for point-of-care testing (POCT) in the developing world where laboratory infrastructure and access to advanced technologies may be limited. To date, PBA has required expensive (similar to 5K USD), desktop-based light sources to drive these photopolymerization reactions, which has limited its use in limited-resource areas and for POCT applications. Here, we present a portable, lightweight, and low-cost device that can generate light of the intensity and wavelengths required to perform the PBA reactions rapidly (< 100 s) with minimal energy consumption. We developed analog and digital versions of the device that meet these criteria and can operate on their own without the requirement of a computer to run necessary software. Lastly, they both have the added functionality to dim the intensity of the LED to allow customization of the reaction conditions to the needs of individual assays.","1849":"This paper presents a robotic platform, PiBot, which was developed to improve the teaching of robotics with vision to secondary students. Its computational core is the Raspberry Pi 3 controller board, and the greatest novelty of this prototype is the support developed for the powerful camera mounted on board, the PiCamera. An open software infrastructure written in Python language was implemented so that the student may use this camera as the main sensor of the robotic platform. Furthermore, higher-level commands were provided to enhance the learning outcome for beginners. In addition, a PiBot 3D printable model and the counterpart for the Gazebo simulator were also developed and fully supported. They are publicly available so that students and schools without the physical robot or that cannot afford to obtain one, can nevertheless practice, learn and teach Robotics using these open platforms: DIY-PiBot and\/or simulated-PiBot.","1850":"This paper presents a system for remote monitoring of turbidity data that can detect light intensity and temperature using a microcontroller and the Internet of Things. The system comprises a light dependent resistor and infrared temperature sensor interfaced with an ESP-12E microcontroller, a programmable data acquisition platform; together these enable remote real-time monitoring of turbidity data applicable to chemical education. This system will allow educators and students to monitor chemical experiments in real-time through a web browser. Changes in turbidity and signal processing associated with a light dependent resistor are stored locally on the microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via a WiFi-based connection to a cloud-based server. The light intensity signals are displayed on the system through an organic light-emitting diode and subsequently uploaded to a cloud-based server. A web-based signal processing MATLAB program plots the uploaded signals available as real-time streams to authorized subscribers over standard browsers.","1853":"In this paper, we present a low-cost, stand-alone sensory platform developed for in situ monitoring of environmental parameters, for use in the Amazon region in the north of Brazil. The mission of the platform is to perform monitoring and identification of overirradiance (solar irradiance > 1000 W\/m(2)) and extreme overirradiance events (solar irradiance > 1300 W\/m(2)) using a photovoltaic based irradiance sensor. The sensory platform was built using the ESP8266 microcontroller, an open embedded computer capable of Wi-Fi communication using the IEEE 802.11 standard, and small photovoltaic modules, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, voltage, and current sensors, enabling the development of a low-cost system ((sic)70\/R$350.00 BRL). Calibration and tests were conducted at the Federal University of Para (UFPA), Belem campus, Para, where the platform measured an extreme overirradiance of 1321 W\/m(2) at a low-latitude (1 degrees S) and low altitude (7 m above sea level).","1854":"Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.","1863":"This paper discusses how emerging issues in housing construction could revolutionise the building industry. It focuses on commons-based networks of organisations, technologies and users that form a niche practice on the margins of the dominant paradigm. This practice can be understood as \"Design Global, Manufacture Local\" and is exemplified by the Hexayurt, the Open Source Ecology Microhouse and the WikiHouse. Using these descriptive case studies, light is shed on the challenges and opportunities of open construction systems with regard to technological, institutional and social perspectives. Notwithstanding the positive dynamics, certain issues need to be addressed, so that a sustainable built environment could flourish.","1864":"We propose a new application of inexpensive light-emitting diode (LED)-based Sun photometers, consisting of measuring the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with high resolution within metropolitan scales. Previously, these instruments have been used at continental scales by the GLOBE program, but this extension is already covered by more expensive and higher-precision instruments of the AERONET global network. For this we built an open source two-channeled LED-based Sun photometer based on previous developments, with improvements in the hardware, software, and modifications on the calibration procedure. Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564nm and 0.009 at the 408nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others.","1865":["In many urban areas the population is exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. However, real-time air quality is usually only measured at few locations. These measurements provide a general picture of the state of the air, but they are unable to monitor local differences. New low-cost sensor technology is available for several years now, and has the potential to extend official monitoring networks significantly even though the current generation of sensors suffer from various technical issues.","Citizen science experiments based on these sensors must be designed carefully to avoid generation of data which is of poor or even useless quality. This study explores the added value of the 2016 Urban AirQ campaign, which focused on measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Sixteen low-cost air quality sensor devices were built and distributed among volunteers living close to roads with high traffic volume for a 2-month measurement period.","Each electrochemical sensor was calibrated in-field next to an air monitoring station during an 8-day period, resulting in R-2 ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. When temperature and relative humidity are included in a multilinear regression approach, the NO2 accuracy is improved significantly, with R-2 ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. Recalibration after the campaign is crucial, as all sensors show a significant signal drift in the 2-month measurement period. The measurement series between the calibration periods can be corrected for after the measurement period by taking a weighted average of the calibration coefficients.","Validation against an independent air monitoring station shows good agreement. Using our approach, the standard deviation of a typical sensor device for NO2 measurements was found to be 7 mu gm(-3), provided that temperatures are below 30 degrees C. Stronger ozone titration on street sides causes an underestimation of NO2 concentrations, which 75% of the time is less than 2.3 mu gm(-3).","Our findings show that citizen science campaigns using low-cost sensors based on the current generations of electro-chemical NO2 sensors may provide useful complementary data on local air quality in an urban setting, provided that experiments are properly set up and the data are carefully analysed."],"1866":"The ability of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle to navigate and fly precisely determines its utility and performance. The current navigation systems are highly dependent on the global positioning system and are prone to error because of global positioning system signal outages. However, advancements in onboard processing have enabled inertial navigation algorithms to perform well during short global positioning system outages. In this article, we propose an intelligent optical flow-based algorithm combined with Kalman filters to provide the navigation capability during global positioning system outages and global positioning system-denied environments. Traditional optical flow measurement uses block matching for motion vector calculation that makes the measurement task computationally expensive and slow. We propose the application of an artificial bee colony-based block matching technique for faster optical flow measurements. To effectively fuse optical flow data with inertial sensors output, we employ a modified form of extended Kalman filter. The modifications make the filter less noisy by utilizing the redundancy of sensors. We have achieved an accuracy of similar to 95% for all non-global positioning system navigation during our simulation studies. Our real-world experiments are in agreement with the simulation studies when effects of wind are taken into consideration.","1867":["Research SummaryOpen innovation is about firms harnessing knowledge flows across firm boundaries, but limited research has examined the nature and antecedents of these flows for start-up firms, as well as the interdependence of inbound and outbound flows. From a new sample of start-up firms making 3D printers, we show how their degree of openness for inbound and outbound knowledge flows relates to the firms' initial capabilities and founding intentions. From this, we suggest that the patterns of openness are influenced more by initial factor endowments than a firm-specific process of emergent strategy development.","Managerial SummaryInnovative firms often face trade-offs between open and proprietary strategies, particularly in industries and segments where online communities and other collaborations provide a pool of shared knowledge for the entire industry. This study illuminates these trade-offs by comparing the choices made by the founders of 3D printer manufacturers. For products based on modular systems, it shows the range of choices that firms have on their degree of inbound openness (using external technology) and outbound openness (sharing their own technology)as well as the interdependencies of these choices. Finally, it points to long-term implications of early entrepreneurial decisions: firms that leverage external technology can enter markets more quickly, but their innovation options will be limited unless they have capabilities for proprietary innovation."],"1868":"Despite growing interest in collective robotics over the past few years, analysing and debugging the behaviour of swarm robotic systems remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate tools.

In this paper we describe the key features of the software, the hardware required to support it, its implementation, and usage examples. ARDebug is specifically designed with adoption by other institutions in mind, and aims to provide an extensible tool that other researchers can easily integrate with their own experimental infrastructure.","1869":"Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy.","1870":"Environmental sensing data provide crucial information for environment-related decision-making. Formal data are provided by official environmental institutes. Beyond those, however, there is a growing body of so-called informal sensing data, which are contributed by citizens using low-cost sensors. How good are these informal data, and how might they be applied, next to formal environmental sensing data? Could both types of sensing data be gainfully integrated? This paper presents the results of an online survey investigating perceptions within citizen science communities, environmental institutes and their networks of formal and informal environmental sensing data. The results show that citizens and experts had different views of formal and informal environmental sensing data, particularly on measurement frequency and the data information provision power. However, there was agreement, too, for example, on the accuracy of formal environmental sensing data. Furthermore, both agreed that the integration of formal and informal environmental sensing data offered potential for improvements on several aspects, particularly spatial coverage, data quantity and measurement frequency. Interestingly, the accuracy of informal environmental sensing data was largely unknown to both experts and citizens. This suggests the need for further investigation of informal environmental sensing data and the potential for its effective integration with formal environmental sensing data, if hurdles like standardisation can be overcome.

These diagnostics monitor the fabrication of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which detect and flag any non-uniformity that may potentially harm PEMFC performance and\/or lifetime. This will require quantitative thresholds and a clear distinction between harmful defects and harmless coating irregularities. Thus, novel fuel cell hardware with quasi in-situ infrared (IR) thermography capabilities is utilized to understand how bare spots in the cathode electrode impact MEA lifetime. An accelerated stress test (AST) simulates chemical and mechanical degradation modes seen in vehicular operation. The actual open circuit voltage and rate of change of this voltage are used as in-situ indicators for MEA failure, enabling capture of the progression of failure point development. Bare spot coating irregularities located at the center of the electrode were found to have no impact on MEA lifetime when compared to a pristine MEA. However, MEA lifetime was found to be considerably shortened when these same irregularities are located at the cathode inlet and, especially, the anode inlet regions of the fuel cell.

The PhenoBox\/PhenoPipe system is able to detect established salt stress responses in N.benthamiana.","We have developed an affordable, automated, open source imaging and data processing solution that can be adapted to various phenotyping applications in plant biology and beyond."],"1877":"Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.","1878":"Critical accounts suggest that the 'sharing economy' is mainly an ideological entity, bringing together a wide range of diverse empirical phenomena that have little in common, apart from their common adherence to an ideology of 'sharing'. This article suggests that the sharing economy can be empirically understood as instances of peer production attempting to 'come to market via the use of a common 'sharing fiction'. Analysing the origins and present functions of this fiction, the author suggests that we can conceptualize differentials in economic power within the sharing economy in terms of the work that goes into the reproduction of this sharing fiction and the ability to capitalize on it in terms of price differentials.","1879":"Systems dynamics and automatic control is classified as one of the toughest courses in the college of engineering at Qassim University according to the statistical analysis of the final grades. This motivated us to think about a new approach to teach this course by extending the design term project to include experimental part beside the theoretical analysis. This approach has become feasible due to the publicity of the low-cost microcontrollers such as the Arduino in the recent years. In this paper, we present our experience in conducting Arduino-based projects and how we used them to support the teaching of all the automatic control subjects in the course such as the mathematical modelling, the stability analysis, the controller design and the implementation of thePID controller. It was found that the new approach improves the attention and the overall performance of the students in the course which was reflected in the students' marks in the quizzes and exams. Moreover, it motivated the students to be creative by utilising the control theory to design new systems that can be useful for their local community.","1881":"The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus is on the \"design global, manufacture local\" model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a \"design global, manufacture local\" model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. \"Design global, manufacture local\" may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production.

In particular, since the average number of electronic devices in homes increases year by year and their sensitivity is very high, it is not only important to monitor the total energy consumption, but also the quality of the power supplied. However, in practice, end-users do not have information about the energy consumption in real-time nor about the quality of the power they receive, because electric energy meters are too expensive and complex to be handled. In order to overcome these inconveniences, an innovative, open source, low-cost, precise, and reliable power and electric energy meter is presented that can be easily installed and managed by any inexperienced user at their own home in urban or rural areas. The system was validated in a real house over a period of two weeks, showing interesting results and findings which validate our proposal.","1885":"The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of makers that actively share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and re-distributed. Numerous authors have proposed distinct ways to seize this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: enabling scholars to explore scientific concepts, promoting students' creativity, helping them to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, and so on. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the literature on open-source hardware in education by analyzing and classifying 676 publications. The results of our work provide: 1) guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant papers, publication sources, institutions, and countries); 2) information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing its main educational goals, stages, and topics where it is principally applied); and 3) directions for future research.","1890":"Low-cost video surveillance systems are attractive for Smart Home applications (especially in emerging economies). Those systems use the flexibility of the Internet of Things to operate the video camera only when an intrusion is detected. We are the only ones that focus on the design of protocols based on intelligent agents to communicate the video of an intrusion in real time to the guards by wireless or mobile networks. The goal is to communicate, in real time, the video to the guards who can be moving towards the smart home. However, this communication suffers from sporadic disruptions that difficults the control and drastically reduces user satisfaction and operativity of the system. In a novel way, we have designed a generic software architecture based on design patterns that can be adapted to any hardware in a simple way. The implanted hardware is of very low economic cost; the software frameworks are free. In the experimental tests we have shown that it is possible to communicate to the moving guard, intrusion notifications (by e-mail and by instant messaging), and the first video frames in less than 20 s. In addition, we automatically recovered the frames of video lost in the disruptions in a transparent way to the user, we supported vertical handover processes and we could save energy of the smartphone's battery. However, the most important thing was that the high satisfaction of the people who have used the system.","1891":"In this paper, due to the detected educational demands regarding automatic control and training in management of solar tracker systems, a small prototype based on low cost open source hardware and computer vision is built to test the control algorithms developed in Mathematica and Simulink.

Finally, its educational application is discussed.","1892":"3D printing content, which has been increasingly shared through the open communities over the last decade, has both aesthetic and functional features. There has been growing concern over whether current licensing policies provide sufficient options for contributors to the open communities. To suggest a direction for alternative license options, it is necessary to understand contributors' license preferences for sharing diverse 3D printing content. Using a logit model based on information collected from Thingiverse, this study investigates the relationship between the various features of 3D printing content and contributors' choices among the Creative Commons licenses currently available. The result indicates that preferences are clearly distinguished by the features of the content, whether the content is functional or non-functional in nature. However, there is no significant difference, in terms of license choice, for the numerous 3D printing content items that contain both functional and non-functional features. This result implies that there is a deficiency in the current licenses that cover 3D printing content. Implications for future license policies are discussed.","1899":"With the continued establishment of hacker-spaces and fab-labs hosted in academic libraries, there is an increase in the availability of resources for designing scientific instrumentation in the undergraduate curriculum. Many available designs, however, may be too complex to fabricate in teaching environments.

OMIS consists of a 3D printed syringe pump, control hardware based upon the Arduino microcontroller and 3D printed reaction vessels. The OMIS syringe pump utilizes a low-power stepper motor which simplifies the instrument construction and allows for power to be supplied from batteries or the USB port of a computer. The simple design of OMIS allows for the instrument to be fabricated in one day, including the time to 3D print components. The OMIS syringe pump is able to deliver fluids at rates between 60 and 300 mu L\/min, depending on syringe size, with a reproducibility of 3%.

In addition, affordable fused filament fabrication (FFF)-based 3-D printing has successfully produced high-quality and affordable scientific equipment, focusing on tools without strict chemical compatibility limitations. As the additives and colorants used in 3-D printing filaments are proprietary, their compatibility with common chemicals is unknown, which has prevented their widespread use in laboratory chemical processing. In this study, the compatibility of ten widely available FFF plastics with solvents, acids, bases and solutions used in the wet processing of semiconductor materials is explored. The results provide data on materials unavailable in the literature and the chemical properties of 3-D printable plastics that were, are in line with literature. Overall, many 3-D printable plastics are compatible with concentrated solutions. Polypropylene emerged as a promising 3-D printable material for semiconductor processing due to its tolerance of strongly oxidizing acids, such as nitric and sulfuric acids. In addition, 3-D printed custom tools were demonstrated for a range of wet processing applications. The results show that 3-D printed plastics are potential materials for bespoke chemically resistant labware at less than 10% of the cost of such purchased tools. However, further studies are required to ascertain if such materials are fully compatible with clean room processing.","1905":"Low-power wide area networks (LPWANs) are gaining momentum within Internet of Things circles, thanks to their inherent capabilities to simplify network topologies and increase coverage in low-rate and low-power communications. This study focuses on a specific LPWAN technology, namely Long Range Wireless Area Network (LoRaWAN), which is being widely investigated by the research community worldwide. LoRaWAN offers many noticeable features, including wide coverage areas, security by design, power consumption and bandwidth optimisation, and a high degree of flexibility and reconfigurability. Unfortunately, in spite of these valuable characteristics, LoRaWAN appliances are often closed source and proprietary.

Moreover, an experimental campaign has been carried out in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed platform.","1908":"Arts, Real-Time Video and Interactivity for Sustainability (ARTiVIS) is an ongoing collaborative research project investigating how real-time video, DIY surveillance technologies and sensor data can be used as a tool for environmental awareness, activism and artistic explorations. The project consists of a series of digital contexts for aesthetic contemplation of nature and civic engagement, aiming to foster awareness and empowerment of local populations through DIY surveillance. At the core of the ARTIVIS efforts are a series of interactive installations (namely B-Wind!, Hug@tree and Play with Fire), that make use of surveillance technologies and real-time video as raw material to promote environmental awareness through the emotion generated by real-time connections with nature. Throughout the project development, the surveillance concept has been shifting from the use of surveillance technology in a centralized platform, to the idea of veillance with distributed peer-to-peer networks that can be used for science and environmental monitoring.

To overcome these barriers, this study provides open source (OS) designs for a low-cost circuit milling machine. First, design modifications for mechanical and electrical subsystems of the OS Distributed 3-D (D3D) Robotics prototyping system are provided. Next, Copper Carve, an OS custom graphical user interface, is developed to enable circuit board milling by implementing backlash and substrate distortion compensation. The performance of the OS D3D circuit mill is then quantified and validated for: positional accuracy, cut quality, feature accuracy, and distortion compensation. Finally, the return on investment is calculated for inventors using it. The results show by properly compensating for motion inaccuracies with Copper Carve, the machine achieves a motion resolution of 10 microns, which is more than adequate for most circuit designs. The mill is at least five times less expensive than all commercial alternatives and the material costs of the D3D mill are repaid from fabricating 20-43 boards.

However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable ((sic)810).

In our study, we have taken four different pesticides viz., aldrin, tetradifon, glyphosate, and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture and have structural dissimilarities\/diversity. By using optical sensing techniques such as steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, we have analyzed the detailed exciton dynamics of QD in the presence of different pesticides. It has been found that the pesticide containing good leaving groups ( Cl) can interact with QD promptly and has high binding affinity (similar to 10(7) M-1). The different binding signatures of QD with different pesticides enable us to differentiate between the pesticides. Time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy provides significant variance (similar to 150-300 ns) for different pesticides. Furthermore, a large variation (10(5) Omega to 7 X 10(4) Omega) in the resistance of QD in the presence of different pesticides was revealed by electrochemical sensing technique. Moreover, during the interaction with pesticides, QD can also act as a photocatalyst to degrade pesticides. Present investigation explored the fact that the rate of degradation is positively affected by the binding affinity, i.e., the greater the binding, the greater is the degradation. What is more, both optical and electrochemical measurements of QD, in tandem, as described in our study could be utilized as the pattern recognition sensor for detection of several pesticides.","1914":"We report the design and implementation of an affordable bedside device, Neo is capable of acquiring vital data in real time by integrating with diverse devices connected to newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). NICUs are equipped with multiple vital sign monitoring devices that are connected to the premature newborn and acquire a few gigabytes of data every day. The continuous vital data from these devices are manually documented every hour. This introduces errors and loses a large amount of high-resolution data. The intermittent documentation of physiological data also makes it difficult for clinicians to visualize and detect the trends of diagnostic utility. Neo is built on an affordable Internet of Things platform that aggregates and sends the real-time data to a cloud-based big data platform called integrated NICU. Apart from minimizing documentation errors, the device enables data acquisition at sufficiently real-time rates as to indicate the current status of all the patients at the NICU. Neo automates immediate vital sign status and past trends as graphs or charts that the doctor and nurses can view from anywhere through the Internet. Physiological signal and clinical parameters from Neo is used to score different diseases like sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity. This score predicts the physiological health of the newborn and aid clinicians in decision-making ensuring timely intervention.","1915":"The study of animal behaviour, ethology, is becoming more quantitative.

In addition, the system can be fabricated using only open source software and hardware. The design revolves around the Digital Universal Energy Logger (DUEL) Node, which is responsible for reading and properly scaling the voltage and current of a particular load, and then serializing it via an on-board ATTiny85 chip. The configuration of the DUEL node allows for custom sensitivity ranges, and can handle up to 50 A and 300 V. Up to 127 DUEL nodes communicate via Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) on a bus, which can be monitored and logged through an Arduino UNO, or other compatible microcontroller. Using accessible equipment, the DUEL node can be calibrated to a desirable accuracy and error. The DUEL nodes are also completely customizable, making them fit for any input range, where all commercially-available products are fixed range.

Iron oxide nanoparticles were attached to bacterial cells and cells were aggregated by application of magnetic field. Artificial cellular crowding triggered quorum sensing and led to the formation of biofilm at the sub-threshold population. Aggregation process was monitored by studying temporal dynamics of capacitance and conductance profiles. Capacitive profile exhibited a plateau upon introduction of magnetic field which was retained even after field was removed. This hysteresis property signified biofilm initiation in response to artificial crowding.

SlugCam was designed such that it can be deployed and left unattended for extended periods without requiring regular maintenance, e.g., frequent battery replacement. The system is built with off-the-shelf components which not only keeps it modular and low cost, but also facilitates its prototyping, rapid duplication, and evolution. SlugCam's on-board processing capability allows computer vision software to run locally and autonomously. Energy efficiency in SlugCam is accomplished both in: (1) hardware by micro-managing low-power components; as well as in (2) software by having the system's operation duty cycles automatically adapt to the current state of the battery in order to balance the trade-off between application-level requirements and power awareness. For example, SlugCam's smart camera node changes its monitoring behavior based on how much battery charge remains. Additionally, using its computer vision software, the system only records and transmits information upon event detection which contributes both to the system's energy efficiency as well as its low network bandwidth requirements. SlugCam's networking functionality enables camera nodes to transfer video files, as well as collaborate on tasks such as visual processing, event detection, and object tracking. It allows node-to-node, as well as scoped- or full broadcast communication. For point-to-point communication, SlugCam uses on-demand power-aware multi-path routing to transfer video files efficiently. Another important contribution of SlugCam is to provide an open-source wireless camera network that can adapt to address the requirements of future outdoor video monitoring applications. SlugCam also includes a Web-based server where video data is stored as well as a Web-based user interface that allows end users to interact with the system, tag, query and retrieve video files, and manage SlugCam nodes remotely. In addition to a detailed description of SlugCam, this paper presents an extensive power characterization of the system's operation and showcases its deployment in a lab testbed and a real world scenario.","1921":"The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4e amendment aims to improve reliability and energy efficiency in industrial and other challenging Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments. This paper presents an accurate and up-to-date energy consumption model for devices using this IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode. The model identifies all network-related CPU and radio state changes, thus providing a precise representation of the device behavior and an accurate prediction of its energy consumption. Moreover, energy measurements were performed with a dual-band OpenMote device, running the OpenWSN firmware. This allows the model to be used for devices using 2.4 GHz, as well as 868 MHz. Using these measurements, several network simulations were conducted to observe the TSCH energy consumption effects in end-to-end communication for both frequency bands. Experimental verification of the model shows that it accurately models the consumption for all possible packet sizes and that the calculated consumption on average differs less than 3% from the measured consumption. This deviation includes measurement inaccuracies and the variations of the guard time. As such, the proposed model is very suitable for accurate energy consumption modeling of TSCH networks.","1922":"Microplate readers are foundational instruments in experimental biology and bioengineering that enable multiplexed spectrophotometric measurements.

Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents\/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250 degrees C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing.

Sensor timing using dedicated hardware is the de-facto method to achieve optimal sensor performance, but the solutions available today have limited flexibility and requires much effort when changing sensors. This article presents requirements and suggestions for a highly accurate, reconfigurable sensor timing system that simplifies integration of sensor systems and navigation systems for UAVs. Both typical avionics sensors, like GNSS receivers and IMUs, and more complex sensors, such as cameras, are supported. To verify the design, an implementation named the SenTiBoard was created, along with a software support package and a baseline sensor-suite. With the solution presented in this paper we get a measurement resolution of 10 nanoseconds and we can transfer up to 7.6 megabytes per second. If the sensor suite includes a GNSS receiver with a pulse-per-second (PPS) reference, the sensor measurements can be related to an absolute time reference (UTC) with a clock drift of 1.9 microseconds per second RMS. An experiment was carried out, using a Mini Cruiser fixed-wing UAV, where errors in georeferencing infrared images were reduced with a factor of 4 when compared to a software synchronization method.","1926":"Positively advocating that low-cost additive 3D-printing technologies and open-source licensed software\/hardware platforms represent an optimal solution to realize low-cost equipment, a mechanical and 3D-printable device for bilateral upper-limb rehabilitation is presented.

In this article, the sum of a wavefield recorded at two locations in a single channel is used to estimate the Green's function via the autocorrelation; the result contains some predicted artefacts. The underlying theory and hardware required to estimate the Green's function is presented and compared to traditional seismic interferometry. This technique is used to estimate the elastic Green's function between two locations on an aluminum block with surface scatterers. Wavefields excited via rapid thermoelastic expansion of the surface using a pulsed laser are detected by a dual-beam heterodyne interferometer. The detector is capable of directly recording the sum of a wavefield measured at two locations in a single channel. This method could be an effective, low cost, and non-contacting technique for structural monitoring, particularly where ambient noise has established equipartitioned wavefields in the structure.

We present a prototype, built with low-cost wearable sensors, that was used to capture data from 25 subjects while seated (at resting state), walking, and seated (after a gentle stroll). We used this data to evaluate how the different combinations of signals affected the biometric verification process. Our results showed that the low-cost sensors currently being embedded in many fitness bands and smart-watches can be combined to enable biometric verification. We report and compare the results obtained by all tested configurations. Our best configuration, which uses ECG, PPG and GSR, obtained 0.99 area under the curve and 0.02 equal error rate with only 60 s of training data. We have made our dataset public so that our work can be compared with proposals developed by other researchers.","1934":"Microfluidic technologies have been used across diverse disciplines (e.g. high-throughput biological measurement, fluid physics, laboratory fluid manipulation) but widespread adoption has been limited in part due to the lack of openly disseminated resources that enable non-specialist labs to make and operate their own devices. Here, we report the open-source build of a pneumatic setup capable of operating both single and multilayer (Quake-style) microfluidic devices with programmable scripting automation. This setup can operate both simple and complex devices with 48 device valve control inputs and 18 sample inputs, with modular design for easy expansion, at a fraction of the cost of similar commercial solutions. We present a detailed step-by-step guide to building the pneumatic instrumentation, as well as instructions for custom device operation using our software, Geppetto, through an easy-to-use GUI for live on-chip valve actuation and a scripting system for experiment automation. We show robust valve actuation with near real-time software feedback and demonstrate use of the setup for high-throughput biochemical measurements on-chip. This open-source setup will enable specialists and novices alike to run microfluidic devices easily in their own laboratories.","1935":"With the recent advancement in wearable computing, sensor technologies, and data processing approaches, it is possible to develop smart clothing that integrates sensors into garments. The main objective of this study was to develop the method of automatic recognition of sedentary behavior related to cardiovascular risk based on quantitative measurement of physical activity. The solution is based on the designed prototype of the smart shirt equipped with a processor, wearable sensors, power supply and telemedical interface. The data derived from wearable sensors were used to create feature vector that consisted of the estimation of the user-specific relative intensity and the variance of filtered accelerometer data. The method was validated using an experimental protocol which was designed to be safe for the elderly and was based on clinically validated short physical performance battery (SPPB) test tasks. To obtain the recognition model six classifiers were examined and compared including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Binary Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks. The classification models were able to identify the sedentary behavior with an accuracy of 95.00% +\/- 2.11%. Experimental results suggested that high accuracy can be obtained by estimating sedentary behavior pattern using the smart shirt and machine learning approach. The main advantage of the developed method to continuously monitor patient activities in a free-living environment and could potentially be used for early detection of increased cardiovascular risk.","1936":"We describe the development of a BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line-Of-Sight) model aircraft (UAV). The broad design requirements included (i) fuselage capable of accommodating an imaging package or other instrumentation, (ii) suitability for over-lake BVLOS authorization in Switzerland, (iii) capability of land or water take-offs\/landing, (iv) at least 90-min flight autonomy, (v) modularity of the imaging package and (vi) real-time IR\/RGB imagery. Requirement (i) was to ensure an aircraft amenable to future developments. Requirements (ii)-(iv) were driven by the goal of improving estimates of lake surface energy fluxes, since such fluxes have a major impact on long-term lake temperatures and hence ecological status. Requirement (v), in conjunction with (i), allows the UAV to be adapted to other imaging applications. The real-time imagery requirement (vi) permits modifications of on-going missions to map areas of specific interest as they are detected. The prototype UAV produced to satisfy these characteristics was built on the twin-motor My Twin Dream (MTD) aircraft, which has a 1.8-m wing span airframe and a spacious fuselage. The legal authorization necessitated, where feasible, hardware redundancy as well as installation of a parachute system. Continuous communication between the ground station and UAV is provided by the LTE cellular telephone network. The UAV communication is handled by an on-board Linux computer, which is also responsible for control of the imagery package. The avionics involved modifications of the open-source APM autopilot software and the associated ground control station. A key modification was to support a custom-built emergency recovery system, which is triggered by loss of a heart-beat signal from the autopilot. The MTD airframe was modified to accommodate the system electronics and imaging hardware. Results from test flights over Lake Geneva demonstrate the ability of the aircraft to produce imagery data.","1938":"India's Public Distribution System (PDS) comprises ration shops which are responsible for distribution of ration to many poor families. Necessary commodities such as rice, kerosene, sugar, wheat etc., are supplied to the less privileged sections as per the eligibility and at fixed rates by the Indian government. However, the existing system suffers from major drawbacks such as storage of food grains, manual and inconsistent tallying of records against stock, black marketing and housekeeping. Hence, the conventional system needs some modification to ensure there is minimal wastage and food grains reach the right people. The major contribution of the hardware lies in acquiring records from the warehouses located in far off places to a centralized server managed by the administrator. This system also solves the problem of black marketing with the use of Aadhar cards and biometric scanning which are used for the verification of the consumer at the time of purchase. In addition to the above, another aspect of the system is the management of two types of databases, one of them is used for storing the data of the consumer and the other for maintaining the record of the availability of the ration in various warehouses which are located in different parts of the country.

In addition to this, a comparative study is carried out of professional vibration acquisition technologies and low-cost systems, obtaining optimum results for low-and medium-frequency operations with an error of 2.19% on road tests.

The proposed ArUco mapping algorithm can build and correct the map of markers online with Grubbs criterion and K-mean clustering, which avoids the map distortion due to lack of correction. Based on the conception of multi-sensor information fusion, the federated Kalman filter is utilized to synthesize the multi-source information from markers, optical flow, ultrasonic and the inertial sensor, which can obtain a continuous localization result and effectively reduce the position drift due to the long-term loss of markers in pure marker localization. The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented in a hardware of one Raspberry Pi Zero and two STM32 micro controllers produced by STMicroelectronics (Geneva, Switzerland). Thus, a small-size and low-cost marker-based localization system is presented. The experimental results show that the speed estimation result of the proposed system is better than Px4flow, and it has the centimeter accuracy of mapping and positioning. The presented system not only gives satisfying localization precision, but also has the potential to expand other sensors (such as visual odometry, ultra wideband (UWB) beacon and lidar) to further improve the localization performance. The proposed system can be reliably employed in Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) visual localization and robotics control.","1945":"A novel moisture sensor based on near field communication (NFC) is presented.

These data are stored into the EEPROM memory of the NFC-integrated circuit in NFC data exchange format, which is read by the reader. An analysis of different methods to measure the soil moisture is presented in order to select the approach, which fits better with the constraints of an NFC energy harvested system.","1948":"Rapid manufacturing using 3-D printing is a potential solution to some of the most pressing issues for humanitarian logistics. In this paper, findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6) on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control mechanisms. The technology is then disclosed with an open source license for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer. A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a humanitarian context.","1951":"In this paper, a structured methodology is proposed to define the architecture for a communication framework with multiframe capability, which can be embedded in a residential smart meter hardware for smart grid applications. This framework is based on the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet protocol, and it is considered that the data are exchanged via wireless technologies. The architectural model was based upon the state-of-the-art in software engineering, making use of the design patterns and the principles of low coupling and high cohesion, which result in a solution that is both more reliable and maintainable. A security module is also provided and the framework performance is evaluated, in terms of packet throughput and computational effort of the security layer on the processing device, via practical experiments of some laboratory scenarios. Furthermore, errors on some frames are introduced in order to evaluate the feasibility of this framework in real field applications. Results show that this framework architecture supports acceptable transfer rates even with extra computational cost due to the use of data encryption and separated processing modules, making it a feasible proposal for the considered application context.","1952":"Although air pollution is one of the most significant environmental factors posing a threat to human health worldwide, air quality data are scarce or not easily accessible in most European countries. The current work aims to develop a centralized air quality data hub that enables citizens to contribute to air quality monitoring. In this work, data from official air quality monitoring stations are combined with air pollution estimates from sky-depicting photos and from low-cost sensing devices that citizens build on their own so that citizens receive improved information about the quality of the air they breathe. Additionally, a data fusion algorithm merges air quality information from various sources to provide information in areas where no air quality measurements exist.","1955":"Nowadays, one of the biggest issues addressed to electronic sensor fabrication is the build-up of efficient electrodes as an alternative way to the expensive, complex and multistage processes required by traditional techniques. Printed electronics arises as an interesting alternative to fulfill this task due to the simplicity and speed to stamp electrodes on various surfaces. Within this context, the Fused Deposition Modeling 3D printing is an emerging, cost-effective and alternative technology to fabricate complex structures that potentiates several fields with more creative ideas and new materials for a rapid prototyping of devices. We show here the fabrication of interdigitated electrodes using a standard home-made CoreXY 3D printer using transparent and graphene-based PLA filaments. Macro 3D printed electrodes were easily assembled within 6 min with outstanding reproducibility. The electrodes were also functionalized with different nanostructured thin films via dip-coating Layer-by-Layer technique to develop a 3D printed e-tongue setup. As a proof of concept, the printed e-tongue was applied to soil analysis. A control soil sample was enriched with several macro-nutrients to the plants (N, P, K, S, Mg, and Ca) and the discrimination was done by electrical impedance spectroscopy of water solution of the soil samples. The data was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and the 3D printed sensor distinguished clearly all enriched samples despite the complexity of the soil chemical composition. The 3D printed e-tongue successfully used in soil analysis encourages further investments in developing new sensory tools for precision agriculture and other fields exploiting the simplicity and flexibility offered by the 3D printing techniques.","1956":"This contribution summarizes the multiple uses of 3D web technologies in commercial archaeology. Considering the breadth of this topic, we will describe each different branch of these technologies with the example of case studies based on work of the Italian company Arc-Team. Our overview begins with 3D visualization for scientific purposes, showing a project funded by the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol (Italy) in order to improve knowledge about WWI. Second, we analyze a similar project, funded by the Autonomous Province of Trentino (Italy), but with the aim to increase tourism at a high alpine WWI site. The third example is the development of another prototype for tourism: a 3D web-map for the cultural valorization of the historical border (1753) between the region Tyrol and the Most Serene Republic of Venice. In the forth case study, we discuss the implementation of 3D within web platforms for archaeological project management of RAPTOR (Ricerca Archivi e Pratiche per la Tutela Operativa Regionale), a webGIS developed to aid in preservation and conservation efforts of cultural heritage for the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (MiBACT). Fifth, we explore recent uses of 3D models for web-coworking during the process of excavation management, thanks to the developments of real-time 3D acquisition techniques based on SLAM algorithms and archeorobotic devices. Finally, 3D web-coworking is also analyzed illustrating some simple web tools that afford rapid feedback in data visualization, considering not only excavation field-work but also exploration projects. This overview, based on six different case studies, represents the four fields in which 3D web technologies are currently used in commercial archaeology: scientific communication; tourism improvement; preservation of cultural heritage; and real time field-work management. Some specific topics such as tourism improvement and field-work management are investigated in greater depth in order to allow us to analyze variables deriving from customer requests (e.g. restrictions regarding sensitive geolocation or preferences for specific web platforms) and from differences among data acquisition technologies based on various sensors.","1957":"Containing a wildfire requires an efficient response and persistent monitoring. A crucial aspect is the ability to search for the boundaries of the wildfire by exploring a wide area. However, even as wildfires are increasing today, the number of available monitoring systems that can provide support is decreasing, creating an operational gap and slow response in such urgent situations. The objective of this work is to estimate a propagating boundary and create an autonomous system that works in real time. It proposes a coordination strategy with a new methodology for estimating the periphery of a propagating phenomenon using limited observations. The complete system design, tested on the high-fidelity simulation, demonstrates that steering the vehicles toward the highest perpendicular uncertainty generates the effective predictions. The results indicate that the new coordination scheme has a large beneficial impact on uncertainty suppression. This study thus suggests that an efficient solution for suppressing uncertainty in monitoring a wildfire is to use a fleet of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles that can be deployed quickly. Further research is needed on other deployment schemes that work in different natural disaster case studies.","1961":"Along with the technical feasibility of microgrids, the importance of supervisory communications, computing, and control (CCC) systems that are necessary to operate a microgrid in a stable and economically feasible manner have been firmly established in the literature. While several investigators have proposed and demonstrated algorithms and applications of CCC, the functional entities and responsibility centers for realizing CCC within microgrids in the context of multiple independent customers and distribution system entities have not been situated and\/or studied. In this context, the term emergent microgrid may be used to define an electrical network that consists of local generation, loads, and storage. Such a grid has the potential to be clustered as a microgrid, but does not have all the CCC features to become a full-fledged microgrid. In this paper, a simple electric utility platform (SEUP) that is an end-to-end solution with all the hardware\/software interfaces and components necessary for augmenting emergent microgrids with CCC into full-fledged microgrids is presented. SEUP abstracts the details of sensing and CCC for the microgrid developers, installers, operators and end-users to provide a seamless system. SEUP is distinctive from other CCC platforms in that it is entirely based on publicly available infrastructure resources (wireless cellular networks, internet and cloud computing) without any intellectual property restrictions. The paper introduces the functional roles, main architecture, components and security features of SEUP along with the results from a sample application case of a laboratory-scale power system.","1962":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important agenda in the advanced manufacturing environment. In order to encourage IoT application and assure an appropriate selection of processes to be improved by IoT technology, a group of analysis criteria must be highlighted to give the companies a tool to perform the correct selection. This study aims to propose a model for selecting IoT technology. The research design combines a systematic literature review, applying bibliometrics and content analysis, with case application and refinement. An application was carried out in an IoT hardware company, incorporating it at a solvent recycling machine. A second application was performed in a seedling selection machine producer. As a result, a model for selecting IoT technology is presented, which consists of four phasesprocess modeling, grading, weighting, and final selection. The model applies an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on the following criteria: reliability, security, business, mobility, and heterogeneity. The results also suggest IoT selection is related to the ability of combining different criteria related to the system and technology selection to install IoT solutions. Finally, issues related to the system characteristics other than technology are becoming more cited in the literature in the last 5years concluding that selecting IoT technology is a complex activity that needs to be improved, especially in the years to come.","1963":"Objective. A major goal in systems neuroscience is to determine the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior. 'lb this end, methods that combine monitoring neural activity, behavioral tracking, and targeted manipulation of neurons in closed-loop are powerful tools. However, commercial systems that allow these types of experiments are usually expensive and rely on non-standardized data formats and proprietary software which may hinder user-modifications for specific needs. In order to promote reproducibility and data-sharing in science, transparent software and standardized data formats are an advantage. Here, we present an open source, low-cost, adaptable, and easy to set-up system for combined behavioral tracking, electrophysiology, and closed-loop stimulation. Approach. Based on the Open Ephys system (www.open-ephys.org ) we developed multiple modules to include realtime tracking and behavior-based closed-loop stimulation. We describe the equipment and provide a step-by-step guide to set up the system. Combining the open source software Bonsai (bonsai-rx.org ) for analyzing camera images in real time with the newly developed modules in Open Ephys, we acquire position information, visualize tracking, and perform tracking-based closed-loop stimulation experiments. To analyze the acquired data we provide an open source file reading package in Python. Main results. The system robustly visualizes real-time tracking and reliably recovers tracking information recorded from a range of sampling frequencies (30-1000 Hz). We combined electrophysiology with the newly-developed tracking modules in Open Ephys to record place cell and grid cell activity in the hippocampus and in the medial entorhinal cortex, respectively. Moreover, we present a case in which we used the system for closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal grid cells. Significance. Expanding the Open Ephys system to include animal tracking and behavior-based closed-loop stimulation extends the availability of high-quality, low-cost experimental setup within standardized data formats serving the neuroscience community.","1966":"Water quality assessment programs for the management of water resources require the collection of water samples for physical, chemical, and biological analyses. Lack of personnel, accessibility of water bodies, and time constraints, especially after natural disasters and emergencies, are some of the challenges of water sampling. To overcome these challenges, a custom-made thief-style water sampling mechanism was developed and mounted on a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for autonomous water sampling. The payload capacity and endurance of the UAV were determined using an indoor test station. The UAV was equipped with floatation, and electronic components were coated to prevent water damage in the event of a forced landing or for sample collection. Water samples from a 1.1 ha pond were collected with the developed UAV-assisted water sampling system and traditional manual methods. Dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature and chloride measurements were made on samples collected with both UAV-assisted and manual methods and compared. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature were minimal except for chloride level. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature measurements were 3.6%, 2.3%, 0.76%, and 0.03%, respectively. Measured chloride levels for the manual and UAV-assisted sampling methods were 3.97 and 5.46 mg\/L. UAV-assisted water sampling may prove faster and safer than manual water sampling from large surface waters and from difficult to access water bodies.","1968":"This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an \"operational pragmatics.\" Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how \"operational pragmatics\" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.","1969":"Without requiring targets to carry any device, device-free-based tracking is playing an important role in many emerging applications such as smart homes, fitness tracking, intruder detection, etc. While promising, current device-free tracking systems based on inexpensive commercial devices perform well in the training environment, but poorly in other environments because of different multipath reflections. This paper introduces RDTrack, a system that leverages changes in Doppler shifts, which are not sensitive to multipath, to accurately track the target. Moreover, RDTrack identifies particular patterns for fine-grained motions such as turning, walking straightly, etc., which can achieve accurate tracking. For the purpose of achieving a fine-grained device-free tracking system, this paper builds a trajectory estimating model using HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to improve the matching accuracy and reduce the time complexity. We address several challenges including estimating the tag influenced time period, identifying moving path and reducing false positives due to multipath. We implement RDTrack with inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) hardware and extensively evaluate RDTrack in a lobby, staircase and library. Our results show that RDTrack is effective in tracking the moving target, with a low tracking error of 32 cm. This accuracy is robust for different environments, highlighting RDTrack's ability to enable future essential device-free moving-based interaction with RFID devices.","1972":"The rise of a maker movement, located in hacker and makerspaces and involving the democratization of technologies of production and support of grassroots innovation, is receiving increasing attention from science and technology studies (STS) scholarship. This article explores how hacking is characterized by users of hacker and makerspaces and relates this to broader discussion of the maker movement as, for instance, promoting innovation, engaged in countercultural critique, or as accessible to anyone. Based on an interview study of users of twelve hacker and makerspaces across the United States, it argues that for these users, hacking is not about politics, commercial innovation, or critique. Rather, it is understood as a lifestyle one subscribes to, a meaningful leisure activity, or as providing access to a welcoming and close-knit community. Contrary to expectations of the maker movement as heralding social change, the benefits of hacking were viewed as personal rather than political, economic, or social; similarly, democratization of technology was experienced as rather incidental to most hackers' and makers' experiences.","1973":"This paper presents academic efforts aimed at integrating methodologies associated with the use of mobile devices, the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of experimental education in civil engineering. This integration is developed by encompassing the use of sensors, microcontrollers, civil engineering problems, app development, and fabrication. The proposal provides an explorative way of approaching the numerous possibilities that arise in civil engineering when it comes to IoT, automation, monitoring, and control of civil engineering processes. The used tools represent accessible and affordable ways for application in classrooms and in educational laboratories for beginners. The initial explorative approach implies the fusion of three realms: (i) the phenomenology and mathematics of varied civil engineering problems; (ii) the systematic use of digital fabrication technologies and electronic prototyping platforms; and (iii) the creative and visual way of developing codes provided by block-based development platforms. This integration of perspectives is an attempt of approaching civil engineering mathematics to technology and arts with a rigorous scientific approach. A set of different examples is presented with the corresponding findings in educational terms. These examples are developed in a constructive, scaffolding-based way and may contribute as a potential alternative in the development of open-source teaching labs in civil engineering schools.","1978":"The low-cost Open qPCR instrument can be used for different tasks in the aptamer selection process: quantification of DNA, cycle course optimization, screening, and final binding characterization. We have selected aptamers against whole Drosophila C virus (DCV) particles and recombinant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We performed systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) using the Open qPCR to optimize each amplification step. The Open qPCR instrument identified the best aptamer candidate. The Open qPCR has the capacity to perform melt curves, and we used this function to perform thermofluorimetric analysis (TFA) to quantify target-aptamer binding. We confirmed target-aptamer binding using flow cytometry. A sandwich type luminescence bioassay based on our anti-DCV aptamer was sensitive to DCV and did not respond to a related virus, demonstrating that our selected anti-DCV aptamer can be used to specifically detect DCV.","1983":"Acoustic manipulation by an ultrasonic phased array provides an entirely new approach to processes such as coalescence, mixing, separation, and evaporation occurring in the generation of new materials, physical property measurement, the biomedical industry, etc. However, to date, ultrasonic phased arrays have not been fully investigated for applications in fluid manipulation. This paper provides contactless coalescence and mixing techniques for droplets in air by controlling the acoustic potential by using an ultrasonic phased array. We focused on mode oscillation to propose an efficient mixing technique for liquid without contact. A comparison of mixing performance between cases with mode oscillation and without mode oscillation showed that the flow induced by mode oscillation promotes droplet mixing. Our paper demonstrates the feasibility of contactless coalescence and mixing as a first step in fluid manipulation with a phased array.","1984":"About a decade ago, people concerned about the risks of adopting cloud computing. It was an unproven new thing that raised more questions than it answered. Nowadays, we hear more about the risks of not adopting the cloud. Three of the leading cloud players, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, and other participants have developed complex cloud platforms that are driving the cloud agenda and launching innovative new products to meet the needs of modern businesses. When looking at processors, core components of the cloud, there is a trend for hyperscale data centers is to move beyond the CPUs and turn to dedicated chips, such as graphics processing units, field programmable gating arrays, and application specific integrated circuits. We think it is an artificial intelligence (AI) realization process and provide a detailed survey about hardware server design in this process. After discussing and summarizing various disclosed techniques and platforms, we conceived a hybrid hardware structure for efficient AI applications.","1985":"This paper develops a novel energy universal service bus system (EUSBS) based on emerging energy Internet (E-net) technologies. This EUSBS is a unified identification and plug-and-play interface platform to which high penetration distributed energy and equipment (DEE), including photovoltaic (PV), fans, electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), energy storage equipment (ESE), and commercial and residential users (CRUs), can access in a coordinated control and optimized utilization mode. First, the functions design, overall framework and topology architecture design of the EUSBS are expounded, among which the EUSBS is mainly composed of a hardware system and a software platform. Moreover, several future application scenarios are presented. Then, the hardware part of EUSBS is designed and developed, including the framework design of this hardware subsystem, and development of the hardware equipment for PV access, fans access, EVCS access, ESE access, and CRU access. The hardware subsystem consists of smart socket, and household\/floor\/building concentrators. Based on this, the prototypes development of EUSBS hardware equipment is completely demonstrated. Third, the software part of the EUSBS is developed as a cloud service platform for electricity use data analysis of DEE. This software subsystem contains the power quality & energy efficiency analysis module, optimization control module, information and service module, and data monitoring and electricity behavior analysis module. Based on this design, the software interfaces are developed. Finally, an application study on energy management and optimization of a smart commercial building is conducted to evaluate the functions and practicality of this EUSBS. The EUSBS developed in this paper is able to overcome difficulties in big data collection and utilization on sides of distribution network and electricity utilization, and eventually implement a deep information-energy fusion and a friendly supply-demand interaction between the grid and users. This contribution presents a detailed and systematic development scheme of the EUSBS, and moreover, the laboratory prototypes of the hardware and software subsystems have been developed based on E-net technologies.

In most discussions on degrowth, economic activity has been reduced to relatively marginal activities. We see a need to connect degrowth to more typical business activities, because business is an essential part of the modern world. We put forward seven criteria which can be used to assess whether a company follows the degrowth paradigm: (1) Alternative understanding of business; (2) From business activity to activism and social movement; (3) Collaborative value creation; (4) Democratic governance; (5) Corporate leaders' commitment to company values in personal life; (6) Reduction of environmental impacts at all stages of product\/service life-cycle; (7) Making products that last and are repairable. We use these criteria to assess the performance of a case study company, Patagonia, which is known for its environmental and social record. Our assessment is not meant to be comprehensive, but to illustrate the relevance of the seven criteria. Our criteria offer guidance for aligning business activity with the broader degrowth objectives, and our analysis complements the recommendations made so far for degrowth in national and local policies.

These networks must be able to support mobile wireless CPSs that are demanding new requirements related to flexibility and heterogeneity without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS). However, it is hard to determine, for example, the optimal resource allocation or the most reliable paths without global network information. In this way, the Software-Defined Networking paradigm is being considered as key to overcome such emerging needs. In particular, an SDN controller is able to establish paths between sensors and actuators according to bandwidth, latency, redundancy, and safety considerations. Thus, the goal of this paper is to review the state of the art of SDN approaches applied to mission-critical applications by identifying trends, challenges and opportunities for the potential development of software-defined cyber-physical networks.

It situates kite-mapping as a low cost, high quality, participatory approach, in relation to field use of maps, arguing that research might usefully attend to more than simply the skills acquired during the field exercise and the technicalities of the innovation. Evidenced from two day-long workshops on the Maltese island of Gozo we describe practical issues involved in making the mapping work. We draw on descriptions of field practice and deploy a multi-method evaluation of staff and student reactions and experiences to explore pedagogic aspects of kite-mapping. We conclude that the practices of kite-mapping significantly impact upon the value of the mapping technique, and highlight how creative and playful mapping processes implicit in the technique might usefully be deployed in other field contexts.","1994":"Recent developments in the field of low-cost sensors enable the design and implementation of compact, inexpensive and portable sensing units for air pollution monitoring with fine-detailed spatial and temporal resolution, in order to support applications of wider interest in the area of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this context, the present work advances the concept of developing a low-cost portable air pollution monitoring system (APMS) for measuring the concentrations of particulate matter (PM), in particular fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5). Specifically, this paper presents the on-field testing of the proposed low-cost APMS implementation using roadside measurements from a mobile laboratory equipped with a calibrated instrument as the basis of comparison and showcases its accuracy on characterizing the PM2.5 concentrations on 1 min resolution in an on-road trial. Moreover, it demonstrates the intended application of collecting fine-grained spatio-temporal PM2.5 profiles by mounting the developed APMS on an electric bike as a case study in the city of Mons, Belgium.","1997":"Accounts of the copyright industries in national reports suggest that strong intellectual property (IP) rights support creative firms. However, mounting evidence from sectors such as video game production and 3-D printing indicate that business models based on open IP can also be profitable. This study investigates the relationship between IP protection and value capture for creative industry firms engaged in collective\/open innovation activities. A sample of 22 businesses interviewed in this study did not require exclusive ownership of creative materials but instead employed a range of strategies to compete and capture value. Benefits for some firms resemble those for participants in private-collective innovation (PCI), originally observed in open-source software development. Advantages of PCI include the ability to commercialize user improvements and a reduction in transaction costs related to seeking and obtaining permission to innovate existing ideas. Some creative firms in this study were able to generate and capture value from PCI in two directions: upstream and downstream. These dynamics offer a mechanism to understand and articulate the value of openness for creative industries policy and management of creative organizations.

Within these environments, a mam challenge is to classify and forecast the behaviours of visitors by collecting their movements, choices and needs. In this paper, starting from the design of an IoT system for collecting behavioural data, we propose and discuss a model able to reproduce, and then \"predict\", the dynamics related to the interactions of the visitors with the exposed artworks and, in particular, with the available technologies. Generally, collected data are affected by many kinds of errors; to address this issue a powerful statistical method to reproduce the dynamics related to the visiting styles of the spectators is proposed. Numencal experiments on real data have been reported in order to assess the proposed methodology.","2000":"In this paper we demonstrate a potentiostat built with a single commercially available integrated circuit (IC) that does not require any external electronic components to perform electrochemical experiments. This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC (R)) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components. To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.","2003":"The present paper aims to evaluate the past and future environmental performance of the electricity generation in Brazil in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP). To that end, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool was used to evaluate the system's environmental performance, based on ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, using the Ecoinvent v 3.3 database. This study provides data on global warming by the GWP and GTP 100 years impact category. The functional unit and reference flow is kWh. The model was applied to the electricity generation in Brazil for the years 2016-2026 using Umberto NXT Universal software. The results indicate that the greatest environmental impacts lie on generation sources such as oil, natural gas, hydropower and hard coal. Carbon dioxide was the main contributor to atmospheric emissions in the life cycle of the Brazilian electricity matrix in 2016 and 2026. The total potential impact (and per kWh) is expected to decrease until 2021. The Brazilian electricity matrix is expected to be less pollutant in terms of carbon footprint until 2021. The study can contribute to directing public policies, promoting development actions and encouraging different electricity matrices.","2004":"Low-cost MEMS accelerometers have the potential to be used in a number of tilt-based monitoring applications but have the disadvantage of being very sensitive to temperature variation (thermal drift). In this paper, we analyze the thermal behavior of a low-cost sensor in the range -10 to +45 degrees C in order to provide a simple compensation strategy to mitigate this problem. For sensor analysis, we have developed a miniaturized thermal chamber, which was mounted on a tilting device to account for tilt angle variation. The obtained raw data were used to construct low degree polynomial equations that by relating the measurement error induced by thermal drift (i.e., acceleration residuals) to temperature and inclination (of each specific axis), can be used for thermal compensation. To validate our compensation strategy, we performed a field monitoring test and evaluated the compensation performance by calculating RMS errors before and after correction. After compensation, the RMS errors calculated for both the X and Y axes decreased by 96%, indicating the potential of using a simple set of equations to solve common drawbacks that currently make low-cost MEMS sensors unsuitable for tilt-based monitoring applications.","2008":"In this paper, we demonstrate an improvement in the accuracy of a low-cost smart temperature sensor, by measurement of the nonlinear curvature correction at multiple temperature references. The sensors were positioned inside a climate chamber and connected outside to a micro-controller via a network cable. The chamber temperature was increased systematically over a wide range from 20 degrees C to 55 degrees C. A set of calibration curves was produced from the best fitting second-order polynomial curves for the offset in temperature between the sensor and reference. An improvement in accuracy of +\/- 0.15 degrees C is with respect to the mentioned temperature range, compared to the significantly higher value reported of +\/- 0.5 degrees C by the manufacturer for similar conditions. In summary, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the calibration of a low-cost, smart sensor frequently used in research and academic projects over a useful range of temperatures.","2010":"This work presents a proof of concept for an end-to-end process for the agile design, control and programming of robots. The user selects a set of abilities for the desired robot, and the system automatically generates the robot structure and the controllers needed for the high level programming of the robot. This process relies on two pivotal concepts for our approach: ontologies and modular robots. An ontology (ADROn), constructed upon the IEEE Standard Ontologies for Robotics and Automation (ORA), is used by an intelligent system to relate the robot types with the requested set of abilities. Then, a parameterized design process generates the passive components (e.g. links) and selects the active modules (e.g. actuators) from a collection of 3D printable, modular robotic components (ParMoR). Finally, the controllers, generated as ROS services, are interfaced with a visual programming language, Bitbloq, suitable for novice users. Examples of the generation process of different types of robots (wheeled, snake, humanoid, hexapods) are detailed. The process is presented as an educational platform for the teaching of robotics, while the applicability to other fields and the advantages of this methodology are also discussed in the paper.","2011":"Even novice engineers and non-technical students can design and build an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype in four days. We present a setup for rapid IoT prototyping in a classroom, identify necessary skills and combine these to a workshop that allows students to turn their ideas into prototypes. Our approach enables fast prototyping cycle, using a common and welle-stablished development board and a computer. Arduino Uno is used for device prototyping and a Python program running on the same computer handles the needed Internet communications. A web server handles device and web client connectivity, logging and data monitoring. The method makes it possible to learn the needed basic skills in manageable steps, allowing students to focus on the actual prototype instead of struggling with the wireless and Internet communication problems. After the prototyping phase, the device can be ported to inexpensive and small ESP8266 based microcontroller. Compared to developing IoT prototypes directly with ESP8266, the setup presented is considerably faster. The whole process is based on free software tools which provides a possibility to utilize prototypes commercially, without a risk of a third party changing or discontinuing services. We arranged an experimental four-day workshop for university students (n = 19) from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of technical skills. All teams successfully built a working prototype based on their own ideas. Student self-assessment of programming skills was noticeably improved during the course. We later repeated the experiment with another group (n = 27) in a university of applied sciences, getting similar results. Our results indicate that this method is effective for learning IoT prototyping skills in a short time.","2012":"The new wave of huge data sources, also referred to as big data, entails new forms of information and content for Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Open data is the latest appeal in the open data philosophy and trends. In this article, we explore the affordances of (linked) open data for education in general and for CALL in particular. Learning analytics, adaptive learning environments, and open educational resources are the obvious beneficiaries, but contextualization of the learning process appears to be a relatively unexplored affordance. And this while available literature already touts its merits.","2014":"This paper addresses the problem of autonomous trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor in a global positioning system (GPS)-denied environment using only onboard sensing. To achieve that goal, it requires accurate estimation of quadrotor states followed by proper control actions. For the position estimation in a GPS-denied environment, an open source high speed optical flow sensor PX4FLOW is adopted. As for the quadrotor control, there are several challenges due to its highly nonlinear system dynamics, such as underactuation, coupling, model uncertainties, and external disturbances. To deal with those challenges, the cascaded inner-outer uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based robust control scheme has been developed and applied to the attitude and position control of a quadrotor. Extensive real flight experiments, including attitude stabilization, hover, disturbance rejection, trajectory tracking, and comparison with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed UDE-based controllers.","2015":"Although many studies have been conducted on digital forensics, their viewpoints keep changing, and new studies are continuously required on fields that have not been researched yet. This paper proposes a privacy protection measure by applying permanent deletion to the Internet-of-Things platform: a digital forensic technique regarding privacy protection that has been regarded as a cautious subject. In addition, we propose a file recovery method by analyzing a file allocation area in a UNIX file system, which has not been addressed, and identifying the clue for journal area using a magic number.","2016":"Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs), together with the miniaturisation of computers, sensors, and electronics, offer new remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of hardware and software support to effectively develop the potential of UASs in different remote sensing applications, such as the detection of radioactive sources. This paper presents the design, development and validation of a UAS for the detection of an uncontrolled and point radioactive source. The article describes a flexible and reusable software architecture for detecting the radioactive source (NaTcO4, containing Tc-99m) with a gamma-ray Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) spectrometer as a proof of concept. The UAS is equipped with multichannel air-ground communications to perform missions beyond line of sight and onboard computation to process samples in real time and thus react to any anomaly detected during the mission. An ad hoc ground control station (GCS) has also been developed for the correct interpretation of the radioactive samples taken by the UAS. Radiological spectra plots, contour mapping and waterfall plots are some of the elements used in the ad hoc GCS. The article shows the results obtained in a flight campaign performing different flights at different altitudes and speeds over the radiological source, demonstrating the viability of the system.","2017":"Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) established during the past two decades unlocked heterogeneous geospatial datasets. The European Union INSPIRE Directive laid down the foundation of a pan-European SDI where thousands of public sector data providers make their data, including sensor observations, available for cross-border and cross-domain reuse. At the same time, SDIs should inevitably adopt new technology and standards to remain fit for purpose and address in the best possible way the needs of different stakeholders (government, businesses and citizens). Some of the recurring technical requirements raised by SDI stakeholders include: (i) the need for adoption of RESTful architectures; together with (ii) alternative (to GML) data encodings, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and binary exchange formats; and (iii) adoption of asynchronous publish-subscribe-based messaging protocols. The newly established OGC standard SensorThings API is particularly interesting to investigate for INSPIRE, as it addresses together all three topics. In this manuscript, we provide our synthesised perspective on the necessary steps for the OGC SensorThings API standard to be considered as a solution that meets the legal obligations stemming out of the INSPIRE Directive. We share our perspective on what should be done concerning: (i) data encoding; and (ii) the use of SensorThings API as a download service.","2018":"In this paper, we propose a compact electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system and a user interface for control and monitoring over the Internet. Since the proposed system is much smaller than existing devices and does not need input\/output (I\/O) devices, it is easy to install and prevents inadvertent user interaction. The proposed system can increase the efficiency of biological testing devices such as ECIS systems that require long-term experiments at long intervals. The temporal impedance change is measured and recorded on the embedded computer in the proposed system, and the resulting data can be displayed and controlled over the Internet using a web-based graphical user interface (GUI). Bioengineers are currently using the proposed systems for cell culture experiments and are very satisfied with the ease of installation and the ability to observe the experimental situation anytime and anywhere.","2019":"Over the past decades, hardware and software technologies for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have significantly progressed, and WSNs are widely used in various areas including Internet of Things (IoT). In general, existing WSNs are mainly used for applications that require delay-tolerance and low-computation due to the poor resources of traditional sensor nodes in WSNs. However, compared to the traditional sensor nodes, today's devices for WSNs have more powerful resource. Thus, sensor nodes these days not only conduct sensing and transmitting data to servers but also are able to process many operations, so more diverse applications can be applied to WSNs. Especially, many applications using audio data have been proposed because audio is one of the most widely used data types, and many mobile devices already have a built-in microphone. However, many of the applications have a requirement that heavy-operations should be done by a tight deadline, so it is difficult for a single node in WSNs to run relatively heavy applications by itself. In this paper, to overcome this limitation of WSNs, we propose a new emerging system, HeaLow, a cooperative computing system for heavy-computation and low-latency processing in WSNs. We designed HeaLow and carried out the practical implementation on real devices. We confirmed the effectiveness of HeaLow through various experiments using the real devices and simulations. Using HeaLow, nodes in WSNs are able to perform heavy-computation processes while satisfying a completion time requirement.","2021":"In this article, we survey the recent developments of sensing methods in three-dimensional robot vision, centering on the current three-dimensional sensors and core techniques embedded in robotic systems. Over 8000 publications have reported rather wide application areas of three-dimensional robot vision in the last 40 years, such as human-robot interaction, object recognition, three-dimensional modeling, object tracking, searching and surveillance, as well as robot manipulation, localization, navigation, mapping, and path planning. Representative works and future research trends are also addressed in this article.","2022":"Synthesis is changing in response to our modern resource conscious world. The principles of green chemistry are evolving as the interfaces and boundaries in science are less obvious and providing a new stimuli for future discovery. The invention and application of new chemical reactivity continues to be a primary driver since this opens up so many strategic opportunities for synthesis. However, the manual intensive efforts behind such activity inevitably lead to the need for more machine based approaches. Indeed, the engineering of chemistry delineated in this Symposium in Print seeks to collate some of the recent progress and innovation in the area with contributions from its visionary practitioners.

It makes the whatever modal input to use the same interface to connect to the applications. It can essentially free the web application programmers and the end users from the need of physically handling the data input devices when they are building a multimodal system. The same application can be used for a whole range of physically different peripherals, but similar from the logical point of view of data entry. This paper discusses the implementation of a pilot project, currently in a local network environment, where all the devices in the LAN are identified and described in an interface server. Users in the local network may, upon request, make use of such devices. The communication of these peripherals with the web applications will be carried out by a network of modules that run under the websocket technology. The whole process of communication and connection establishment is automatic and guided by the existing configurations in the interface server. The entire platform runs under SOA strategy and is fully scalable and configurable. Its use is not limited to games because it has much wider possibilities, interactivity in teaching, accessibility for people with special needs, adaptation of web applications to the use of uninitiated, etc.","2026":"We introduce the Xpuck swarm, a research platform with an aggregate raw processing power in excess of two teraflops. The swarm uses 16 e-puck robots augmented with custom hardware that uses the substantial CPU and GPU processing power available from modern mobile system-on-chip devices. The augmented robots, called Xpucks, have at least an order of magnitude greater performance than previous swarm robotics platforms. The platform enables new experiments that require high individual robot computation and multiple robots. Uses include online evolution or learning of swarm controllers, simulation for answering what-if questions about possible actions, distributed super-computing for mobile platforms, and real-world applications of swarm robotics that requires image processing, or SLAM. The tera flop swarm could also be used to explore swarming in nature by providing platforms with similar computational power as simple insects. We demonstrate the computational capability of the swarm by implementing a fast physics-based robot simulator and using this within a distributed island model evolutionary system, all hosted on the Xpucks.","2027":"Beginning in 2012, NASA used a strategic process to identify broad societal questions, or grand challenges, that are well suited to the aerospace sector and align with national priorities. This effort generated NASA's first grand challenge, the Asteroid Grand Challenge (AGC), a large-scale effort using multidisciplinary collaborations and innovative engagement mechanisms, that focused on finding and addressing asteroid threats to human populations. In April 2010, President Barack Obama announced a mission to send humans to an asteroid by 2025. This resulted in the agency's Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) to leverage and maximize existing robotic and human efforts to capture and reroute an asteroid, with the goal of eventual human exploration. The AGC, initiated in 2013, complemented ARM by expanding public participation, partnerships, and other approaches to find, understand, and overcome these potentially harmful asteroids. This article describes a selection of AGC activities implemented from 2013 to 2017 and their results, excluding those conducted by NASA's Near-Earth Object Observations Program and other organizations. The strategic development of the initiative is outlined as well as initial successes, strengths, and weaknesses resulting from the first 4 years of AGC activities and approaches. Finally, we describe lesson learned and areas for continued work and study. The AGC lessons learned and strategies could inform the work of other agencies and organizations seeking to conduct a global scientific investigation with matrixed organizational support, multiple strategic partners, and numerous internal and external open innovation approaches and audiences.

The conceptual and terminology body of the cloud-based environment investigation and the main features of such an environment are delineated. The main methodological principles of the environment design and development, for instance, the principles of open science, open education and also the specific principles inherent to the cloud-based systems are described. The study aim is to analyze the conceptual body, principles, and features of the formation and development of the cloud-based educational and research environment in the context of the open science concept. The objective of the study is to determine the prospects of cloud technologies that are used to support educational and scientific activities and to outline the principles and technologies of open science use and explore their broader application in pedagogical systems of higher educational institutions. The research methods are the analysis of official international documents, publications on the research, observation, comparison, the analysis of the experience of the educational and scientific application of cloud technologies, and experimental studies. The results of the research substantiate cloud technologies in the principles of creation and development of the learning and research environment (LRE) of a higher education institution. The concept of the cloud-based environment is explained; the characteristic features of its functioning are outlined. Additionally, the prospects and estimation of the cloud-based LRE development in the aspect of open science are defined. Conclusions and recommendations encompass the application of cloud-based open science technologies covering European research infrastructures, scientific and educational networks, European open science cloud, and also cloud services for collecting, submitting and processing data as a topical and promising trend for the development and modernization of the learning and research environment of higher education institutions.","2031":"General programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are difficult to adapt to changeable applications, especially for those with special motion control; this has seriously affected the development efficiency. This paper presents the concept of the embedded PLC (ePLC), whose hardware structure can be customized according to actual requirements. We proposed a three-layer architecture, and its customizable application layer could be compiled in real time. Correspondingly, the PLC program was divided into an engine program, control program, and customizing program. The description and compilation method of the customizing program was provided. We presented a customized winding machine language based on the proposed ePLC software structure. This was implemented in an automatic winding machine, which was easier to use compared with some widely used languages (e.g., G-Code).","2032":"The present research proposes a novel emotion recognition framework for the computer prediction of human emotions using common wearable biosensors. Emotional perception promotes specific patterns of biological responses in the human body, and this can be sensed and used to predict emotions using only biomedical measurements. Based on theoretical and empirical psychophysiological research, the foundation of autonomic specificity facilitates the establishment of a strong background for recognising human emotions using machine learning on physiological patterning. However, a systematic way of choosing the physiological data covering the elicited emotional responses for recognising the target emotions is not obvious. The current study demonstrates through experimental measurements the coverage of emotion recognition using common off-the-shelf wearable biosensors based on the synchronisation between audiovisual stimuli and the corresponding physiological responses. The work forms the basis of validating the hypothesis for emotional state recognition in the literature and presents coverage of the use of common wearable biosensors coupled with a novel preprocessing algorithm to demonstrate the practical prediction of the emotional states of wearers.","2035":"BGI (hua da ji ying; China Great Gene) counts among the world's largest and wealthiest institutions for biomedical research. Located in Shenzhen, the new megacity in southern China, BGI is now a critical site for understanding the relationship between biomedicine and the economic development of China. This essay uses performance studies and the notion of shanzhai (copycatting) to understanding how this laboratory poses a challenge to traditional modes of understanding technoscience. This marks an attempt to understand BGI, its work, and its workers on their own terms, or at least on local terms. Just as shanzhai challenges our notions of originality, BGI's hybridity challenges our notions of where and how scientific knowledge is produced. Performing not merely as a laboratory, but also, and at the same time, as a factory, and a company, BGI is an unfamiliar kind of hybrid scientific-industrial-commercial-governmental-philanthropic space that draws its repertoire from its very particular regional, national, and local-urban circumstances.","2037":"While cellular networks connect over 3.7 billion people worldwide, their availability and quality is not uniform across regions. Under-provisioned and overloaded networks, as are common in rural or post-disaster areas, lead to poor network performance and a poor-quality user experience. To address this problem, we propose HybridCell: a system that leverages locally-owned small-scale cellular networks to augment the operation of overloaded commercial networks. HybridCell is the first system to allow a user with their existing SIM card and mobile phone to seamlessly switch between commercial and local networks in order to maintain continuous connectivity. HybridCell accomplishes this by identifying poorly-performing networks and taking action to provide seamless cellular connectivity to end users. Using traces from commercial cellular networks collected during our visit to the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan, we demonstrate HybridCell's capability to detect and act upon commercial network overload, offering an alternate communication channel during times of congestion. We show that even in scenarios where provider networks deny calls due to overload, HybridCell is able to accommodate users and facilitate local calling.","2040":"Achieving occupants comfort in built environments is a major goal of modern building automation systems. Nonetheless, even a quantification of human comfort represents a significant challenge because of the number of physical quantities affecting it which, therefore, have to be tracked at suitable spatial and temporal resolution. Wireless sensor and actuator networks are increasingly considered an enabling technology for many monitoring and remote control tasks. Indeed, their reduced intrusiveness, low cost, and low power requirements represent attractive features for the design of monitoring and control infrastructures. In this paper we present a wireless sensor network testbed aimed at monitoring human comfort in a two-century-old building used as university campus. The proposed solution is based on sensor nodes with multitasking capabilities allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks. Experimental evaluations highlight the flexibility and scalability of the adopted design which allows monitoring of heterogeneous parameters at different rates also permitting the coexistence of event driven and asynchronous operating modes.","2042":"In this study, we present a class of nonlinear analytical solutions for the dynamics of a fixed wing unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV). These solutions are needed for the integration and fusion of sensor data for input to guidance and control algorithms. Derivation and integration of the 3-rd order vector differential equation of motion, and its applications to various dynamical models are presented. It is assumed that (a) acceleration due to aerodynamic lift, and the difference between the propulsive thrust and aerodynamic drag accelerations are not changed; (b) the bank angle is zero; (c) the sideslip angle is zero. The general integral and the corresponding analytical solutions for a class of flight trajectories consist of six independent integrals for heading angle, magnitude of velocity vector, time, altitude, and two components of the position vector. This explicit expression with respect to the governing parameters facilitates its direct incorporation into the development and design of trajectories, targeting, guidance and control schemes. It is shown that the first integrals which have been shown valid for a variety of aircraft platforms, re-entry vehicles and missiles, can specifically be applied to UAVs in which such control solutions are needed for sense and avoid situations. An illustrative example highlights the applicability of the general integral for range of trajectories and conditions pertinent to UAV flight patterns.","2043":"Optogenetics is a technology wherein researchers combine light and genetically engineered photoreceptors to control biological processes with unrivaled precision. Near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (>700 nm) are desirable optogenetic inputs due to their low phototoxicity and spectral isolation from most photoproteins. The bacteriophytochrome photoreceptor 1 (BphP1), found in several purple photosynthetic bacteria, senses NIR light and activates transcription of photosystem promoters by binding to and inhibiting the transcriptional repressor PpsR2. Here, we examine the response of a library of output promoters to increasing levels of Rhodopseudomonas palustris PpsR2 expression, and we identify that of Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 crtE as the most strongly repressed in Escherichia coli. Next, we optimize Rps. palustris bphP1 and ppsR2 expression in a strain engineered to produce the required chromophore biliverdin IX alpha in order to demonstrate NIR-activated transcription. Unlike a previously engineered bacterial NIR photoreceptor, our system does not require production of a second messenger, and it exhibits rapid response dynamics. It is also the most red-shifted bacterial optogenetic tool yet reported by approximately SO nm. Accordingly, our BphP1-PpsR2 system has numerous applications in bacterial optogenetics.","2044":"Internet of Things (loT) offers a seamless platform to connect people and objects to one another for enriching and making our lives easier. This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of loT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of loT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven loT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device-network-human interfaces, security, and privacy.

Sensor nodes in the simulation were modelled after an Arduino hardware system equipped with compatible radio transceiver for communication. The sensor nodes were configured in two network topologies, grid and random topology, for performance comparisons. Network sizes varied between 9 nodes and 256 nodes. Simulation was stopped when the communication link between the sensor nodes and their sink node broke down. It was obtained that grid topology has better performance, especially in small network size. Moreover, when the number of nodes in the network is higher, the performance of random topology network exceeds the grid's performance. Nonetheless, the lifetime span of the sensor network does not depend on the networks size or topology, rather on the available energy in each of the sensor nodes. We also have successfully improved the energy consumption model to account for more parameters of radio transceiver used in a WSN node. The energy needed to turn on and off the radio transceiver plays a significant part in the energy consumption of the sensor node.","2047":"Side-channel attacks are a prominent threat to the security of embedded systems. To perform them, an adversary evaluates the goodness of fit of a set of key-dependent power consumption models to a collection of side-channel measurements taken from an actual device, identifying the secret key value as the one yielding the best-fitting model. In this work, we analyze for the first time the microarchitectural components of a 32-bit in-order RISC CPU, showing which one of them is accountable for unexpected side-channel information leakage. We classify the leakage sources, identifying the data serialization points in the microarchitecture and providing a set of hints that can be fruitfully exploited to generate implementations resistant against side-channel attacks, either writing or generating proper assembly code.","2049":"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging may be advantageous as a safe, non-invasive imaging modality to image the carotid artery. However, calcification that accompanies atherosclerotic plaque is difficult to detect with PA due to the non-distinct optical absorption spectrum of hydroxyapatite. We propose reflection-mode all-optical laser-ultrasound (LUS) imaging to obtain high-resolution, non-contact, non-ionizing images of the carotid artery wall and calcification. All-optical LUS allows for flexible acquisition geometry and userdependent data acquisition for high repeatability. We apply all-optical techniques to image an excised human carotid artery. Internal layers of the artery wall, enlargement of the vessel, and calcification are observed with higher resolution and reduced artifacts with nonconfocal LUS compared to confocal LUS. Validation with histology and X-ray computed tomography (CT) demonstrates the potential for LUS as a method for non-invasive imaging in the carotid artery. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Monitoring the Arctic Ocean ecosystem is key to understanding the impact of natural and human-induced change on the environment. Large data sets are required to monitor the Arctic marine ecosystem and validate high-resolution satellite observations (e.g., Sentinel), which are necessary to feed climatic and biogeochemical forecasting models. However, the Global Observing System needs to complete its geographic coverage, particularly for the harsh, extreme environment of the Arctic Region. In this scenario, autonomous systems are proving to be valuable tools for increasing the resolution of existing data. To this end, a low-cost, miniaturized and flexible probe, ArLoC (Arctic Low-Cost probe), was designed, built and installed on an innovative unmanned marine vehicle, the PROTEUS (Portable RObotic TEchnology for Unmanned Surveys), during a preliminary scientific campaign in the Svalbard Archipelago within the UVASS project. This study outlines the instrumentation used and its design features, its preliminary integration on PROTEUS and its test results.","2052":"This paper presents a new command generation technique titled VEPRO for computer controlled production machinery. In this method, the tool trajectory is described by a high-level scripting language that enables parametric representations of complex work-piece geometries. The interpreted script is then employed to generate the interpolation data required to compute a tool trajectory that is subjected to a number of kinematic constraints. A real-time interpolator is employed to provide the position commands required by each motion controller in a synchronous fashion. As a proof of concept, the proposed method is emulated on a PC using Python scripting language. The performance of the paradigm is rigorously assessed via two test cases involving different manufacturing techniques (e.g. pocket milling and 3D printing).

This OSOSM system can provide a continuous supply of oxygen and monitor the peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) of patients who accept radiotherapy and use an active breathing coordinator (ABC). A clinical test with 27 volunteers was conducted. The volunteers were divided into two groups based on the tendency of SpO2 decline in breath-holding without the OSOSM system: group A (12 cases) showed a decline in SpO2 of less than 2%, whereas the decline in SpO2 in group B (15 cases) was greater than 2% and reached up to 6% in some cases. The SpO2 of most volunteers declined during rest. The breath-holding time of group A without the OSOSM system was significantly longer than that of group B (p < 0.05) and was extended with the OSOSM system by 26.6% and 27.85% in groups A and B, respectively. The SpO2 recovery time was reduced by 36.1%, and the total rest time was reduced by 27.6% for all volunteers using the OSOSM system. In summary, SpO2 declines during breath-holding and rest time cannot be ignored while applying an ABC. This OSOSM system offers a simple and effective way to monitor SpO2 variation and overcome SpO2 decline, thereby lengthening breath-holding time and shortening rest time.","2057":"In the healthcare domain, Wireless Body Area Network has emerged as a vital technology that is capable of providing better methods to diagnose various hazardous diseases. The CANet projet is a project that proposes alternative monitoring solutions. This paper studies the possibility of transmitting different types of information through an IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer that not supports the transmission of heterogeneous information. We have proposed an extension to the MAC layer which makes possible the transmission of various information types. This solution designed by \"diffrentiation layer'' uses a purge function to ensure the use of CAP and CFP by the same node in the same superframe and allows the differentiation between several information. Our results show that our solution is reliable under worst-case.","2058":"The SRv6 architecture (segment routing based on IPv6 data plane) is a promising solution to support services like Traffic Engineering, service function chaining and virtual private networks in IPv6 backbones and datacenters. The SRv6 architecture has interesting scalability properties as it reduces the amount of state information that needs to be configured in the nodes to support the network services. In this paper, we describe the advantages of complementing the SRv6 technology with an software defined networking (SDN) based approach in backbone networks. We discuss the architecture of a SRv6 enabled network based on Linux nodes. In addition, we present the design and implementation of the Southbound API between the SDN controller and the SRv6 device. We have defined a data-model and four different implementations of the API, respectively based on gRPC, REST, NETCONF, and remote command line interface. Since it is important to support both the development and testing aspects we have realized an Intent-based emulation system to build realistic and reproducible experiments. This collection of tools automate most of the configuration aspects relieving the experimenter from a significant effort. Finally, we have realized an evaluation of some performance aspects of our architecture and of the different variants of the Southbound APIs and we have analyzed the effects of the configuration updates in the SRv6 enabled nodes.","2059":"This article presents an Internet of Things architecture for Smart Homes that specifically targets service composition and reconfiguration as enablers for the actuation and smart behavior capabilities. To this end, the main challenge that has to be addressed is the support to a seamless integration, composition, and reconfiguration of Internet of Things objects. Two enabling technologies are proposed here: a planning strategy based on a common-sense reasoning approach for service composition and a virtual-network protocol for Inter-Domain Messaging. The planner will identify the services that, properly connected, will cater for arisen, and therefore, unexpected needs. The virtual-network protocol will provide the support for this interconnection to take place in a transparent and orthogonal manner. This is particularly important to enable autonomous systems to instantiate composite services. To demonstrate the capabilities of the resulting framework, two use cases are presented, which under real circumstances demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.","2060":["Cloud Manufacturing (CM) is a service oriented business model to share manufacturing capabilities and resources on a cloud platform. Manufacturing is under pressure to achieve cost and environmental impact reductions, as manufacturing becomes more integrated and complex. Cloud manufacturing offers a solution, as it is capable of making intelligent decisions to provide the most sustainable and robust manufacturing route available. Although CM research has progressed, a consensus is still lacking on the concepts within CM as well 'as applications and scope beyond discrete manufacturing.","The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how CM offers a more sustainable manufacturing future to the industry as a whole, before focusing specifically on the application to process manufacturing (e.g. food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals). This paper details the definitions, characteristics, architectures and previous case studies on CM. From this, the fundamental aspects of the CM concept are identified, along with an analysis of how the concept has progressed. A new, comprehensive CM definition is formulated by combining key concepts drawn from previous definitions and emphasizes CM potential for sustainable manufacturing.","Four key methods of how CM increases sustainability are identified: (1) collaborative design; (2) greater automation; (3) improved process resilience and (4) enhanced waste reduction, reuse and recovery. The first two key methods are common to both discrete and process manufacturing, however key methods (3) and (4) are more process manufacturing specific and application of CM for these has yet to be fully realised. Examples of how CM's characteristics may be utilised to solve various process manufacturing problems are presented to demonstrate the applications of CM to process manufacturing. Waste is an important consideration in manufacturing, with strong sustainability implications. The current focus has been on using CM for waste minimisation; however, process manufacturing offers waste as a resource (valorisation opportunities from diversifying co-products, reuse, recycle and energy recovery). Exploring CM's potential to characterise and evaluate alternative process routes for the valorisation of process manufacturing waste is considered for the first time. The specific limitations preventing CM adoption by process manufacturers are discussed. Finally, CM's place in the future of manufacturing is explored, including how it will interact with, and complement other emerging manufacturing technologies to deliver a circular economy and personalised products.

Optic flow has been identified to play a crucial role in regulating flight conditions and navigation in flies and bees. In robotics, optic flow has been widely studied thanks to the low computational requirements. However, with only monocular visual information, optic flow is inherently devoid of a scale factor required for estimating the absolute distance. In this paper, we propose a strategy for estimating the flight altitude of a flying robot with a ventral camera by combining the optic flow with measurements from an inertial measurement unit. Instead of using the prevalent feature-based approach for calculation of optic flow, we implement a direct method that evaluates the flow information via image gradients. We show that the direct approach notably simplifies the computation steps compared to the feature-based method. When combined with an extended Kalman filter for fusion of inertial measurement units measurements, the flight altitude can be estimated in real time. We carried out extensive flight tests in different settings. Among 31 hovering and vertical flights near the altitude of 40 cm, we achieved the RMS errors in the altitude estimate of 2.51 cm. Further analysis of factors that affect the quality of the flow and the distance estimate is also provided.","2062":"Many cultural spaces offer their visitors the use of ICT tools to enhance their visit experience. Data collected within such spaces can be analysed in order to discover hidden information related to visitors' behaviours and needs. In this paper, a computational model inspired by neuroscience simulating the personalised interactions of users with cultural heritage objects is presented. We compare a strengthened validation approach for neural networks based on classification techniques with a novel proposal one, based on clustering strategies. Such approaches allow us to identify natural users' groups in data and to verify the model responses in terms of user interests. Finally, the presented model has been extended to simulate social behaviours in a community, through the sharing of interests and opinions related to cultural heritage assets. This data propagation has been further analysed in order to reproduce applicative scenarios on social networks.","2063":"The ocean covers nearly two-thirds of the surface on the Earth, and there has been great interest in developing underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) to help us explore the ocean realm. A great deal of efforts have been devoted to it, and significant progress has been made since the beginning of 2000s. However, most of the networks are isolatedly developed currently, inherently hardware-based and application-oriented with inflexible closed-form architectures, which are difficult to reconfigure, reprogram and evolve. They also lack the capability in sharing resources, and are far from service-oriented networks. These limitations impair their capacity for wide range of applications. To further propel the development of UWSNs, next-generation UWSNs have been proposed recently, which are robust, flexible, adaptive, programmable, support resource-sharing feature and are easy to manage and evolve. Moreover, a number of novel software-defined techniques and paradigms, such as software-defined radio, cognitive acoustic radio, network function virtualization, software-defined networking, Internet of Underwater Things, and sensor-cloud, have been emerging. These software-defined technologies have the capability of softwarizing network resources, and then redefining them to satisfy diverse application requirements, improve resource utilization efficiency and simplify network management. Consequently, these evolving technologies are envisioned as critical building blocks and major driving forces, which will transform conventional UWSNs toward software-based, programmable, user-customizable, and service-oriented next-generation UWSNs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing works on implementing these techniques, and also present discussions for future research. We hope to inspire more active research on these areas and take a step further toward realizing next-generation UWSNs.","2064":["Purpose This study aims to understand their emergence and types of business models in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.","Design\/methodology\/approach The paper builds upon a systematic literature review of IoT ecosystems and business models to construct a conceptual framework on IoT business models, and uses qualitative research methods to analyze seven industry cases.","Findings The study identifies four types of IoT business models: value chain efficiency, industry collaboration, horizontal market and platform. Moreover, it discusses three evolutionary paths of new business model emergence: opening up the ecosystem for industry collaboration, replicating the solution in multiple services and return to closed ecosystem as technology matures.","Research limitations\/implications Identifying business models in rapidly evolving fields such as the IoT based on a small number of case studies may result in biased findings compared to large-scale surveys and globally distributed samples.

There are various methods for ion and electron beam scanning. The best known of these methods is the wire scanning wherein the parameters of beam are measured by one or more conductive wires. This article suggests a novel method for e-beam scanning without the previous errors of old wire scanning. In this method, the techniques of atomic physics are applied so that a knife edge has a scanner role and the wires have detector roles. It will determine the 2D e-beam profile readily when the positions of the scanner and detectors are specified.","2066":"A fault detection and isolation algorithm for the attitude estimation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using low-cost magnetometers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, implemented in an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is proposed. Assuming the availability of double triaxial gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers, the possibility that fault can occur both in input (gyros outputs) and in output (accelerometers and magnetometers outputs) to the kinematic nonlinear relations underlying attitude estimation must be taken into account. If an extended Kalman filter (EKF) can compensate for biases on gyroscopes, fault detection, for all sensors, is first obtained with a comparison between homogeneous sensor outputs. Then, the isolation of the faulted gyro is carried out through the analysis of the EKF bias estimates, whereas a set-based approach is used to isolate faulted accelerometers or magnetometers. For these sensors, isolation tests involve the solution of a linear programming problem on a moving time window in the discrete time domain. In order to show the practical applicability and robustness against measurement noise and different kind of faults, a set of simulations involving experimental data collected during flights of a tricopter UAV are discussed.","2067":"In the last decade, wireless positioning systems have drawn a strong interest from a research point of view, especially for indoor environments where Global Positioning Systems (GPS) is not available. As an alternative, emerging applications relying on Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) communication technology have been proposed to offer a ranging accuracy in the order of some dozens of centimeters. Indeed, UWB radios' increased accuracy originates in the high time resolution of UWB signals that can be leveraged to measure precisely travel times of signals (e.g. Time of Flight, ToF). ToF can be easily translated to inter-node distance. In this work we propose N-TWR, a ToF-based N-ary ranging protocol created for localization using UWB. The proposed N-TWR protocol is based on the estimation of the ToF between a target node to be localized (which may be mobile or static) and a set of N anchors. It has been designed to minimize the number of messages exchanged between all nodes compared to a naive solution that exploits the state-of-the-art UWB ranging method. Validation has been made using experiments carried out in our Open Source Framework, DecaDuino, which enables fast prototyping of protocols sitting on top of UWB Physical layer. The N-ary ranging provided by N-TWR achieves the same level of accuracy as the naive protocol exploiting SDS-TWR but using four times less messages. We exhibit as well that N-TWR can be efficiently leveraged to design a simple and elegant trilateration localization algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, custom cultivation devices offer controlled growth environments with in-line monitoring of, for example, optical density, fluorescence, pH, and dissolved oxygen, all at affordable prices.

We propose a robot with a simulation of itself, other dynamic actors and its environment, inside itself. Operating in real time, this simulation-based internal model is able to look ahead and predict the consequences of both the robot's own actions and those of the other dynamic actors in its vicinity. Hence, the robot continuously modifies its own actions in order to actively maintain its own safety while also achieving its goal. Inspired by the problem of how mobile robots could move quickly and safely through crowds of moving humans, we present experimental results which compare the performance of our internal simulation-based controller with a purely reactive approach as a proof-of-concept study for the practical use of simulation-based internal models.","2071":"The development of an inexpensive robotic platform is presented. Our aim is to provide a complete low-cost hardware tool to illustrate control system methods.

The hardware that has been designed and developed performs experiments for single or multiple robot control employing capabilities, such as locomotion, communication, perception, and autonomous decision making. We illustrate different control and system dynamics techniques using this platform. After presenting the model and navigation strategies, single-agent techniques that ensure safe and predictable navigation are shown (PID and fuzzy logic controllers). Then, two multiagent techniques are described in order to prove the versatility of the platform. The first strategy illustrates common problems that arise in nature and power systems (phase synchronization models based on pulse-coupled biological oscillators and the Kuramoto oscillator). Second, a game theoretical approach for multirobot consensus is shown. In all these cases, experimental results show the performance of the platform.","2073":"As the Internet of Things (IoT) penetrates our everyday lives, being used to address a wide variety of real-life challenges and problems, the location of things becomes an important parameter.

The survey investigates the opportunities of location-aware IoT, and examines the potential of geospatial analysis in this research area.","2075":["The use of millirobots, particularly in swarm studies, would enable researchers to verify their proposed autonomous cooperative behavior algorithms under realistic conditions with a large number of agents. While multiple designs for such robots have been proposed, they, typically, require custom-made components, which make replication and manufacturing difficult, and, mostly, employ non-modular integral designs. Furthermore, these robots' proposed small sizes tend to limit sensory perception capabilities and operational time. Some have resolved few of the above issues through the use of extensions that, unfortunately, add to their size.","In contribution to the pertinent field, thus, a novel millirobot with an open-source design, addressing the above concerns, is presented in this paper. Our proposed millirobot has a modular design and uses easy to source, off-the-shelf components. The milli-robot-Toronto (mROBerTO) also includes a variety of sensors and has a 16 x 16 mm(2) footprint. mROBerTO's wireless communication capabilities include ANT TM, Bluetooth Smart, or both simultaneously. Data-processing is handled by an ARM processor with 256 KB of flash memory. Additionally, the sensing modules allow for extending or changing the robot's perception capabilities without adding to the robot's size. For example, the swarm-sensing module, designed to facilitate swarm studies, allows for measuring proximity and bearing to neighboring robots and performing local communications.","Extensive experiments, some of which are presented herein, have illustrated the capability of mROBerTO units for use in implementing a variety of commonly proposed swarm algorithms."],"2076":"An educational robot is described, which is designed and constructed for use in the laboratory of Principles of Electrical Engineering.

The ubiquitous use of IoT ranges from industrial control systems (ICS) to c-Health, e-Commerce, smart cities, supply chain management, smart cars, cyber physical systems (CPS), and a lot more. Such reliance on IoT is resulting in a significant amount of data to be generated, collected, processed, and analyzed. The big data analytics is no doubt beneficial for business development. However, at the same time, numerous threats to the availability and privacy of the user data, message, and device integrity, the vulnerability of IoT devices to malware attacks and the risk of physical compromise of devices pose a significant danger to the sustenance of IoT. This paper thus endeavors to highlight most of the known threats at various layers of the IoT architecture with a focus on the anatomy of malware attacks. We present a detailed attack methodology adopted by some of the most successful malware attacks on IoT, including ICS and CPS. We also deduce an attack strategy of a distributed denial of service attack through IoT botnet followed by requisite security measures. In the end, we propose a composite guideline for the development of an IoT security framework based on industry best practices and also highlight lessons learned, pitfalls and some open research challenges.","2078":"Theory of mind is the term given by philosophers and psychologists for the ability to form a predictive model of self and others. In this paper we focus on synthetic models of theory of mind. We contend firstly that such models-especially when tested experimentally-can provide useful insights into cognition, and secondly that artificial theory of mind can provide intelligent robots with powerful new capabilities, in particular social intelligence for human-robot interaction. This paper advances the hypothesis that simulation-based internal models offer a powerful and realisable, theory-driven basis for artificial theory of mind. Proposed as a computational model of the simulation theory of mind, our simulation-based internal model equips a robot with an internal model of itself and its environment, including other dynamic actors, which can test (i.e., simulate) the robot's next possible actions and hence anticipate the likely consequences of those actions both for itself and others. Although it falls far short of a full artificial theory of mind, our model does allow us to test several interesting scenarios: in some of these a robot equipped with the internal model interacts with other robots without an internal model, but acting as proxy humans; in others two robots each with a simulation-based internal model interact with each other. We outline a series of experiments which each demonstrate some aspect of artificial theory of mind.","2079":"The present paper interrogates the status and the role of electronic and reactive textiles in domestic contexts.

In this context, electronic and reactive textiles are asked to overcome the low acceptance of smart homes, through their technical, sensorial, and cultural dimensions, The paper highlights some of the pros and cons in accommodating the latest technological advances in the field of textiles, analyses the way physical computing allows textiles to transform into domotics (robots for domestic environments), presents some of the latest developments on soft architecture fabrication and argues in favor of a much more critical approach to the development of sensors and actuators in textile objects.","2080":"Research in photobiology is currently limited by a lack of devices capable of delivering precise and tunable irradiation to cells in a high-throughput format. This limits researchers to using expensive commercially available or custom-built light sources which make it difficult to replicate, standardize, optimize, and scale experiments. Here we present an open-source Microplate Photoirradiation System (MPS) developed to enable high-throughput light experiments in standard 96 and 24-well microplates for a variety of applications in photobiology research. This open-source system features 96 independently controlled LEDs (4 LEDs per well in 24-well), Wi-Fi connected control and programmable graphical user interface (GUI) for control and programming, automated calibration GUI, and modular control and LED boards for maximum flexibility. A web-based GUI generates light program files containing irradiation parameters for groups of LEDs. These parameters are then uploaded wirelessly, stored and used on the MPS to run photoirradiation experiments inside any incubator. A rapid and semi-quantitative porphyrin metabolism assay was also developed to validate the system in wild-type fibroblasts. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence accumulation was induced by incubation with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a photosensitization method leveraged clinically to destroy malignant cell types in a process termed photodynamic therapy (PDT), and cells were irradiated with 405nm light with varying irradiance, duration and pulsation parameters. Immediately after light treatment with the MPS, subsequent photobleaching was measured in live, adherent cells in both 96-well and a 24-well microplates using a microplate reader. Results demonstrate the utility and reliability of the Microplate Photoirradiation System to irradiate cells with precise irradiance and timing parameters in order to measure PpIx photobleaching kinetics in live adherent cells and perform comparable experiments with both 24 and 96 well microplate formats. The high-throughput capability of the MPS enabled measurement of enough irradiance conditions in a single microplate to fit PpIX fluorescence to a bioexponential decay model of photobleaching, as well as reveal a dependency of photobleaching on duty-cycle-but not frequency-in a pulsed irradiance regimen.","2083":"Champagne and sparkling wines are multicomponent hydroalcoholic systems supersaturated with dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2).

However, optical flow is typically estimated from frame sequences recorded by standard miniature cameras. This requires processing full images onboard, which limits the update rate of divergence measurements and thus the speed of the control loop and the robot. Event-based cameras overcome these limitations by only measuring pixel-level brightness changes atmicrosecond temporal accuracy, hence providing an efficient mechanism for optical flow estimation. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first work integrating event-based optical flow estimation into the control loop of a flying robot. We extend an existing \"local plane fitting\" algorithm to obtain an improved and more computationally efficient optical flow estimation method, which is valid for a wide range of optical flow velocities. This method is validated for real event sequences. In addition, a method for estimating the divergence from event-based optical flow is introduced that accounts for the aperture problem. The developed algorithms are implemented in a constant divergence landing controller onboard a quadrotor. Experiments show that, using event-based optical flow, accurate divergence estimates can be obtained over a wide range of speeds. This enables the quadrotor to perform very fast landing maneuvers.","2085":null,"2086":"In recent years, image processing has been a key application area for mobile and embedded computing platforms. In this context, many-core accelerators are a viable solution to efficiently execute highly parallel kernels. However, architectural constraints impose hard limits on the main memory bandwidth, and push for software techniques which optimize the memory usage of complex multi-kernel applications. In this work, we propose a set of techniques, mainly based on graph analysis and image tiling, targeted to accelerate the execution of image processing applications expressed as standard OpenVX graphs on cluster-based many-core accelerators. We have developed a run-time framework which implements these techniques using a front-end compliant to the OpenVX standard, and based on an OpenCL extension that enables more explicit control and efficient reuse of on-chip memory and greatly reduces the recourse to off-chip memory for storing intermediate results. Experiments performed on the STHORM many-core accelerator demonstrate that our approach leads to massive reduction of time and bandwidth, even when the main memory bandwidth for the accelerator is severely constrained.","2087":"The use of ultrasounds has been implemented to increase yeast viability, de-foaming, and cavitation in foods and beverages. However, the application of low frequency audible sound to decrease bubble size and improve foamability has not been explored. In this study, three treatments using India Pale Ale beers were tested, which include (1) a control, (2) the application of audible sound during fermentation, and (3) the application of audible sound during natural carbonation. Five different audible frequencies (20 Hz, 30 Hz, 45 Hz, 55 Hz, and 75 Hz) were applied daily for one minute each (starting from the lowest frequency) during fermentation (11 days, treatment 2) and carbonation (22 days, treatment 3). Samples were measured in triplicates using the RoboBEER to assess color and foam-related parameters. A trained panel (n = 10) evaluated the intensity of sensory descriptors. Results showed that samples with sonication treatment had significant differences in the number of small bubbles, alcohol, and viscosity compared to the control. Furthermore, except for foam texture, foam height, and viscosity, there were non-significant differences in the intensity of any sensory descriptor, according to the rating from the trained sensory panel. The use of soundwaves is a potential treatment for brewing to improve beer quality by increasing the number of small bubbles and foamability without disrupting yeast or modifying the aroma and flavor profile.","2088":"The present paper focuses on the design and fabrication of 1D and 2D optical scanners to characterize the spatial profile of electron beams. The basis of the two systems is the generation of color centers in glass plates by irradiation, followed by the scanning of the plates, illuminated by a fixed power source (LED) with a maximum power of 3 W in the spectral range of 520-560 nm, with a TCS3200 sensor. In both systems, 6 mm thick glass blades (SiO2 : 76%) are used instead of expensive dosimetric films. The experimental results section first focuses on the validation and calibration accuracy of the effective absorbance of the irradiated glass in the LED spectral range with a radiation dose of up to 20 kGy. Then, it describes how the 1D optical scanner was used to scan the spatial profile obtained under the scanning horn of a Rhodotron accelerator with a maximum radiation dose of 7.8 kGy. The experimental results obtained from this method are entirely consistent with the results of other research studies, while this method is more cost-efficient and accurate compared to the previously reported methods. The 2D optical scanner was also used to accurately measure the spatial profile of the Rhodotron electron beam in static mode by scanning the color centers generated by irradiation.","2089":"This conceptual paper deals ultimately with the intricate relationships existing between quantity and quality in the field of energy conservation policies. It discusses how current policy approaches to energy conservation have energy efficiency and individuals' behavioural change as principle target. It then argues that their limited impacts derive largely from how they are principally informed by quantitative estimates of reductions in energy inputs and neglect how qualitative changes generated in the energy outputs can either offset these reductions (e.g. more energy efficient motors can enable the production of larger cars consuming more energy) or cause higher savings (e.g. smaller cars can consume less energy even with less efficient motors). The paper also explains these limited impacts in terms of overly simplistic cause-effect relationships assumed to exist between given exogenous factors (e.g. provision of information, price signals, etc.) and individuals' behaviours. It then shows how radically alternative policies for energy conservation can target qualitative changes and re-organisations in energy outputs. In doing so, it takes social practice theories as theoretical background. Finally, it discusses the potentially very high impacts and the alternative character of policies informed by these theories and shows how and where they indicate to intervene.","2090":"The European Union Water Framework Directive (EU WFD, 2000) calls for active inclusion of the public in the governance of waterbodies to enhance the effectiveness and legitimacy of water management schemes across the EU. As complex socio-ecological systems, river basins in western Europe could benefit from further support for inclusive management schemes. This paper makes use of case studies from Germany, England and Spain to explore the potential opportunities and challenges of different participatory management approaches. Grounded in theoretical considerations around participation within ecological management schemes, including Arnstein's Ladder of Participation and commons theories, this work provides an evaluation of each case study based on key indicators, such as inclusivity, representativeness, self-organization, decision-making power, spatial fit and temporal continuity. As investors and the public develop a heightened awareness for long-term sustainability of industrial projects, this analysis supports the suggestion that increased participatory river basin management is both desirable and economically feasible, and should thus be considered a viable option for future projects aiming to move beyond current requirements of the European Union Water Framework Directive.

Our system (the Interactive Plant system) senses the electrical capacitance of the human body and visualizes users' tactile information on a flat screen (when the touch is gentle, the program draws small and thin roots around the pot; when the touch is more harsh or abrupt, big and thick roots are displayed). We contrasted this multimodal combination (touch + vision) with a unimodal interface (touch only or watch only) and measured the impact of the multimodal interaction on participants' emotion. We found significant emotional gains in the multimodal interaction. Participants' self-reported positive affect, joviality, attentiveness and self-assurance increased dramatically in multimodal interaction relative to unimodal interaction; participants' electrodermal activity (EDA) increased in the multimodal condition, suggesting that our plant-based multisensory visual-tactile interaction raised arousal. We suggest that plant-based tactile interfaces are advantageous for emotion generation because haptic perception is by nature embodied and emotional.","2092":"Nowadays Personal Informatics (PI) devices are used for sensing and saving personal data, everywhere and at any time, helping people improve their lives by highlighting areas of good and bad performances and providing a general awareness of different levels of conduct. However, not all these data are suitable to be automatically collected. This is especially true for emotions and mood. Moreover, users without experience in self-tracking may have a misperception of PI applications' limits and potentialities. We believe that current PI tools are not designed with enough understanding of such users' needs, desires, and problems they may encounter in their everyday lives. We designed and prototype the Mood TUI (Tangible User Interface), a PI tool that supports the self-reporting of mood data using a tangible interface. The platform is able to gather six different mood states and it was tested through several participatory design sessions in a secondary\/high school. The solution proposed allows gathering mood values in an amusing, simple, and appealing way. Users appreciated the prototypes, suggesting several possible improvements as well as ideas on how to use the prototype in similar or totally different contexts, and giving us hints for future research.","2095":"Smart musical instruments (SMIs) are a family of Internet of Musical Things devices for music creation. They are characterized by sensors, actuators, embedded intelligence, and wireless connectivity to local networks and to the Internet. In this paper, we depict a vision for this recent research area, which merges the research fields on digital musical instruments and smart objects, and fosters new types of interactions between the player and the instrument, between the player and other players, and between the player and audience members. We propose a set of capabilities and technical features characterizing SMIs, as well as a design for a technological architecture supporting them. To illustrate possible applications enabled by this vision, we present a set of scenarios exploiting the intelligence embedded in SMIs. We also propose a set of guidelines that can help digital luthiers in the process of designing SMIs. Finally, we present a set of directions for future research.","2096":["Optogenetic switches permit accurate control of gene expression upon light stimulation. These synthetic switches have become a powerful tool for gene regulation, allowing modulation of customized phenotypes, overcoming the obstacles of chemical inducers, and replacing their use by an inexpensive resource: light. In this work, we implemented FUN-LOV, an optogenetic switch based on the photon-regulated interaction of WC-1 and WD, two LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) blue-light photoreceptors from the fungus Neurospora crassa. When tested in yeast, FUN-LOV yields light-controlled gene expression with exquisite temporal resolution and a broad dynamic range of over 1,300-fold, as measured by a luciferase reporter. We also tested the FUN-LOV switch for heterologous protein expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where Western blot analysis confirmed strong induction upon light stimulation, surpassing by 2.5 times the levels achieved with a classic GAL4\/galactose chemical-inducible system. Additionally, we utilized FUN-LOV to control the ability of yeast cells to flocculate. Light-controlled expression of the flocculin-encoding gene FLO1, by the FUN-LOV switch, yielded flocculation in light (FIL), whereas the lightcontrolled expression of the corepressor TUP1 provided flocculation in darkness (FID). Altogether, the results reveal the potential of the FUN-LOV optogenetic switch to control two biotechnologically relevant phenotypes such as heterologous protein expression and flocculation, paving the road for the engineering of new yeast strains for industrial applications. Importantly, FUN-LOV's ability to accurately manipulate gene expression, with a high temporal dynamic range, can be exploited in the analysis of diverse biological processes in various organisms.","IMPORTANCE Optogenetic switches are molecular devices which allow the control of different cellular processes by light, such as gene expression, providing a versatile alternative to chemical inducers. Here, we report a novel optogenetic switch (FUN-LOV) based on the LOV domain interaction of two blue-light photoreceptors (WC-1 and WD) from the fungus N. crassa. In yeast cells, FUN-LOV allowed tight regulation of gene expression, with low background in darkness and a highly dynamic and potent control by light. We used FUN-LOV to optogenetically manipulate, in yeast, two biotechnologically relevant phenotypes, heterologous protein expression and flocculation, resulting in strains with potential industrial applications. Importantly, FUN-LOV can be implemented in diverse biological platforms to orthogonally control a multitude of cellular processes."],"2098":"Herein, an approach for versatile titration by monitoring the chemical reaction process with a developed capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector ((CD)-D-4) was developed. A disposable glass reaction cell, in which sub-milliliter titrand was loaded, was inserted into the working head stage of the (CD)-D-4. Upon addition of titrant, the ionic strength and\/or mobility of components in the solution changed, causing consequently change of conductivity. The (CD)-D-4 monitored the change in real time. A V-shaped titration curve was gained, allowing an easy identification of the endpoint. Between the elapsed time and the initial concentration of titrand, linear relationships were found for classical acid-base, precipitation, complexation and redox reaction over certain ranges, enabling the establishment of quantitative determinations. The new approach had a few charming advantages (e.g. simplicity and cost effectiveness) over contact electrochemical methods because that the solution was isolated from the working electrodes. Therefore, a development of versatile and multifunctional platform for micro-titrations is promising.","2099":"Today in Japan, comfortable lifestyle and environment realized by abundant electric power is being questioned by energy consumption reduction policies called \"cool biz\" in summer, and \"warm biz\" in winter. One reason of these policies is the bad energy consumption efficiency of current air-conditioning systems that cool or warm indirectly human body. Several researches have been investigating the effect of direct human body cooling and warming. However, most proposed solutions focus on direct head or neck cooling, using ice to cool a water circulating system, such temperature during use cannot be controlled accurately nor adapted to user and environment conditions. Recently, a Japanese research team developed a portable system using Peltier elements that can both cool and warm neck. Though cooling was demonstrated to affect positively both physiological and psychological state in summer heat environment, in cold climate it could be confirmed for only neck warming but not feet and hands. In our objective of developing effective energy saving technology for direct temperature-conditioning of human body, and in order to reduce the discomfort caused by body chillness, we have proposed and developed a Peltier element based wrist-mounted wearable device that directly warms human body. A first experimental study showed how wrist warming rhythm affects hyperthermic sensation. Then, we verified whether the thermal sensation of the body, including the extremities, is improved by changing the position where the wrist is warmed.","2103":"The nature of contemporary spatial data infrastructures lies in the provision of geospatial information in an on-demand fashion. Although recent applications identified the need to react to real-time information in a time-critical way, research efforts in the field of geospatial Internet of Things in particular have identified substantial gaps in this context, ranging from a lack of standardisation for event-based architectures to the meaningful handling of real-time information as \"events\". This manuscript presents work in the field of event-driven architectures as part of spatial data infrastructures with a particular focus on sensor networks and the devices capturing in-situ measurements. The current landscape of spatial data infrastructures is outlined and used as the basis for identifying existing gaps that retain certain geospatial applications from using real-time information. We present a selection of approaches-developed in different research projects-to overcome these gaps. Being designed for specific application domains, these approaches share commonalities as well as orthogonal solutions and can build the foundation of an overall event-driven spatial data infrastructure.","2104":"Pan-sharpening aims at integrating spectral information from a multi-spectral (MS) image and spatial information from a panchromatic (PAN) image in a fused image with both high spectral and spatial resolutions. Numerous pan-sharpening methods are based on intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform, which may cause evident spectral distortion. To address this problem, an IHS-based pan-sharpening method using ripplet transform and compressed sensing is proposed. Firstly, the IHS transform is applied to the MS image to separate intensity components. Secondly, discrete ripplet transform (DRT) is implemented on the intensity component and the PAN image to obtain multi-scale sub-images. High-frequency sub-images are fused by a local variance algorithm and, for low-frequency sub-images, compressed sensing is introduced for the reconstruction of the intensity component so as to integrate the local information from both the intensity component and the PAN image. The specific fusion rule is defined by local difference. Finally, the inverse ripplet transform and inverse IHS transform are coupled to generate the pan-sharpened image. The proposed method is compared with five state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods and also the Gram-Schmidt (GS) method through visual and quantitative analysis of WorldView-2, Pleiades and Triplesat datasets. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieves relatively higher spatial resolution and more desirable spectral fidelity.","2105":"This paper describes a fully spike-based neural network for optical flow estimation from dynamic vision sensor data. A low power embedded implementation of the method, which combines the asynchronous time-based image sensor with IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System, is presented. The sensor generates spikes with submillisecond resolution in response to scene illumination changes. These spike are processed by a spiking neural network running on TrueNorth with a 1-ms resolution to accurately determine the order and time difference of spikes from neighbouring pixels, and therefore infer the velocity. The spiking neural network is a variant of the Barlow Levick method for optical flow estimation. The system is evaluated on two recordings for which ground truth motion is available, and achieves an average endpoint error of 11% at an estimated power budget of under 80 mW for the sensor and computation.","2106":"The lack of sustainable solutions to mobility and transportation is a major problem in Latin American cities and requires prompt solutions. The main issues in Latin America are the high-cost of solutions, no inclusion of renewable energies, poor energy management, the use of foreign systems not adapted to local contexts, ineffective regional legislation and politics, among others. In this paper the main technical issues concerning the implementation of a bike-sharing system using pedaling-assisted (PAS) electric bicycles for Bogota City are discussed and a solution is proposed. To solve such problems, a methodology to design a tailored solution well suited to Bogota citizen's needs is developed. Such methodology starts with the development of an on-board-computer (OBC) in order to characterize bike-users by collecting a rider's data in real-time. Furthermore, the proposed solution develops a low-cost middle-drive (mid-drive) propulsion system for the PAS in the electric bike using brushless-DC (BLDC) motors and by implementing a field-oriented controller (FOC). The reported bike-sharing system also includes the development and implementation of two charging-stations that enable charging the battery on the electric bikes exclusively by using photovoltaic energy. Experimental results are presented and discussed.","2108":"In swarm robotics, a design pattern provides high-level guidelines for the implementation of a particular robot behaviour and describes its impact on swarm performance. In this paper, we explore information exchange design patterns for robot swarm foraging. First, a method for the specification of design patterns for robot swarms is proposed that builds on previous work in this field and emphasises modular behaviour design, as well as information-centric micro-macro link analysis. Next, design pattern application rules that can facilitate the pattern usage in robot control algorithms are given. A catalogue of six design patterns is then presented. The patterns are derived from an extensive list of experiments reported in the swarm robotics literature, demonstrating the capability of the proposed method to identify distinguishing features of robot behaviour and their impact on swarm performance in a wide range of swarm implementations and experimental scenarios. Each pattern features a detailed description of robot behaviour and its associated parameters, facilitated by the usage of a multi-agent modeling language, BDRML, and an account of feedback loops and forces that affect the pattern's applicability. Scenarios in which the pattern has been used are described. The consequences of each design pattern on overall swarm performance are characterised within the Information-Cost-Reward framework, that makes it possible to formally relate the way in which robots acquire, share and utilise information. Finally, the patterns are validated by demonstrating how they improved the performance of foraging e-puck swarms and how they could guide algorithm design in other scenarios.","2109":"The optimization of engineered metabolic pathways requires careful control over the levels and timing of metabolic enzyme expression(1-4). Optogenetic tools are ideal for achieving such precise control, as light can be applied and removed instantly without complex media changes. Here we show that light-controlled transcription can be used to enhance the biosynthesis of valuable products in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We introduce new optogenetic circuits to shift cells from a light-induced growth phase to a darkness-induced production phase, which allows us to control fermentation with only light. Furthermore, optogenetic control of engineered pathways enables a new mode of bioreactor operation using periodic light pulses to tune enzyme expression during the production phase of fermentation to increase yields. Using these advances, we control the mitochondrial isobutanol pathway to produce up to 8.49 +\/- 0.31 g l(-1) of isobutanol and 2.38 +\/- 0.06 g l(-1) of 2-methyl-1-butanol micro-aerobically from glucose. These results make a compelling case for the application of optogenetics to metabolic engineering for the production of valuable products.","2111":"The monitoring and control of renewable energy sources (RESs) based on DC (Direct Current) microgrids (DC MG) are gaining much consideration at this time. In comparison with the isolated individual control of converters in a microgrid, DC microgrids provide better voltage regulation and harmonized energy generation\/consumption. To address the inherent vulnerability of communication links, robust methods have been proposed that improve the resilience of communication-based control. However, the failure of the communication links in microgrid control layers remains a considerable issue that may lead to one or more nodes being disconnected and operating as a communication island. Such types of communication islanding may cause the unpredictable behavior of the system and further destabilization may lead to a cascaded failure. This paper proposes a fast algorithm to detect and evaluate network connectivity based on the information stored at every node in the form of a look-up table. The control structure has been modified under communication islanding, and a communication connectivity observer is used at every node to detect and address power flow issues under communication islanding. The proposed method has been verified through mathematical analysis, simulation, and experimental results.","2112":"Many Smart City projects are beginning to consider the role of citizens. However, current methods for engaging urban populations in participatory design (PD) activities are somewhat limited. In this article, we describe an approach taken to empower socially disadvantaged citizens, using a variety of both social and technological tools, in a Smart City project. Through analysing the nature of citizens' concerns and proposed solutions, we explore the benefits of our approach, arguing that engaging citizens can uncover hyper-local concerns that provide a foundation for finding solutions to address citizen concerns. By reflecting on our approach, we identify four key challenges to utilising PD at an urban scale; balancing scale with the personal, who has control of the process, who is participating and integrating citizen-led work with local authorities. By addressing these challenges, we will be able to truly engage citizens as collaborators in co-designing their city.","2113":"Velocity estimation is essential for multicopters to guarantee flight stability and maneuverability. For such a purpose, this paper proposes a new method for multicopter velocity estimation based on visual and inertial information in GPS-denied or confined environments. In this method, no map, artificial landmark of the environment is required, and only the off-the-shelf onboard sensors in a multicopter including a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a downward-looking monocular camera and an ultrasonic range finder facing downwards are exploited to constitute the vision motion constraint. This constraint connects metric velocity with the point correspondences between successive images in which an efficient approach based on Mean Shift (MS) algorithm is developed to detect outliers and select optimal matching points. Then, it is theoretically verified that the estimation system is observable based on observability analysis. Furthermore, combined with the vision motion constraint and a multicopter dynamic model, the metric velocity is estimated using a standard Linear Kalman Filter (LKF). Finally, the proposed method is tested with a collection of synthetic data from simulation as well as flight experiments using real data from Oil Matrice 100 and Guidance. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed method can accurately estimate the velocity of the multicopter in GPS-denied or confined environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, consumer researchers have long suggested that brands and commodities can act as a source of community and ethics. In recent years a number of communitarian productive networks have emerged in sectors like food, software, fashion, design and social enterprise. Such communities of commons-based peer production have transformed the role of consumer communities by making communitarian relations count also in the material production of goods and services. In this paper we examine the neorural' communitarian networks located in Southern Italy. We suggest that the creation of community around high quality, authentic' agricultural produce serves a dual role. On the one hand such communities singularise agricultural products and enable them to acquire market value as goods. At the same time, communities provide space for a new politics of things oriented towards pragmatic social transformation and the creation of ontological security in a world understood to be highly contingent.","2118":"A computationally efficient approach to obtain vanishing points in images for camera orientation applications is presented in this paper. Modifications are made to the conventional J-linkage algorithm, named Fast J-linkage, so that the detection of vanishing points is achieved in a computationally efficient manner. This fast algorithm is then utilized to recover camera orientation or rotation matrices from video sequences. Both the computational efficiency and performance aspect of the Fast J-linkage algorithm are compared with the conventional J-linkage algorithm by examining the York Urban image database. In addition, the results of an actual camera rotation implementation is provided and validated by using inertial sensors data. The results obtained indicate the higher computational efficiency and accuracy aspects of the developed vanishing point detection.","2122":"Teamwork is an increasingly important aspect of knowledge production. In particular, factors influencing team formation relative to the composition of expertise are crucial for both organizational performance and for informing policy. In this paper, I draw attention to technology access as a highly influential factor impacting expertise in team formation. I examine the hack of Microsoft Kinect as an exogenous event that suddenly reduced motion-sensing technology costs. I show that great reductions in technology costs substitute for ex ante optimal involvement of area specialists and facilitate involvement of outside-area specialists through collaboration with researchers with broader knowledge- generalists. In other words, technology costs influence the composition of expertise in teamwork, with sufficiently large reductions leading to knowledge creation that combines more broadly across knowledge areas. These findings have important implications for organizations and policy makers in crafting incentives for more diverse knowledge creation through strategic investments that lower technology costs and influence team formation.","2123":"An integrated navigation scheme based on multiple optical flow sensors and a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) are presented, instead of the global position system (GPS) aided. Multiple optical flow sensors are mounted on a micro air vehicle (MAV) at different positions with different viewing directions for detecting optical flow around the MAV. A fault-tolerant decentralized extended Kalman filter (EKF) is performed for estimating navigation errors by fusing the inertial and optical flow measurements, which can prevent the estimation divergence caused by the failure of the optical flow sensor. Then, the estimation of navigation error is inputted into the SINS settlement process for correcting the SINS measurements. The results verify that the navigation errors of SINS can be effectively reduced (even more than 9\/10). Moreover, although the sensor is in a state of failure for 400 seconds, the fault-tolerant integrated navigation system can still work properly without divergence.","2124":"The responses of photosynthetic organisms to light stress are of interest for both fundamental and applied research. Functional traits related to the photoinhibition, the light-induced loss of photosynthetic efficiency, are particularly interesting as this process is a key limiting factor of photosynthetic productivity in algae and plants. The quantitative characterization of light responses is often time-consuming and calls for cost-effective high throughput approaches that enable the fast screening of multiple samples. Here we present a novel illumination system based on the concept of 'multiactinic imaging' of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence. The system is based on the combination of an array of individually addressable low power RGBW LEDs and customdesigned well plates, allowing for the independent illumination of 64 samples through the digital manipulation of both exposure duration and light intensity. The illumination system is inexpensive and easily fabricated, based on open source electronics, off-theshelf components, and 3D-printed parts, and is optimized for imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence. The high-throughput potential of the system is illustrated by assessing the functional diversity in light responses of marine macroalgal species, through the fast and simultaneous determination of kinetic parameters characterizing the response to light stress of multiple samples. Although the presented illumination system was primarily designed for the measurement of phenotypic traits related to photosynthetic activity and photoinhibition, it can be potentially used for a number of alternative applications, including the measurement of chloroplast phototaxis and action spectra, or as the basis for microphotobioreactors.","2125":"The subglacial drainage system is one of the main controls on basal sliding, but remains only partially understood. Here we use an 8-year dataset of borehole observations on a small, alpine polythermal valley glacier in the Yukon Territory to assess qualitatively how well the established understanding of drainage physics explains the observed temporal evolution and spatial configuration of the drainage system. We find that the standard picture of a channelizing drainage system that evolves towards higher effective pressure explains many features of the dataset. However, our dataset underlines the importance of hydraulic isolation of parts of the bed. We observe how disconnected portions of the bed systematically grow towards the end of the summer season, causing the drainage system to fragment into progressively more distinct subsystems. We conclude with an adaptation of existing drainage models that aims to capture the ability of parts of the bed to become hydraulically disconnected due to basal cavities of finite size becoming disconnected from each other as they shrink.","2128":"The human body has unique electrical characteristics. These characteristics have been investigated in various studies in human-computer interaction (HCI) and related research fields. Such studies include applications for using the body as a conductive lead for transmission or electric field sensing and activating human muscles or organs. However, electricity is not completely safe for the human body; therefore, to avoid harming users, careful consideration is essential when developing such devices. The knowledge required for such consideration is spread throughout a large number research fields, and it can be difficult for researchers in the HCI field to comprehend all of them. The purpose of this article is to support researchers in developing systems that apply electricity to the human body and to serve as a basis for further research. This article reviews previous research pertaining to HCI in which users come into contact with electricity. In addition, considerations of how and where this type of research can be expanded, along with guidelines grounded in other fields for designing systems safely and addressing ethical concerns, are presented. An understanding of the field and of the related safety issues will enhance the understanding of limitations and potential and can clarify the design space.","2129":"Technological advances have allowed in situ monitoring of soil water content in an automated manner. These advances, along with an increase in large-scale networks monitoring soil water content, stress the need for a robust calibration framework that ensures that soil water content measurements are accurate and reliable. We have developed an approach to make consistent and comparable soil water content sensor calibrations across a continental-scale network in a production framework that incorporates a thorough accounting of uncertainties. More than 150 soil blocks of varying characteristics from 33 locations across the United States were used to generate soil-specific calibration coefficients for a capacitance sensor. We found that the manufacturer's nominal calibration coefficients poorly fit the data for nearly all soil types. This resulted in negative (91% of samples) and positive (5% of samples) biases and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 cm(3) cm(-3) (1 sigma) relative to reference standard measurements. We derived soil-specific coefficients, and when used with the manufacturer's nominal function, the biases were corrected and the mean RMSE dropped to +\/- 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3) (+\/- 1 sigma). A logistic calibration function further reduced the mean RMSE to +\/- 0.016 cm(3) cm(-3) (+\/- 1 sigma) and increased the range of soil moistures to which the calibration applied by 18% compared with the manufacturer's function. However, the uncertainty of the reference standard was notable (+\/- 0.022 cm(3) cm(-3)), and when propagated in quadrature with RMSE estimates, the combined uncertainty of the calibrated volumetric soil water content values increased to +\/- 0.028 cm(3) cm(-3) regardless of the calibration function used.","2130":"Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl- ions based on the neuronal Cl- driving force. Established theories regarding the determinants of Cl- driving force have recently been questioned. Here, we present biophysical models of Cl- homeostasis using the pump-leak model. Using numerical and novel analytic solutions, we demonstrate that the Na+\/K+-ATPase, ion conductances, impermeant anions, electrodiffusion, water fluxes and cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play roles in setting the Cl- driving force. Our models, together with experimental validation, show that while impermeant anions can contribute to setting [Cl-](i) in neurons, they have a negligible effect on the driving force for Cl- locally and cell-wide. In contrast, we demonstrate that CCCs are well-suited for modulating Cl- driving force and hence inhibitory signaling in neurons. Our findings reconcile recent experimental findings and provide a framework for understanding the interplay of different chloride regulatory processes in neurons.","2131":"Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl- ions based on the neuronal Cl- driving force.

This situation has produced different effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.","2133":"Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities. Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.","2135":"Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.","2137":null,"2138":"Supported by easier and cheaper access to tools and expanding communities, maker cultures are pointing towards the ideas of (almost) everyone designing, creating, producing and distributing renewed, new and improved products, machines, things or artefacts. A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed.","2139":"We introduce Dimitri, an open-software & open-hardware humanoid robot with 31 DOFs, fitted with cost-effective modular compliant joints and parallel link legs, designed for advanced human-robot interaction research, force-informed object handling and intelligent environment discovery.

In order to illustrate the robot's qualities in the field of machine learning applied to robotics and manipulation, a multiple timescale recurrent neural network (MTRNN) is implemented, allowing the robot to replicate combined movement sequences earlier taught via interactive demonstration.","2140":"Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research. Under the SLRA, university researchers can spend more time innovating for the same investment.","2142":"Purpose: Vertical jump tests are used to assess lower-limb power of athletes in sport sciences. Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17-0.63% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65-9.38% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.","2145":"We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments.","2147":"In self-powered microsystems, a power management is essential to extract, transfer and regulate power from energy harvesting sources to loads such as sensors. The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.","2153":"In this paper, we present the construction of a reliable and inexpensive pH stat device, by using open-source \"OpenPhControl\" software, inexpensive hardware (a peristaltic and a syringe pump, Arduino, a step motor...), readily available laboratory devices: a pH meter, a computer, a webcam, and some 3D printed parts. We provide a methodology for the design, development and test results of each part of the device, as well as of the entire system. In addition to dosing reagents by means of a low-cost peristaltic pump, we also present carefully controlled dosing of reagents by an open-source syringe pump. The upgrading of the basic open-source syringe pump is given in terms of pump control and application of a larger syringe. In addition to the basic functions of pH stat, i.e. pH value measurement and maintenance, an improvement allowing the device to be used for potentiometric titration has been made as well. We have demonstrated the device's utility when applied for cellulose fibers oxidation with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical, i.e. for TEMPO-mediated oxidation. In support of this, we present the results obtained for the oxidation kinetics, the consumption of added reagent and experimental repeatability. Considering that the open-source scientific tools are available to everyone, and that researchers can construct and adjust the device according to their needs, as well as, that the total cost of the open-source pH stat device, excluding the existing laboratory equipment (pH meter, computer and glossary) was less than 150 EUR, we believe that, at a small fraction of the cost of available commercial offers, our open-source pH stat can significantly improve experimental work where the use of pH stat is necessary.","2157":"Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware co-design leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.","2161":"This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much as possible on open hardware.","2163":"This paper deals with the definition and analysis of a complete electronic system for the detection and monitoring of stability characteristics in complex scenarios such as structural elements or environmental events.

The system is completely autonomous thanks to the implementation of an energy harvesting architecture and realizes a wireless sensor network whose nodes are auto-configurable, making it possible to freely arrange them in situ. The continuously collected data are relative to acceleration, inclination, position, and temperature of each node. These data are transmitted and stored on a remote web server devoted to the automatic management of alarms and accessible for data consulting.

Technologies such as powder-bed fusion (PBF) can process PP powder; however, much is still to learn concerning process parameters for reliable manufacturing. This study focusses in the process-property relationships of PP using laser-based PBF. The research presents an overview of the intrinsic and the extrinsic characteristic of a commercial PP powder as well as fabrication of tensile specimens with varying process parameters to characterize tensile, elongation at break, and porosity properties. The impact of key process parameters, such as power and scanning speed, are systematically modified in a controlled design of experiment. The results were compared to the existing body of knowledge; the outcome is to present a process window and optimal process parameters for industrial use of PP. The computer tomography data revealed a highly porous structure inside specimens ranging between 8.46% and 10.08%, with porosity concentrated in the interlayer planes in the build direction.

Robotics and computational practice are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. A modular and adaptive hands-on workshop is described in detail. The workshop is based on multiplatform educational robotics content as a first step into the robotics world. Three educational tools are used to introduce examples of robotics applications. The operational details, materials, and examples of activities for selected modules are presented with the expectation that all teachers can adapt these activities to their classes. Despite the small number of students, the experience delivered results that might be useful for other instructors to promote workshops with similar or identical content to generate further benefits. This study demonstrates that it is important to combine theory and practice and include fun tasks that intertwine the challenges of applying theory to problem solving. Furthermore, the results show how the same content can be deployed using three different robotics education tools.","2174":"This paper discusses how emerging issues in housing construction could revolutionise the building industry.

Formal data are provided by official environmental institutes. Beyond those, however, there is a growing body of so-called informal sensing data, which are contributed by citizens using low-cost sensors. How good are these informal data, and how might they be applied, next to formal environmental sensing data? Could both types of sensing data be gainfully integrated? This paper presents the results of an online survey investigating perceptions within citizen science communities, environmental institutes and their networks of formal and informal environmental sensing data. The results show that citizens and experts had different views of formal and informal environmental sensing data, particularly on measurement frequency and the data information provision power. However, there was agreement, too, for example, on the accuracy of formal environmental sensing data. Furthermore, both agreed that the integration of formal and informal environmental sensing data offered potential for improvements on several aspects, particularly spatial coverage, data quantity and measurement frequency. Interestingly, the accuracy of informal environmental sensing data was largely unknown to both experts and citizens. This suggests the need for further investigation of informal environmental sensing data and the potential for its effective integration with formal environmental sensing data, if hurdles like standardisation can be overcome.

To enhance their accessibility, we here report the design, construction, validation, and benchmarking of an open-source microplate reader. The system features full-spectrum absorbance and fluorescence emission detection, in situ optogenetic stimulation, and stand-alone touch screen programming of automated assay protocols. The total system costs less than $3500, a fraction of the cost of commercial plate readers, and can detect the fluorescence of common dyes at concentrations as low as, similar to 10 nM. Functional capabilities were demonstrated in the context of synthetic biology, optogenetics, and photosensory biology: by steady-state measurements of ligand-induced reporter gene expression in a model of bacterial quorum sensing and by flavin photocycling kinetic measurements of a LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) domain photoreceptor used for optogenetic transcriptional activation.

Sensor timing using dedicated hardware is the de-facto method to achieve optimal sensor performance, but the solutions available today have limited flexibility and requires much effort when changing sensors. This article presents requirements and suggestions for a highly accurate, reconfigurable sensor timing system that simplifies integration of sensor systems and navigation systems for UAVs. Both typical avionics sensors, like GNSS receivers and IMUs, and more complex sensors, such as cameras, are supported. To verify the design, an implementation named the SenTiBoard was created, along with a software support package and a baseline sensor-suite. With the solution presented in this paper we get a measurement resolution of 10 nanoseconds and we can transfer up to 7.6 megabytes per second. If the sensor suite includes a GNSS receiver with a pulse-per-second (PPS) reference, the sensor measurements can be related to an absolute time reference (UTC) with a clock drift of 1.9 microseconds per second RMS. An experiment was carried out, using a Mini Cruiser fixed-wing UAV, where errors in georeferencing infrared images were reduced with a factor of 4 when compared to a software synchronization method.","2188":"The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus is on the \"design global, manufacture local\" model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a \"design global, manufacture local\" model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. \"Design global, manufacture local\" may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production.

Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework.

From a new sample of start-up firms making 3D printers, we show how their degree of openness for inbound and outbound knowledge flows relates to the firms' initial capabilities and founding intentions. From this, we suggest that the patterns of openness are influenced more by initial factor endowments than a firm-specific process of emergent strategy development.","Managerial SummaryInnovative firms often face trade-offs between open and proprietary strategies, particularly in industries and segments where online communities and other collaborations provide a pool of shared knowledge for the entire industry. This study illuminates these trade-offs by comparing the choices made by the founders of 3D printer manufacturers. For products based on modular systems, it shows the range of choices that firms have on their degree of inbound openness (using external technology) and outbound openness (sharing their own technology)as well as the interdependencies of these choices. Finally, it points to long-term implications of early entrepreneurial decisions: firms that leverage external technology can enter markets more quickly, but their innovation options will be limited unless they have capabilities for proprietary innovation."],"2197":"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers great potential for collecting air quality data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The objective of this study is to design and develop a modular UAV-based platform capable of real-time monitoring of multiple air pollutants. The system comprises five modules: the UAV, the ground station, the sensors, the data acquisition (DA) module, and the data fusion (DF) module. The hardware was constructed with off-the-shelf consumer parts and the open source software Ardupilot was used for flight control and data fusion. The prototype UAV system was tested in representative settings. Results show that this UAV platform can fly on pre-determined pathways with adequate flight time for various data collection missions. The system simultaneously collects air quality and high precision X-Y-Z data and integrates and visualizes them in a real-time manner. While the system can accommodate multiple gas sensors, UAV operations may electronically interfere with the performance of chemical-resistant sensors. Our prototype and experiments prove the feasibility of the system and show that it features a stable and high precision spatial-temporal platform for air sample collection. Future work should be focused on gas sensor development, plug-and-play interfaces, impacts of rotor wash, and all-weather designs.","2198":"Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.","2199":"This paper presents a system for remote monitoring of turbidity data that can detect light intensity and temperature using a microcontroller and the Internet of Things.

In this paper, we present our experience in conducting Arduino-based projects and how we used them to support the teaching of all the automatic control subjects in the course such as the mathematical modelling, the stability analysis, the controller design and the implementation of thePID controller. It was found that the new approach improves the attention and the overall performance of the students in the course which was reflected in the students' marks in the quizzes and exams.

In our study, we have taken four different pesticides viz., aldrin, tetradifon, glyphosate, and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture and have structural dissimilarities\/diversity. By using optical sensing techniques such as steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, we have analyzed the detailed exciton dynamics of QD in the presence of different pesticides. It has been found that the pesticide containing good leaving groups ( Cl) can interact with QD promptly and has high binding affinity (similar to 10(7) M-1). The different binding signatures of QD with different pesticides enable us to differentiate between the pesticides. Time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy provides significant variance (similar to 150-300 ns) for different pesticides. Furthermore, a large variation (10(5) Omega to 7 X 10(4) Omega) in the resistance of QD in the presence of different pesticides was revealed by electrochemical sensing technique. Moreover, during the interaction with pesticides, QD can also act as a photocatalyst to degrade pesticides. Present investigation explored the fact that the rate of degradation is positively affected by the binding affinity, i.e., the greater the binding, the greater is the degradation. What is more, both optical and electrochemical measurements of QD, in tandem, as described in our study could be utilized as the pattern recognition sensor for detection of several pesticides.","2211":["In many urban areas the population is exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. However, real-time air quality is usually only measured at few locations. These measurements provide a general picture of the state of the air, but they are unable to monitor local differences. New low-cost sensor technology is available for several years now, and has the potential to extend official monitoring networks significantly even though the current generation of sensors suffer from various technical issues.","Citizen science experiments based on these sensors must be designed carefully to avoid generation of data which is of poor or even useless quality. This study explores the added value of the 2016 Urban AirQ campaign, which focused on measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Sixteen low-cost air quality sensor devices were built and distributed among volunteers living close to roads with high traffic volume for a 2-month measurement period.","Each electrochemical sensor was calibrated in-field next to an air monitoring station during an 8-day period, resulting in R-2 ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. When temperature and relative humidity are included in a multilinear regression approach, the NO2 accuracy is improved significantly, with R-2 ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. Recalibration after the campaign is crucial, as all sensors show a significant signal drift in the 2-month measurement period. The measurement series between the calibration periods can be corrected for after the measurement period by taking a weighted average of the calibration coefficients.","Validation against an independent air monitoring station shows good agreement. Using our approach, the standard deviation of a typical sensor device for NO2 measurements was found to be 7 mu gm(-3), provided that temperatures are below 30 degrees C. Stronger ozone titration on street sides causes an underestimation of NO2 concentrations, which 75% of the time is less than 2.3 mu gm(-3).","Our findings show that citizen science campaigns using low-cost sensors based on the current generations of electro-chemical NO2 sensors may provide useful complementary data on local air quality in an urban setting, provided that experiments are properly set up and the data are carefully analysed."],"2215":"The ability of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle to navigate and fly precisely determines its utility and performance. The current navigation systems are highly dependent on the global positioning system and are prone to error because of global positioning system signal outages. However, advancements in onboard processing have enabled inertial navigation algorithms to perform well during short global positioning system outages. In this article, we propose an intelligent optical flow-based algorithm combined with Kalman filters to provide the navigation capability during global positioning system outages and global positioning system-denied environments. Traditional optical flow measurement uses block matching for motion vector calculation that makes the measurement task computationally expensive and slow. We propose the application of an artificial bee colony-based block matching technique for faster optical flow measurements. To effectively fuse optical flow data with inertial sensors output, we employ a modified form of extended Kalman filter. The modifications make the filter less noisy by utilizing the redundancy of sensors. We have achieved an accuracy of similar to 95% for all non-global positioning system navigation during our simulation studies. Our real-world experiments are in agreement with the simulation studies when effects of wind are taken into consideration.","2216":"Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated.

However, in practice, end-users do not have information about the energy consumption in real-time nor about the quality of the power they receive, because electric energy meters are too expensive and complex to be handled. In order to overcome these inconveniences, an innovative, open source, low-cost, precise, and reliable power and electric energy meter is presented that can be easily installed and managed by any inexperienced user at their own home in urban or rural areas.

Using a PhenoPipe module for calculation of multi-dimensional distances from phenotyping data, we observe a time after infection-dependent impact of U.maydis effector deletion strains on phenotypic response in maize. The PhenoBox\/PhenoPipe system is able to detect established salt stress responses in N.benthamiana.","We have developed an affordable, automated, open source imaging and data processing solution that can be adapted to various phenotyping applications in plant biology and beyond."],"2221":"Biometric systems designed on wearable technology have substantial differences from traditional biometric systems. Due to their wearable nature, they generally capture noisier signals and can only be trained with signals belonging to the device user (biometric verification). In this article, we assess the feasibility of using low-cost wearable sensors-photoplethysmogram (PPG), electrocardiogram (ECG), accelerometer (ACC), and galvanic skin response (GSR)-for biometric verification. We present a prototype, built with low-cost wearable sensors, that was used to capture data from 25 subjects while seated (at resting state), walking, and seated (after a gentle stroll). We used this data to evaluate how the different combinations of signals affected the biometric verification process. Our results showed that the low-cost sensors currently being embedded in many fitness bands and smart-watches can be combined to enable biometric verification. We report and compare the results obtained by all tested configurations. Our best configuration, which uses ECG, PPG and GSR, obtained 0.99 area under the curve and 0.02 equal error rate with only 60 s of training data. We have made our dataset public so that our work can be compared with proposals developed by other researchers.","2224":"We describe the development of a BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line-Of-Sight) model aircraft (UAV). The broad design requirements included (i) fuselage capable of accommodating an imaging package or other instrumentation, (ii) suitability for over-lake BVLOS authorization in Switzerland, (iii) capability of land or water take-offs\/landing, (iv) at least 90-min flight autonomy, (v) modularity of the imaging package and (vi) real-time IR\/RGB imagery. Requirement (i) was to ensure an aircraft amenable to future developments. Requirements (ii)-(iv) were driven by the goal of improving estimates of lake surface energy fluxes, since such fluxes have a major impact on long-term lake temperatures and hence ecological status. Requirement (v), in conjunction with (i), allows the UAV to be adapted to other imaging applications. The real-time imagery requirement (vi) permits modifications of on-going missions to map areas of specific interest as they are detected. The prototype UAV produced to satisfy these characteristics was built on the twin-motor My Twin Dream (MTD) aircraft, which has a 1.8-m wing span airframe and a spacious fuselage. The legal authorization necessitated, where feasible, hardware redundancy as well as installation of a parachute system. Continuous communication between the ground station and UAV is provided by the LTE cellular telephone network. The UAV communication is handled by an on-board Linux computer, which is also responsible for control of the imagery package. The avionics involved modifications of the open-source APM autopilot software and the associated ground control station. A key modification was to support a custom-built emergency recovery system, which is triggered by loss of a heart-beat signal from the autopilot. The MTD airframe was modified to accommodate the system electronics and imaging hardware. Results from test flights over Lake Geneva demonstrate the ability of the aircraft to produce imagery data.","2225":"Agricultural research involves study of the complex soil-plant-atmosphere-water system, and data relating to this system must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.","2226":"Cross-correlation of independent, equipartitioned wavefields is a well-established method to estimate the elastic Green's function, commonly termed seismic interferometry. In this article, the sum of a wavefield recorded at two locations in a single channel is used to estimate the Green's function via the autocorrelation; the result contains some predicted artefacts. The underlying theory and hardware required to estimate the Green's function is presented and compared to traditional seismic interferometry. This technique is used to estimate the elastic Green's function between two locations on an aluminum block with surface scatterers. Wavefields excited via rapid thermoelastic expansion of the surface using a pulsed laser are detected by a dual-beam heterodyne interferometer. The detector is capable of directly recording the sum of a wavefield measured at two locations in a single channel. This method could be an effective, low cost, and non-contacting technique for structural monitoring, particularly where ambient noise has established equipartitioned wavefields in the structure.

Those systems use the flexibility of the Internet of Things to operate the video camera only when an intrusion is detected. We are the only ones that focus on the design of protocols based on intelligent agents to communicate the video of an intrusion in real time to the guards by wireless or mobile networks. The goal is to communicate, in real time, the video to the guards who can be moving towards the smart home. However, this communication suffers from sporadic disruptions that difficults the control and drastically reduces user satisfaction and operativity of the system. In a novel way, we have designed a generic software architecture based on design patterns that can be adapted to any hardware in a simple way. The implanted hardware is of very low economic cost; the software frameworks are free. In the experimental tests we have shown that it is possible to communicate to the moving guard, intrusion notifications (by e-mail and by instant messaging), and the first video frames in less than 20 s. In addition, we automatically recovered the frames of video lost in the disruptions in a transparent way to the user, we supported vertical handover processes and we could save energy of the smartphone's battery. However, the most important thing was that the high satisfaction of the people who have used the system.","2229":"Arts, Real-Time Video and Interactivity for Sustainability (ARTiVIS) is an ongoing collaborative research project investigating how real-time video, DIY surveillance technologies and sensor data can be used as a tool for environmental awareness, activism and artistic explorations. The project consists of a series of digital contexts for aesthetic contemplation of nature and civic engagement, aiming to foster awareness and empowerment of local populations through DIY surveillance. At the core of the ARTIVIS efforts are a series of interactive installations (namely B-Wind!, Hug@tree and Play with Fire), that make use of surveillance technologies and real-time video as raw material to promote environmental awareness through the emotion generated by real-time connections with nature. Throughout the project development, the surveillance concept has been shifting from the use of surveillance technology in a centralized platform, to the idea of veillance with distributed peer-to-peer networks that can be used for science and environmental monitoring. In this paper we present the history of the ARTiVIS project, related and inspiring work, describe ongoing research work and explore the present and future challenges of appropriating surveillance technology for artistic, educational and civic engagement purposes.","2231":"The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4e amendment aims to improve reliability and energy efficiency in industrial and other challenging Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments. This paper presents an accurate and up-to-date energy consumption model for devices using this IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode. The model identifies all network-related CPU and radio state changes, thus providing a precise representation of the device behavior and an accurate prediction of its energy consumption. Moreover, energy measurements were performed with a dual-band OpenMote device, running the OpenWSN firmware. This allows the model to be used for devices using 2.4 GHz, as well as 868 MHz. Using these measurements, several network simulations were conducted to observe the TSCH energy consumption effects in end-to-end communication for both frequency bands. Experimental verification of the model shows that it accurately models the consumption for all possible packet sizes and that the calculated consumption on average differs less than 3% from the measured consumption. This deviation includes measurement inaccuracies and the variations of the guard time. As such, the proposed model is very suitable for accurate energy consumption modeling of TSCH networks.","2232":"3D printing content, which has been increasingly shared through the open communities over the last decade, has both aesthetic and functional features. There has been growing concern over whether current licensing policies provide sufficient options for contributors to the open communities. To suggest a direction for alternative license options, it is necessary to understand contributors' license preferences for sharing diverse 3D printing content. Using a logit model based on information collected from Thingiverse, this study investigates the relationship between the various features of 3D printing content and contributors' choices among the Creative Commons licenses currently available. The result indicates that preferences are clearly distinguished by the features of the content, whether the content is functional or non-functional in nature. However, there is no significant difference, in terms of license choice, for the numerous 3D printing content items that contain both functional and non-functional features. This result implies that there is a deficiency in the current licenses that cover 3D printing content. Implications for future license policies are discussed.","2233":null,"2236":"Testbeds are powerful large-scale experimentation tools. Often, however, their limited scope and\/ or unrealistic functionality result in anecdotal use.

However, we identify that while this platformization is happening in the cloud elements of the value chain, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are still designed in an application-specific manner, thus limiting pilots initiatives.","2237":"With the recent advancement in wearable computing, sensor technologies, and data processing approaches, it is possible to develop smart clothing that integrates sensors into garments. The main objective of this study was to develop the method of automatic recognition of sedentary behavior related to cardiovascular risk based on quantitative measurement of physical activity. The solution is based on the designed prototype of the smart shirt equipped with a processor, wearable sensors, power supply and telemedical interface. The data derived from wearable sensors were used to create feature vector that consisted of the estimation of the user-specific relative intensity and the variance of filtered accelerometer data. The method was validated using an experimental protocol which was designed to be safe for the elderly and was based on clinically validated short physical performance battery (SPPB) test tasks. To obtain the recognition model six classifiers were examined and compared including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Binary Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks. The classification models were able to identify the sedentary behavior with an accuracy of 95.00% +\/- 2.11%. Experimental results suggested that high accuracy can be obtained by estimating sedentary behavior pattern using the smart shirt and machine learning approach.

However, there is a lack of hardware and software support to effectively develop the potential of UASs in different remote sensing applications, such as the detection of radioactive sources. This paper presents the design, development and validation of a UAS for the detection of an uncontrolled and point radioactive source. The article describes a flexible and reusable software architecture for detecting the radioactive source (NaTcO4, containing Tc-99m) with a gamma-ray Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) spectrometer as a proof of concept. The UAS is equipped with multichannel air-ground communications to perform missions beyond line of sight and onboard computation to process samples in real time and thus react to any anomaly detected during the mission. An ad hoc ground control station (GCS) has also been developed for the correct interpretation of the radioactive samples taken by the UAS. Radiological spectra plots, contour mapping and waterfall plots are some of the elements used in the ad hoc GCS. The article shows the results obtained in a flight campaign performing different flights at different altitudes and speeds over the radiological source, demonstrating the viability of the system.","2243":"This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an \"operational pragmatics.\" Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how \"operational pragmatics\" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.","2244":["Study Design: A male patient with partial hand amputation of his nondominant hand, with only stumps of the proximal phalanx of the first and fifth finger, was evaluated.

This study focuses on a specific LPWAN technology, namely Long Range Wireless Area Network (LoRaWAN), which is being widely investigated by the research community worldwide. LoRaWAN offers many noticeable features, including wide coverage areas, security by design, power consumption and bandwidth optimisation, and a high degree of flexibility and reconfigurability.

Considering the breadth of this topic, we will describe each different branch of these technologies with the example of case studies based on work of the Italian company Arc-Team. Our overview begins with 3D visualization for scientific purposes, showing a project funded by the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol (Italy) in order to improve knowledge about WWI. Second, we analyze a similar project, funded by the Autonomous Province of Trentino (Italy), but with the aim to increase tourism at a high alpine WWI site. The third example is the development of another prototype for tourism: a 3D web-map for the cultural valorization of the historical border (1753) between the region Tyrol and the Most Serene Republic of Venice. In the forth case study, we discuss the implementation of 3D within web platforms for archaeological project management of RAPTOR (Ricerca Archivi e Pratiche per la Tutela Operativa Regionale), a webGIS developed to aid in preservation and conservation efforts of cultural heritage for the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (MiBACT). Fifth, we explore recent uses of 3D models for web-coworking during the process of excavation management, thanks to the developments of real-time 3D acquisition techniques based on SLAM algorithms and archeorobotic devices. Finally, 3D web-coworking is also analyzed illustrating some simple web tools that afford rapid feedback in data visualization, considering not only excavation field-work but also exploration projects. This overview, based on six different case studies, represents the four fields in which 3D web technologies are currently used in commercial archaeology: scientific communication; tourism improvement; preservation of cultural heritage; and real time field-work management.

These diagnostics monitor the fabrication of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which detect and flag any non-uniformity that may potentially harm PEMFC performance and\/or lifetime. This will require quantitative thresholds and a clear distinction between harmful defects and harmless coating irregularities. Thus, novel fuel cell hardware with quasi in-situ infrared (IR) thermography capabilities is utilized to understand how bare spots in the cathode electrode impact MEA lifetime. An accelerated stress test (AST) simulates chemical and mechanical degradation modes seen in vehicular operation. The actual open circuit voltage and rate of change of this voltage are used as in-situ indicators for MEA failure, enabling capture of the progression of failure point development. Bare spot coating irregularities located at the center of the electrode were found to have no impact on MEA lifetime when compared to a pristine MEA. However, MEA lifetime was found to be considerably shortened when these same irregularities are located at the cathode inlet and, especially, the anode inlet regions of the fuel cell.

In order to encourage IoT application and assure an appropriate selection of processes to be improved by IoT technology, a group of analysis criteria must be highlighted to give the companies a tool to perform the correct selection. This study aims to propose a model for selecting IoT technology. The research design combines a systematic literature review, applying bibliometrics and content analysis, with case application and refinement. An application was carried out in an IoT hardware company, incorporating it at a solvent recycling machine. A second application was performed in a seedling selection machine producer. As a result, a model for selecting IoT technology is presented, which consists of four phasesprocess modeling, grading, weighting, and final selection. The model applies an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on the following criteria: reliability, security, business, mobility, and heterogeneity. The results also suggest IoT selection is related to the ability of combining different criteria related to the system and technology selection to install IoT solutions. Finally, issues related to the system characteristics other than technology are becoming more cited in the literature in the last 5years concluding that selecting IoT technology is a complex activity that needs to be improved, especially in the years to come.","2258":"We propose a new application of inexpensive light-emitting diode (LED)-based Sun photometers, consisting of measuring the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with high resolution within metropolitan scales. Previously, these instruments have been used at continental scales by the GLOBE program, but this extension is already covered by more expensive and higher-precision instruments of the AERONET global network. For this we built an open source two-channeled LED-based Sun photometer based on previous developments, with improvements in the hardware, software, and modifications on the calibration procedure. Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564nm and 0.009 at the 408nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others.","2260":"In the Cultural Heritage domain, novel fruition and enjoyment approaches, based on Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, have the effect to change the way people expenencing cultural spaces, such as museums and exhibitions.

To overcome these barriers, this study provides open source (OS) designs for a low-cost circuit milling machine. First, design modifications for mechanical and electrical subsystems of the OS Distributed 3-D (D3D) Robotics prototyping system are provided. Next, Copper Carve, an OS custom graphical user interface, is developed to enable circuit board milling by implementing backlash and substrate distortion compensation. The performance of the OS D3D circuit mill is then quantified and validated for: positional accuracy, cut quality, feature accuracy, and distortion compensation. Finally, the return on investment is calculated for inventors using it. The results show by properly compensating for motion inaccuracies with Copper Carve, the machine achieves a motion resolution of 10 microns, which is more than adequate for most circuit designs. The mill is at least five times less expensive than all commercial alternatives and the material costs of the D3D mill are repaid from fabricating 20-43 boards.

In addition, affordable fused filament fabrication (FFF)-based 3-D printing has successfully produced high-quality and affordable scientific equipment, focusing on tools without strict chemical compatibility limitations. As the additives and colorants used in 3-D printing filaments are proprietary, their compatibility with common chemicals is unknown, which has prevented their widespread use in laboratory chemical processing. In this study, the compatibility of ten widely available FFF plastics with solvents, acids, bases and solutions used in the wet processing of semiconductor materials is explored. The results provide data on materials unavailable in the literature and the chemical properties of 3-D printable plastics that were, are in line with literature. Overall, many 3-D printable plastics are compatible with concentrated solutions. Polypropylene emerged as a promising 3-D printable material for semiconductor processing due to its tolerance of strongly oxidizing acids, such as nitric and sulfuric acids. In addition, 3-D printed custom tools were demonstrated for a range of wet processing applications.

One reason of these policies is the bad energy consumption efficiency of current air-conditioning systems that cool or warm indirectly human body. Several researches have been investigating the effect of direct human body cooling and warming. However, most proposed solutions focus on direct head or neck cooling, using ice to cool a water circulating system, such temperature during use cannot be controlled accurately nor adapted to user and environment conditions. Recently, a Japanese research team developed a portable system using Peltier elements that can both cool and warm neck. Though cooling was demonstrated to affect positively both physiological and psychological state in summer heat environment, in cold climate it could be confirmed for only neck warming but not feet and hands. In our objective of developing effective energy saving technology for direct temperature-conditioning of human body, and in order to reduce the discomfort caused by body chillness, we have proposed and developed a Peltier element based wrist-mounted wearable device that directly warms human body.

These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.","2275":"This study presents an entirely open-source, low-cost power monitoring system capable of many types of measurements including both loads and supplies such as solar photovoltaic systems.

Using accessible equipment, the DUEL node can be calibrated to a desirable accuracy and error. The DUEL nodes are also completely customizable, making them fit for any input range, where all commercially-available products are fixed range.

The proposed ArUco mapping algorithm can build and correct the map of markers online with Grubbs criterion and K-mean clustering, which avoids the map distortion due to lack of correction. Based on the conception of multi-sensor information fusion, the federated Kalman filter is utilized to synthesize the multi-source information from markers, optical flow, ultrasonic and the inertial sensor, which can obtain a continuous localization result and effectively reduce the position drift due to the long-term loss of markers in pure marker localization. The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented in a hardware of one Raspberry Pi Zero and two STM32 micro controllers produced by STMicroelectronics (Geneva, Switzerland). Thus, a small-size and low-cost marker-based localization system is presented. The experimental results show that the speed estimation result of the proposed system is better than Px4flow, and it has the centimeter accuracy of mapping and positioning. The presented system not only gives satisfying localization precision, but also has the potential to expand other sensors (such as visual odometry, ultra wideband (UWB) beacon and lidar) to further improve the localization performance.

Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.","2285":"In sensory evaluation, there have been many attempts to obtain responses from the autonomic nervous system (ANS) by analyzing heart rate, body temperature, and facial expressions. However, the methods involved tend to be intrusive, which interfere with the consumers' responses as they are more aware of the measurements. Furthermore, the existing methods to measure different ANS responses are not synchronized among them as they are measured independently. This paper discusses the development of an integrated camera system paired with an Android PC application to assess sensory evaluation and biometric responses simultaneously in the Cloud, such as heart rate, blood pressure, facial expressions, and skin-temperature changes using video and thermal images acquired by the integrated system and analyzed through computer vision algorithms written in Matlab (R), and FaceReader (TM). All results can be analyzed through customized codes for multivariate data analysis, based on principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Data collected can be also used for machine-learning modeling based on biometrics as inputs and self-reported data as targets. Based on previous studies using this integrated camera and analysis system, it has shown to be a reliable, accurate, and convenient technique to complement the traditional sensory analysis of both food and nonfood products to obtain more information from consumers and\/or trained panelists.","2287":"About a decade ago, people concerned about the risks of adopting cloud computing. It was an unproven new thing that raised more questions than it answered. Nowadays, we hear more about the risks of not adopting the cloud. Three of the leading cloud players, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, and other participants have developed complex cloud platforms that are driving the cloud agenda and launching innovative new products to meet the needs of modern businesses. When looking at processors, core components of the cloud, there is a trend for hyperscale data centers is to move beyond the CPUs and turn to dedicated chips, such as graphics processing units, field programmable gating arrays, and application specific integrated circuits. We think it is an artificial intelligence (AI) realization process and provide a detailed survey about hardware server design in this process. After discussing and summarizing various disclosed techniques and platforms, we conceived a hybrid hardware structure for efficient AI applications.","2293":"With the continued establishment of hacker-spaces and fab-labs hosted in academic libraries, there is an increase in the availability of resources for designing scientific instrumentation in the undergraduate curriculum. Many available designs, however, may be too complex to fabricate in teaching environments. Presented here is OMIS, the Open Millifluidic Inquiry System, which is a platform for performing small-scale chemical synthesis and analysis. OMIS consists of a 3D printed syringe pump, control hardware based upon the Arduino microcontroller and 3D printed reaction vessels. The OMIS syringe pump utilizes a low-power stepper motor which simplifies the instrument construction and allows for power to be supplied from batteries or the USB port of a computer. The simple design of OMIS allows for the instrument to be fabricated in one day, including the time to 3D print components. The OMIS syringe pump is able to deliver fluids at rates between 60 and 300 mu L\/min, depending on syringe size, with a reproducibility of 3%. Several applications of OMIS are presented, including a demonstration of laminar flow in a 3D printed millifluidic chip, implementation of a low-volume flow-cell cuvette insert and the synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles.

A crucial aspect is the ability to search for the boundaries of the wildfire by exploring a wide area. However, even as wildfires are increasing today, the number of available monitoring systems that can provide support is decreasing, creating an operational gap and slow response in such urgent situations. The objective of this work is to estimate a propagating boundary and create an autonomous system that works in real time. It proposes a coordination strategy with a new methodology for estimating the periphery of a propagating phenomenon using limited observations. The complete system design, tested on the high-fidelity simulation, demonstrates that steering the vehicles toward the highest perpendicular uncertainty generates the effective predictions. The results indicate that the new coordination scheme has a large beneficial impact on uncertainty suppression. This study thus suggests that an efficient solution for suppressing uncertainty in monitoring a wildfire is to use a fleet of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles that can be deployed quickly. Further research is needed on other deployment schemes that work in different natural disaster case studies.","2296":"As the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution presents an enormous opportunity for all industry verticals ranging from startups to large enterprises to create new types of services, standard bodies and global alliances have been working on establishing common standards for IoT systems. The oneM2M is the global partnership developing standards for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications and the Internet of Things. It develops technical specifications for the globally-applicable, interoperable common M2M\/IoT service layer platforms, which play a pivotal role in building the ecosystem driven by key players, including developers and consumers. In this paper, we analyze the oneM2M standards, and introduce Mobius and &Cube, which are oneM2M-compliant M2M\/IoT software platforms for servers and devices, respectively. We also present four pilot services using the platforms and several prototype IoT devices. Finally, we discuss three aspects, advanced discovery, open API, and peer-to-peer that are required for the oneM2M to build IoT ecosystem by attracting developers and consumers into the emerging IoT ecosystem.","2300":"Although air pollution is one of the most significant environmental factors posing a threat to human health worldwide, air quality data are scarce or not easily accessible in most European countries. The current work aims to develop a centralized air quality data hub that enables citizens to contribute to air quality monitoring. In this work, data from official air quality monitoring stations are combined with air pollution estimates from sky-depicting photos and from low-cost sensing devices that citizens build on their own so that citizens receive improved information about the quality of the air they breathe. Additionally, a data fusion algorithm merges air quality information from various sources to provide information in areas where no air quality measurements exist.","2302":"In this paper, a structured methodology is proposed to define the architecture for a communication framework with multiframe capability, which can be embedded in a residential smart meter hardware for smart grid applications. This framework is based on the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet protocol, and it is considered that the data are exchanged via wireless technologies. The architectural model was based upon the state-of-the-art in software engineering, making use of the design patterns and the principles of low coupling and high cohesion, which result in a solution that is both more reliable and maintainable. A security module is also provided and the framework performance is evaluated, in terms of packet throughput and computational effort of the security layer on the processing device, via practical experiments of some laboratory scenarios. Furthermore, errors on some frames are introduced in order to evaluate the feasibility of this framework in real field applications. Results show that this framework architecture supports acceptable transfer rates even with extra computational cost due to the use of data encryption and separated processing modules, making it a feasible proposal for the considered application context.","2303":"India's Public Distribution System (PDS) comprises ration shops which are responsible for distribution of ration to many poor families. Necessary commodities such as rice, kerosene, sugar, wheat etc., are supplied to the less privileged sections as per the eligibility and at fixed rates by the Indian government. However, the existing system suffers from major drawbacks such as storage of food grains, manual and inconsistent tallying of records against stock, black marketing and housekeeping. Hence, the conventional system needs some modification to ensure there is minimal wastage and food grains reach the right people. The major contribution of the hardware lies in acquiring records from the warehouses located in far off places to a centralized server managed by the administrator. This system also solves the problem of black marketing with the use of Aadhar cards and biometric scanning which are used for the verification of the consumer at the time of purchase. In addition to the above, another aspect of the system is the management of two types of databases, one of them is used for storing the data of the consumer and the other for maintaining the record of the availability of the ration in various warehouses which are located in different parts of the country.

In this paper, findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6) on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control mechanisms.

A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a humanitarian context.","2306":"Without requiring targets to carry any device, device-free-based tracking is playing an important role in many emerging applications such as smart homes, fitness tracking, intruder detection, etc. While promising, current device-free tracking systems based on inexpensive commercial devices perform well in the training environment, but poorly in other environments because of different multipath reflections. This paper introduces RDTrack, a system that leverages changes in Doppler shifts, which are not sensitive to multipath, to accurately track the target. Moreover, RDTrack identifies particular patterns for fine-grained motions such as turning, walking straightly, etc., which can achieve accurate tracking. For the purpose of achieving a fine-grained device-free tracking system, this paper builds a trajectory estimating model using HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to improve the matching accuracy and reduce the time complexity. We address several challenges including estimating the tag influenced time period, identifying moving path and reducing false positives due to multipath. We implement RDTrack with inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) hardware and extensively evaluate RDTrack in a lobby, staircase and library. Our results show that RDTrack is effective in tracking the moving target, with a low tracking error of 32 cm. This accuracy is robust for different environments, highlighting RDTrack's ability to enable future essential device-free moving-based interaction with RFID devices.","2307":"Low-cost MEMS accelerometers have the potential to be used in a number of tilt-based monitoring applications but have the disadvantage of being very sensitive to temperature variation (thermal drift). In this paper, we analyze the thermal behavior of a low-cost sensor in the range -10 to +45 degrees C in order to provide a simple compensation strategy to mitigate this problem. For sensor analysis, we have developed a miniaturized thermal chamber, which was mounted on a tilting device to account for tilt angle variation. The obtained raw data were used to construct low degree polynomial equations that by relating the measurement error induced by thermal drift (i.e., acceleration residuals) to temperature and inclination (of each specific axis), can be used for thermal compensation. To validate our compensation strategy, we performed a field monitoring test and evaluated the compensation performance by calculating RMS errors before and after correction. After compensation, the RMS errors calculated for both the X and Y axes decreased by 96%, indicating the potential of using a simple set of equations to solve common drawbacks that currently make low-cost MEMS sensors unsuitable for tilt-based monitoring applications.","2310":"Objective. A major goal in systems neuroscience is to determine the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior. 'lb this end, methods that combine monitoring neural activity, behavioral tracking, and targeted manipulation of neurons in closed-loop are powerful tools. However, commercial systems that allow these types of experiments are usually expensive and rely on non-standardized data formats and proprietary software which may hinder user-modifications for specific needs. In order to promote reproducibility and data-sharing in science, transparent software and standardized data formats are an advantage. Here, we present an open source, low-cost, adaptable, and easy to set-up system for combined behavioral tracking, electrophysiology, and closed-loop stimulation. Approach. Based on the Open Ephys system (www.open-ephys.org ) we developed multiple modules to include realtime tracking and behavior-based closed-loop stimulation. We describe the equipment and provide a step-by-step guide to set up the system. Combining the open source software Bonsai (bonsai-rx.org ) for analyzing camera images in real time with the newly developed modules in Open Ephys, we acquire position information, visualize tracking, and perform tracking-based closed-loop stimulation experiments. To analyze the acquired data we provide an open source file reading package in Python. Main results. The system robustly visualizes real-time tracking and reliably recovers tracking information recorded from a range of sampling frequencies (30-1000 Hz). We combined electrophysiology with the newly-developed tracking modules in Open Ephys to record place cell and grid cell activity in the hippocampus and in the medial entorhinal cortex, respectively. Moreover, we present a case in which we used the system for closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal grid cells. Significance. Expanding the Open Ephys system to include animal tracking and behavior-based closed-loop stimulation extends the availability of high-quality, low-cost experimental setup within standardized data formats serving the neuroscience community.","2311":"We report the design and implementation of an affordable bedside device, Neo is capable of acquiring vital data in real time by integrating with diverse devices connected to newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). NICUs are equipped with multiple vital sign monitoring devices that are connected to the premature newborn and acquire a few gigabytes of data every day. The continuous vital data from these devices are manually documented every hour. This introduces errors and loses a large amount of high-resolution data. The intermittent documentation of physiological data also makes it difficult for clinicians to visualize and detect the trends of diagnostic utility. Neo is built on an affordable Internet of Things platform that aggregates and sends the real-time data to a cloud-based big data platform called integrated NICU. Apart from minimizing documentation errors, the device enables data acquisition at sufficiently real-time rates as to indicate the current status of all the patients at the NICU. Neo automates immediate vital sign status and past trends as graphs or charts that the doctor and nurses can view from anywhere through the Internet. Physiological signal and clinical parameters from Neo is used to score different diseases like sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity. This score predicts the physiological health of the newborn and aid clinicians in decision-making ensuring timely intervention.","2312":"Water quality assessment programs for the management of water resources require the collection of water samples for physical, chemical, and biological analyses. Lack of personnel, accessibility of water bodies, and time constraints, especially after natural disasters and emergencies, are some of the challenges of water sampling. To overcome these challenges, a custom-made thief-style water sampling mechanism was developed and mounted on a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for autonomous water sampling. The payload capacity and endurance of the UAV were determined using an indoor test station. The UAV was equipped with floatation, and electronic components were coated to prevent water damage in the event of a forced landing or for sample collection. Water samples from a 1.1 ha pond were collected with the developed UAV-assisted water sampling system and traditional manual methods. Dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature and chloride measurements were made on samples collected with both UAV-assisted and manual methods and compared. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature were minimal except for chloride level. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature measurements were 3.6%, 2.3%, 0.76%, and 0.03%, respectively. Measured chloride levels for the manual and UAV-assisted sampling methods were 3.97 and 5.46 mg\/L. UAV-assisted water sampling may prove faster and safer than manual water sampling from large surface waters and from difficult to access water bodies.","2315":"Accounts of the copyright industries in national reports suggest that strong intellectual property (IP) rights support creative firms. However, mounting evidence from sectors such as video game production and 3-D printing indicate that business models based on open IP can also be profitable. This study investigates the relationship between IP protection and value capture for creative industry firms engaged in collective\/open innovation activities. A sample of 22 businesses interviewed in this study did not require exclusive ownership of creative materials but instead employed a range of strategies to compete and capture value. Benefits for some firms resemble those for participants in private-collective innovation (PCI), originally observed in open-source software development. Advantages of PCI include the ability to commercialize user improvements and a reduction in transaction costs related to seeking and obtaining permission to innovate existing ideas. Some creative firms in this study were able to generate and capture value from PCI in two directions: upstream and downstream. These dynamics offer a mechanism to understand and articulate the value of openness for creative industries policy and management of creative organizations.

This integration is developed by encompassing the use of sensors, microcontrollers, civil engineering problems, app development, and fabrication. The proposal provides an explorative way of approaching the numerous possibilities that arise in civil engineering when it comes to IoT, automation, monitoring, and control of civil engineering processes. The used tools represent accessible and affordable ways for application in classrooms and in educational laboratories for beginners. The initial explorative approach implies the fusion of three realms: (i) the phenomenology and mathematics of varied civil engineering problems; (ii) the systematic use of digital fabrication technologies and electronic prototyping platforms; and (iii) the creative and visual way of developing codes provided by block-based development platforms. This integration of perspectives is an attempt of approaching civil engineering mathematics to technology and arts with a rigorous scientific approach. A set of different examples is presented with the corresponding findings in educational terms. These examples are developed in a constructive, scaffolding-based way and may contribute as a potential alternative in the development of open-source teaching labs in civil engineering schools.","2318":"Optogenetics is a technology wherein researchers combine light and genetically engineered photoreceptors to control biological processes with unrivaled precision. Near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (>700 nm) are desirable optogenetic inputs due to their low phototoxicity and spectral isolation from most photoproteins. The bacteriophytochrome photoreceptor 1 (BphP1), found in several purple photosynthetic bacteria, senses NIR light and activates transcription of photosystem promoters by binding to and inhibiting the transcriptional repressor PpsR2. Here, we examine the response of a library of output promoters to increasing levels of Rhodopseudomonas palustris PpsR2 expression, and we identify that of Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 crtE as the most strongly repressed in Escherichia coli. Next, we optimize Rps. palustris bphP1 and ppsR2 expression in a strain engineered to produce the required chromophore biliverdin IX alpha in order to demonstrate NIR-activated transcription. Unlike a previously engineered bacterial NIR photoreceptor, our system does not require production of a second messenger, and it exhibits rapid response dynamics. It is also the most red-shifted bacterial optogenetic tool yet reported by approximately SO nm. Accordingly, our BphP1-PpsR2 system has numerous applications in bacterial optogenetics.","2320":"The Arctic region is known to be severely affected by climate change, with evident alterations in both physical and biological processes. Monitoring the Arctic Ocean ecosystem is key to understanding the impact of natural and human-induced change on the environment. Large data sets are required to monitor the Arctic marine ecosystem and validate high-resolution satellite observations (e.g., Sentinel), which are necessary to feed climatic and biogeochemical forecasting models. However, the Global Observing System needs to complete its geographic coverage, particularly for the harsh, extreme environment of the Arctic Region. In this scenario, autonomous systems are proving to be valuable tools for increasing the resolution of existing data. To this end, a low-cost, miniaturized and flexible probe, ArLoC (Arctic Low-Cost probe), was designed, built and installed on an innovative unmanned marine vehicle, the PROTEUS (Portable RObotic TEchnology for Unmanned Surveys), during a preliminary scientific campaign in the Svalbard Archipelago within the UVASS project.

This paper provides contactless coalescence and mixing techniques for droplets in air by controlling the acoustic potential by using an ultrasonic phased array. We focused on mode oscillation to propose an efficient mixing technique for liquid without contact. A comparison of mixing performance between cases with mode oscillation and without mode oscillation showed that the flow induced by mode oscillation promotes droplet mixing. Our paper demonstrates the feasibility of contactless coalescence and mixing as a first step in fluid manipulation with a phased array.","2322":"In this study, we present a class of nonlinear analytical solutions for the dynamics of a fixed wing unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV). These solutions are needed for the integration and fusion of sensor data for input to guidance and control algorithms. Derivation and integration of the 3-rd order vector differential equation of motion, and its applications to various dynamical models are presented. It is assumed that (a) acceleration due to aerodynamic lift, and the difference between the propulsive thrust and aerodynamic drag accelerations are not changed; (b) the bank angle is zero; (c) the sideslip angle is zero. The general integral and the corresponding analytical solutions for a class of flight trajectories consist of six independent integrals for heading angle, magnitude of velocity vector, time, altitude, and two components of the position vector. This explicit expression with respect to the governing parameters facilitates its direct incorporation into the development and design of trajectories, targeting, guidance and control schemes. It is shown that the first integrals which have been shown valid for a variety of aircraft platforms, re-entry vehicles and missiles, can specifically be applied to UAVs in which such control solutions are needed for sense and avoid situations. An illustrative example highlights the applicability of the general integral for range of trajectories and conditions pertinent to UAV flight patterns.","2323":"The low-cost Open qPCR instrument can be used for different tasks in the aptamer selection process: quantification of DNA, cycle course optimization, screening, and final binding characterization. We have selected aptamers against whole Drosophila C virus (DCV) particles and recombinant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We performed systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) using the Open qPCR to optimize each amplification step. The Open qPCR instrument identified the best aptamer candidate. The Open qPCR has the capacity to perform melt curves, and we used this function to perform thermofluorimetric analysis (TFA) to quantify target-aptamer binding. We confirmed target-aptamer binding using flow cytometry. A sandwich type luminescence bioassay based on our anti-DCV aptamer was sensitive to DCV and did not respond to a related virus, demonstrating that our selected anti-DCV aptamer can be used to specifically detect DCV.","2324":"This paper develops a novel energy universal service bus system (EUSBS) based on emerging energy Internet (E-net) technologies.

First, the functions design, overall framework and topology architecture design of the EUSBS are expounded, among which the EUSBS is mainly composed of a hardware system and a software platform. Moreover, several future application scenarios are presented. Then, the hardware part of EUSBS is designed and developed, including the framework design of this hardware subsystem, and development of the hardware equipment for PV access, fans access, EVCS access, ESE access, and CRU access. The hardware subsystem consists of smart socket, and household\/floor\/building concentrators. Based on this, the prototypes development of EUSBS hardware equipment is completely demonstrated. Third, the software part of the EUSBS is developed as a cloud service platform for electricity use data analysis of DEE. This software subsystem contains the power quality & energy efficiency analysis module, optimization control module, information and service module, and data monitoring and electricity behavior analysis module. Based on this design, the software interfaces are developed. Finally, an application study on energy management and optimization of a smart commercial building is conducted to evaluate the functions and practicality of this EUSBS. The EUSBS developed in this paper is able to overcome difficulties in big data collection and utilization on sides of distribution network and electricity utilization, and eventually implement a deep information-energy fusion and a friendly supply-demand interaction between the grid and users. This contribution presents a detailed and systematic development scheme of the EUSBS, and moreover, the laboratory prototypes of the hardware and software subsystems have been developed based on E-net technologies.

In order to achieve this reduction of society's throughput, radical changes in the ways goods and services are produced, distributed and used are required. In this think piece, concepts of consumer integration into the value creation process and (new) enabling technologies are discussed as possible constituting elements of alternative organizational models in a degrowth society. To date, collaborative value creation concepts, such as crowdsourcing and mass customization, have been discussed almost exclusively as business model patterns for companies in economies that are set to grow. The same applies to the assessment of (new) technologies, such as additive manufacturing, web-based user interfaces for co-creation, and other flexible production technologies that allow for collaborative and individualized production. Potential positive and negative effects of these concepts and technologies with regard to the objectives of degrowth are discussed in order to initiate a debate about the inclusion of CVC for the design of alternative organizational models that are in line with degrowth thinking. This think piece illustrates that several elements of collaborative value creation and its enabling technologies coincide with degrowth objectives but do not lead per se to their attainment. Thereby, a starting point for future (empirical) work in this area is generated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare a strengthened validation approach for neural networks based on classification techniques with a novel proposal one, based on clustering strategies. Such approaches allow us to identify natural users' groups in data and to verify the model responses in terms of user interests. Finally, the presented model has been extended to simulate social behaviours in a community, through the sharing of interests and opinions related to cultural heritage assets. This data propagation has been further analysed in order to reproduce applicative scenarios on social networks.","2331":["Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopic elbow release for both traumatic and degenerative contractures from intraoperative recording through the recovery time until final follow-up.","Methods: The study is based on 54 consecutive patients with extrinsic elbow contracture (traumatic in 31 and degenerative in 23) treated with arthroscopic arthrolysis by a single surgeon in 2011-2015. Range of motion (ROM) and the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) were recorded preoperatively; intraoperatively; following release; and in the 1st, 3rd, 8th. 12th, and 26th weeks and at 2 years postoperatively.","Results: Significant improvements were noted in extension, flexion, and range of motion, measured both intraoperatively and at all follow-up visits. The greatest improvement in the range of motion was achieved at the time of surgery (from 89 degrees +\/- 28 degrees to 131 degrees +\/- 14 degrees. P < .001); it then decreased at 1 week to 103 degrees +\/- 22 degrees (P < .001) and slowly recovered to reach 124 degrees +\/- 22 degrees after 2 years. This was better than the preoperative value (P < .001) but worse than the intraoperative value (P = .002). A similar pattern was observed in both traumatic and degenerative contractures. The MEPS improved from 73 +\/- 12 preoperatively to 93 +\/- 14 at the final evaluation (P < .001). The ROM and MEPS results at every follow-up were comparable for both traumatic and degenerative contractures. ROM improved regardless of the severity of contracture.","Conclusions: Arthroscopic elbow arthrolysis was similarly efficient in ROM restoration in both traumatic and degenerative contractures and regardless of the severity of contracture. After early deterioration, the achieved gain slowly recovers over a period of 6 months but may not recover to the ranges achieved during arthroscopy.

Observation of individual leaves can help to recognize their growth status and measure complex phenotypic traits. Current image-based leaf segmentation methods have problems due to highly restricted species and vulnerability toward canopy occlusion. In this work, we propose an individual leaf segmentation approach for dense plant point clouds using facet over-segmentation and facet region growing. The approach can be divided into three steps: (1) point cloud pre-processing, (2) facet over-segmentation, and (3) facet region growing for individual leaf segmentation. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient in segmenting individual leaves from 3D point clouds of greenhouse ornamentals such as Epipremnum aureum, Monstera deliciosa, and Calathea makoyana, and the average precision and recall are both above 90%. The results also reveal the wide applicability of the proposed methodology for point clouds scanned from different kinds of 3D imaging systems, such as stereo vision and Kinect v2. Moreover, our method is potentially applicable in a broad range of applications that aim at segmenting regular surfaces and objects from a point cloud.","2333":"Although many studies have been conducted on digital forensics, their viewpoints keep changing, and new studies are continuously required on fields that have not been researched yet.

The sensors were positioned inside a climate chamber and connected outside to a micro-controller via a network cable. The chamber temperature was increased systematically over a wide range from 20 degrees C to 55 degrees C. A set of calibration curves was produced from the best fitting second-order polynomial curves for the offset in temperature between the sensor and reference. An improvement in accuracy of +\/- 0.15 degrees C is with respect to the mentioned temperature range, compared to the significantly higher value reported of +\/- 0.5 degrees C by the manufacturer for similar conditions. In summary, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the calibration of a low-cost, smart sensor frequently used in research and academic projects over a useful range of temperatures.","2341":"In an increasingly connected and multidisciplinary world, we propose a new paradigm of web application development.

The same application can be used for a whole range of physically different peripherals, but similar from the logical point of view of data entry. This paper discusses the implementation of a pilot project, currently in a local network environment, where all the devices in the LAN are identified and described in an interface server. Users in the local network may, upon request, make use of such devices. The communication of these peripherals with the web applications will be carried out by a network of modules that run under the websocket technology. The whole process of communication and connection establishment is automatic and guided by the existing configurations in the interface server.

Representative works and future research trends are also addressed in this article.","2343":"Simulation of a multi-hop Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with different topologies and analysis of its performance in terms of number of messages exchanged and energy usage was done in this study. Sensor nodes in the simulation were modelled after an Arduino hardware system equipped with compatible radio transceiver for communication. The sensor nodes were configured in two network topologies, grid and random topology, for performance comparisons. Network sizes varied between 9 nodes and 256 nodes. Simulation was stopped when the communication link between the sensor nodes and their sink node broke down. It was obtained that grid topology has better performance, especially in small network size. Moreover, when the number of nodes in the network is higher, the performance of random topology network exceeds the grid's performance. Nonetheless, the lifetime span of the sensor network does not depend on the networks size or topology, rather on the available energy in each of the sensor nodes. We also have successfully improved the energy consumption model to account for more parameters of radio transceiver used in a WSN node. The energy needed to turn on and off the radio transceiver plays a significant part in the energy consumption of the sensor node.","2345":"Recent developments in the field of low-cost sensors enable the design and implementation of compact, inexpensive and portable sensing units for air pollution monitoring with fine-detailed spatial and temporal resolution, in order to support applications of wider interest in the area of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this context, the present work advances the concept of developing a low-cost portable air pollution monitoring system (APMS) for measuring the concentrations of particulate matter (PM), in particular fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5). Specifically, this paper presents the on-field testing of the proposed low-cost APMS implementation using roadside measurements from a mobile laboratory equipped with a calibrated instrument as the basis of comparison and showcases its accuracy on characterizing the PM2.5 concentrations on 1 min resolution in an on-road trial. Moreover, it demonstrates the intended application of collecting fine-grained spatio-temporal PM2.5 profiles by mounting the developed APMS on an electric bike as a case study in the city of Mons, Belgium.","2347":"The new wave of huge data sources, also referred to as big data, entails new forms of information and content for Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Open data is the latest appeal in the open data philosophy and trends. In this article, we explore the affordances of (linked) open data for education in general and for CALL in particular. Learning analytics, adaptive learning environments, and open educational resources are the obvious beneficiaries, but contextualization of the learning process appears to be a relatively unexplored affordance. And this while available literature already touts its merits.","2348":"With the emergence of inexpensive 3D printing technology, open-source platforms for electronic prototyping and single-board computers, \"Do it Yourself\" (DIY) approaches to the cultivation of microbial cultures are becoming more feasible, user-friendly, and thus wider spread. In this perspective, we survey some of these approaches, as well as addon solutions to commercial instruments for synthetic and system biology applications. We discuss different cultivation designs, including capabilrties and limitations. Our intention is to encourage the reader to consider the DIY solutions. Overall, custom cultivation devices offer controlled growth environments with in-line monitoring of, for example, optical density, fluorescence, pH, and dissolved oxygen, all at affordable prices. Moreover, they offer a great degree of flexibility for different applications and requirements and are fun to design and construct. We include several illustrative examples, such as gaining optogenetic control and adaptive laboratory evolution experiments.","2349":"This paper addresses the problem of autonomous trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor in a global positioning system (GPS)-denied environment using only onboard sensing. To achieve that goal, it requires accurate estimation of quadrotor states followed by proper control actions. For the position estimation in a GPS-denied environment, an open source high speed optical flow sensor PX4FLOW is adopted. As for the quadrotor control, there are several challenges due to its highly nonlinear system dynamics, such as underactuation, coupling, model uncertainties, and external disturbances. To deal with those challenges, the cascaded inner-outer uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based robust control scheme has been developed and applied to the attitude and position control of a quadrotor. Extensive real flight experiments, including attitude stabilization, hover, disturbance rejection, trajectory tracking, and comparison with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed UDE-based controllers.","2351":"BGI (hua da ji ying; China Great Gene) counts among the world's largest and wealthiest institutions for biomedical research. Located in Shenzhen, the new megacity in southern China, BGI is now a critical site for understanding the relationship between biomedicine and the economic development of China. This essay uses performance studies and the notion of shanzhai (copycatting) to understanding how this laboratory poses a challenge to traditional modes of understanding technoscience. This marks an attempt to understand BGI, its work, and its workers on their own terms, or at least on local terms. Just as shanzhai challenges our notions of originality, BGI's hybridity challenges our notions of where and how scientific knowledge is produced. Performing not merely as a laboratory, but also, and at the same time, as a factory, and a company, BGI is an unfamiliar kind of hybrid scientific-industrial-commercial-governmental-philanthropic space that draws its repertoire from its very particular regional, national, and local-urban circumstances.","2354":"Even novice engineers and non-technical students can design and build an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype in four days. We present a setup for rapid IoT prototyping in a classroom, identify necessary skills and combine these to a workshop that allows students to turn their ideas into prototypes. Our approach enables fast prototyping cycle, using a common and welle-stablished development board and a computer. Arduino Uno is used for device prototyping and a Python program running on the same computer handles the needed Internet communications. A web server handles device and web client connectivity, logging and data monitoring. The method makes it possible to learn the needed basic skills in manageable steps, allowing students to focus on the actual prototype instead of struggling with the wireless and Internet communication problems. After the prototyping phase, the device can be ported to inexpensive and small ESP8266 based microcontroller. Compared to developing IoT prototypes directly with ESP8266, the setup presented is considerably faster. The whole process is based on free software tools which provides a possibility to utilize prototypes commercially, without a risk of a third party changing or discontinuing services. We arranged an experimental four-day workshop for university students (n = 19) from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of technical skills. All teams successfully built a working prototype based on their own ideas. Student self-assessment of programming skills was noticeably improved during the course. We later repeated the experiment with another group (n = 27) in a university of applied sciences, getting similar results. Our results indicate that this method is effective for learning IoT prototyping skills in a short time.","2355":"The vision-based mobile robot's simultaneous localisation and mapping and navigation capability in dynamic environments are highly problematic elements of robot vision applications. The goal of this study is to reconstruct a static map and track the dynamic object for a camera and laser scanner system. An improved automatic calibration is designed to merge image and laser point clouds. Then, the fusion data is exploited to detect the slowly moved object and reconstruct static map. Tracking-by-detection requires the correct assignment of noisy detection results to object trajectories. In the proposed method, occluded regions are combined 3D motion models with object appearance to manage difficulties in crowded scenes. The proposed method was validated by experimental results gathered in a real environment and on publicly available data.","2358":"In the last decade, wireless positioning systems have drawn a strong interest from a research point of view, especially for indoor environments where Global Positioning Systems (GPS) is not available. As an alternative, emerging applications relying on Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) communication technology have been proposed to offer a ranging accuracy in the order of some dozens of centimeters. Indeed, UWB radios' increased accuracy originates in the high time resolution of UWB signals that can be leveraged to measure precisely travel times of signals (e.g. Time of Flight, ToF). ToF can be easily translated to inter-node distance. In this work we propose N-TWR, a ToF-based N-ary ranging protocol created for localization using UWB. The proposed N-TWR protocol is based on the estimation of the ToF between a target node to be localized (which may be mobile or static) and a set of N anchors. It has been designed to minimize the number of messages exchanged between all nodes compared to a naive solution that exploits the state-of-the-art UWB ranging method. Validation has been made using experiments carried out in our Open Source Framework, DecaDuino, which enables fast prototyping of protocols sitting on top of UWB Physical layer. The N-ary ranging provided by N-TWR achieves the same level of accuracy as the naive protocol exploiting SDS-TWR but using four times less messages. We exhibit as well that N-TWR can be efficiently leveraged to design a simple and elegant trilateration localization algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In general, existing WSNs are mainly used for applications that require delay-tolerance and low-computation due to the poor resources of traditional sensor nodes in WSNs. However, compared to the traditional sensor nodes, today's devices for WSNs have more powerful resource. Thus, sensor nodes these days not only conduct sensing and transmitting data to servers but also are able to process many operations, so more diverse applications can be applied to WSNs. Especially, many applications using audio data have been proposed because audio is one of the most widely used data types, and many mobile devices already have a built-in microphone. However, many of the applications have a requirement that heavy-operations should be done by a tight deadline, so it is difficult for a single node in WSNs to run relatively heavy applications by itself. In this paper, to overcome this limitation of WSNs, we propose a new emerging system, HeaLow, a cooperative computing system for heavy-computation and low-latency processing in WSNs. We designed HeaLow and carried out the practical implementation on real devices. We confirmed the effectiveness of HeaLow through various experiments using the real devices and simulations. Using HeaLow, nodes in WSNs are able to perform heavy-computation processes while satisfying a completion time requirement.","2361":"In this paper, we propose a compact electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system and a user interface for control and monitoring over the Internet. Since the proposed system is much smaller than existing devices and does not need input\/output (I\/O) devices, it is easy to install and prevents inadvertent user interaction. The proposed system can increase the efficiency of biological testing devices such as ECIS systems that require long-term experiments at long intervals. The temporal impedance change is measured and recorded on the embedded computer in the proposed system, and the resulting data can be displayed and controlled over the Internet using a web-based graphical user interface (GUI). Bioengineers are currently using the proposed systems for cell culture experiments and are very satisfied with the ease of installation and the ability to observe the experimental situation anytime and anywhere.","2363":"The article describes an innovative mechatronic device for hand rehabilitation, which enables diagnostics, comprehensive exercises and reporting the rehabilitation results of individual fingers of people who have lost their full efficiency as a result of past illnesses (i.a. stroke) and orthopedic injuries.

The developed mechatronic device works with original software for PCs containing a diagnostic module, reporting module and a set of virtual reality exercises using biofeedback. The device uses auditory and visual biofeedback, and electromyography (EMG).","2366":"Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) and other additive manufacturing methods provide part design options that would be difficult or impossible to realize with conventional manufacturing methods. However, the mechanical properties of parts produced with MEAM are lower than bulk material properties because of the interfaces between roads and layers inherent to the additive build technique of MEAM. In addition, the success of the MEAM process and the resulting part quality depend on the proper selection of the many settings and variables present in MEAM. The effects of material dependent MEAM process parameters on the interlayer bonding and percent crystallinity of MEAM parts fabricated with polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) were examined in this study using a design of experiments technique known as the Taguchi method. The MEAM parameters studied were print temperature, heat-treatment time, and heat-treatment temperature. MEAM parts were tested perpendicular to the layers in order to characterize the interlayer bonding. Heat-treatment temperature was shown to be the most influential parameter on all the studied properties. Utilizing heat-treatments on MEAM parts increased the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) from 52% of the PPS film UTS to 80%. Similar increases were seen in the Young's modulus, from 57% of the PPS film Young's modulus to 72%. The study showed that utilizing post-processing heat-treatments on MEAM parts could improve the interlayer bonding in these parts. The use of these heat-treatments could be applied to other materials in order to increase the use of MEAM parts in end use applications.","2368":"This article reviews the potential of kite-mapping as part of an interdisciplinary and multinational field course. It situates kite-mapping as a low cost, high quality, participatory approach, in relation to field use of maps, arguing that research might usefully attend to more than simply the skills acquired during the field exercise and the technicalities of the innovation. Evidenced from two day-long workshops on the Maltese island of Gozo we describe practical issues involved in making the mapping work. We draw on descriptions of field practice and deploy a multi-method evaluation of staff and student reactions and experiences to explore pedagogic aspects of kite-mapping. We conclude that the practices of kite-mapping significantly impact upon the value of the mapping technique, and highlight how creative and playful mapping processes implicit in the technique might usefully be deployed in other field contexts.","2369":"The rise of a maker movement, located in hacker and makerspaces and involving the democratization of technologies of production and support of grassroots innovation, is receiving increasing attention from science and technology studies (STS) scholarship. This article explores how hacking is characterized by users of hacker and makerspaces and relates this to broader discussion of the maker movement as, for instance, promoting innovation, engaged in countercultural critique, or as accessible to anyone. Based on an interview study of users of twelve hacker and makerspaces across the United States, it argues that for these users, hacking is not about politics, commercial innovation, or critique. Rather, it is understood as a lifestyle one subscribes to, a meaningful leisure activity, or as providing access to a welcoming and close-knit community. Contrary to expectations of the maker movement as heralding social change, the benefits of hacking were viewed as personal rather than political, economic, or social; similarly, democratization of technology was experienced as rather incidental to most hackers' and makers' experiences.","2371":"This article presents an Internet of Things architecture for Smart Homes that specifically targets service composition and reconfiguration as enablers for the actuation and smart behavior capabilities. To this end, the main challenge that has to be addressed is the support to a seamless integration, composition, and reconfiguration of Internet of Things objects. Two enabling technologies are proposed here: a planning strategy based on a common-sense reasoning approach for service composition and a virtual-network protocol for Inter-Domain Messaging. The planner will identify the services that, properly connected, will cater for arisen, and therefore, unexpected needs. The virtual-network protocol will provide the support for this interconnection to take place in a transparent and orthogonal manner. This is particularly important to enable autonomous systems to instantiate composite services. To demonstrate the capabilities of the resulting framework, two use cases are presented, which under real circumstances demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.","2373":null,"2377":"The monitoring and control of renewable energy sources (RESs) based on DC (Direct Current) microgrids (DC MG) are gaining much consideration at this time. In comparison with the isolated individual control of converters in a microgrid, DC microgrids provide better voltage regulation and harmonized energy generation\/consumption. To address the inherent vulnerability of communication links, robust methods have been proposed that improve the resilience of communication-based control. However, the failure of the communication links in microgrid control layers remains a considerable issue that may lead to one or more nodes being disconnected and operating as a communication island. Such types of communication islanding may cause the unpredictable behavior of the system and further destabilization may lead to a cascaded failure. This paper proposes a fast algorithm to detect and evaluate network connectivity based on the information stored at every node in the form of a look-up table. The control structure has been modified under communication islanding, and a communication connectivity observer is used at every node to detect and address power flow issues under communication islanding. The proposed method has been verified through mathematical analysis, simulation, and experimental results.","2378":["Optogenetic switches permit accurate control of gene expression upon light stimulation. These synthetic switches have become a powerful tool for gene regulation, allowing modulation of customized phenotypes, overcoming the obstacles of chemical inducers, and replacing their use by an inexpensive resource: light. In this work, we implemented FUN-LOV, an optogenetic switch based on the photon-regulated interaction of WC-1 and WD, two LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) blue-light photoreceptors from the fungus Neurospora crassa. When tested in yeast, FUN-LOV yields light-controlled gene expression with exquisite temporal resolution and a broad dynamic range of over 1,300-fold, as measured by a luciferase reporter. We also tested the FUN-LOV switch for heterologous protein expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where Western blot analysis confirmed strong induction upon light stimulation, surpassing by 2.5 times the levels achieved with a classic GAL4\/galactose chemical-inducible system. Additionally, we utilized FUN-LOV to control the ability of yeast cells to flocculate. Light-controlled expression of the flocculin-encoding gene FLO1, by the FUN-LOV switch, yielded flocculation in light (FIL), whereas the lightcontrolled expression of the corepressor TUP1 provided flocculation in darkness (FID). Altogether, the results reveal the potential of the FUN-LOV optogenetic switch to control two biotechnologically relevant phenotypes such as heterologous protein expression and flocculation, paving the road for the engineering of new yeast strains for industrial applications. Importantly, FUN-LOV's ability to accurately manipulate gene expression, with a high temporal dynamic range, can be exploited in the analysis of diverse biological processes in various organisms.","IMPORTANCE Optogenetic switches are molecular devices which allow the control of different cellular processes by light, such as gene expression, providing a versatile alternative to chemical inducers. Here, we report a novel optogenetic switch (FUN-LOV) based on the LOV domain interaction of two blue-light photoreceptors (WC-1 and WD) from the fungus N. crassa. In yeast cells, FUN-LOV allowed tight regulation of gene expression, with low background in darkness and a highly dynamic and potent control by light. We used FUN-LOV to optogenetically manipulate, in yeast, two biotechnologically relevant phenotypes, heterologous protein expression and flocculation, resulting in strains with potential industrial applications.

However, not all these data are suitable to be automatically collected. This is especially true for emotions and mood. Moreover, users without experience in self-tracking may have a misperception of PI applications' limits and potentialities. We believe that current PI tools are not designed with enough understanding of such users' needs, desires, and problems they may encounter in their everyday lives. We designed and prototype the Mood TUI (Tangible User Interface), a PI tool that supports the self-reporting of mood data using a tangible interface. The platform is able to gather six different mood states and it was tested through several participatory design sessions in a secondary\/high school. The solution proposed allows gathering mood values in an amusing, simple, and appealing way. Users appreciated the prototypes, suggesting several possible improvements as well as ideas on how to use the prototype in similar or totally different contexts, and giving us hints for future research.","2384":"In the healthcare domain, Wireless Body Area Network has emerged as a vital technology that is capable of providing better methods to diagnose various hazardous diseases. The CANet projet is a project that proposes alternative monitoring solutions. This paper studies the possibility of transmitting different types of information through an IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer that not supports the transmission of heterogeneous information. We have proposed an extension to the MAC layer which makes possible the transmission of various information types. This solution designed by \"diffrentiation layer'' uses a purge function to ensure the use of CAP and CFP by the same node in the same superframe and allows the differentiation between several information. Our results show that our solution is reliable under worst-case.","2385":"While cellular networks connect over 3.7 billion people worldwide, their availability and quality is not uniform across regions. Under-provisioned and overloaded networks, as are common in rural or post-disaster areas, lead to poor network performance and a poor-quality user experience. To address this problem, we propose HybridCell: a system that leverages locally-owned small-scale cellular networks to augment the operation of overloaded commercial networks. HybridCell is the first system to allow a user with their existing SIM card and mobile phone to seamlessly switch between commercial and local networks in order to maintain continuous connectivity. HybridCell accomplishes this by identifying poorly-performing networks and taking action to provide seamless cellular connectivity to end users. Using traces from commercial cellular networks collected during our visit to the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan, we demonstrate HybridCell's capability to detect and act upon commercial network overload, offering an alternate communication channel during times of congestion. We show that even in scenarios where provider networks deny calls due to overload, HybridCell is able to accommodate users and facilitate local calling.","2386":"A high wearable instrument for brain-computer interface (BCI), based on steady-state visual evoked potentials, and conceived with low-cost, off-the-shelf components, is proposed. Peculiar features are: 1) a single-channel differential acquisition; 2) active transducers using dry electrodes with metallic pins; 3) real-time computation based on Goertzel algorithm, lighter than fast Fourier transform; and 4) absence of training need before the first use. In this way, the proposed instrument overcomes the state-of-the art issues of comfort, wearability, signal quality, and feasibility on limited resources devices (e.g., tablets or smartphones) of BCI applications. The accuracy results of the instrument prototype, assessed in an experimental campaign on human subjects in laboratory, foster its application in wearable biomedical devices.","2387":"The world is resorting to the Internet of Things (IoT) for ease of control and monitoring of smart devices. The ubiquitous use of IoT ranges from industrial control systems (ICS) to c-Health, e-Commerce, smart cities, supply chain management, smart cars, cyber physical systems (CPS), and a lot more. Such reliance on IoT is resulting in a significant amount of data to be generated, collected, processed, and analyzed. The big data analytics is no doubt beneficial for business development. However, at the same time, numerous threats to the availability and privacy of the user data, message, and device integrity, the vulnerability of IoT devices to malware attacks and the risk of physical compromise of devices pose a significant danger to the sustenance of IoT. This paper thus endeavors to highlight most of the known threats at various layers of the IoT architecture with a focus on the anatomy of malware attacks. We present a detailed attack methodology adopted by some of the most successful malware attacks on IoT, including ICS and CPS. We also deduce an attack strategy of a distributed denial of service attack through IoT botnet followed by requisite security measures. In the end, we propose a composite guideline for the development of an IoT security framework based on industry best practices and also highlight lessons learned, pitfalls and some open research challenges.","2388":"Side-channel attacks are a prominent threat to the security of embedded systems. To perform them, an adversary evaluates the goodness of fit of a set of key-dependent power consumption models to a collection of side-channel measurements taken from an actual device, identifying the secret key value as the one yielding the best-fitting model. In this work, we analyze for the first time the microarchitectural components of a 32-bit in-order RISC CPU, showing which one of them is accountable for unexpected side-channel information leakage. We classify the leakage sources, identifying the data serialization points in the microarchitecture and providing a set of hints that can be fruitfully exploited to generate implementations resistant against side-channel attacks, either writing or generating proper assembly code.","2389":"We introduce the Xpuck swarm, a research platform with an aggregate raw processing power in excess of two teraflops. The swarm uses 16 e-puck robots augmented with custom hardware that uses the substantial CPU and GPU processing power available from modern mobile system-on-chip devices. The augmented robots, called Xpucks, have at least an order of magnitude greater performance than previous swarm robotics platforms. The platform enables new experiments that require high individual robot computation and multiple robots. Uses include online evolution or learning of swarm controllers, simulation for answering what-if questions about possible actions, distributed super-computing for mobile platforms, and real-world applications of swarm robotics that requires image processing, or SLAM. The tera flop swarm could also be used to explore swarming in nature by providing platforms with similar computational power as simple insects. We demonstrate the computational capability of the swarm by implementing a fast physics-based robot simulator and using this within a distributed island model evolutionary system, all hosted on the Xpucks.","2391":"With tiny and limited nervous systems, insects demonstrate a remarkable ability to fly through complex environments. Optic flow has been identified to play a crucial role in regulating flight conditions and navigation in flies and bees. In robotics, optic flow has been widely studied thanks to the low computational requirements. However, with only monocular visual information, optic flow is inherently devoid of a scale factor required for estimating the absolute distance. In this paper, we propose a strategy for estimating the flight altitude of a flying robot with a ventral camera by combining the optic flow with measurements from an inertial measurement unit. Instead of using the prevalent feature-based approach for calculation of optic flow, we implement a direct method that evaluates the flow information via image gradients. We show that the direct approach notably simplifies the computation steps compared to the feature-based method. When combined with an extended Kalman filter for fusion of inertial measurement units measurements, the flight altitude can be estimated in real time. We carried out extensive flight tests in different settings. Among 31 hovering and vertical flights near the altitude of 40 cm, we achieved the RMS errors in the altitude estimate of 2.51 cm. Further analysis of factors that affect the quality of the flow and the distance estimate is also provided.","2392":"The use of ultrasounds has been implemented to increase yeast viability, de-foaming, and cavitation in foods and beverages. However, the application of low frequency audible sound to decrease bubble size and improve foamability has not been explored. In this study, three treatments using India Pale Ale beers were tested, which include (1) a control, (2) the application of audible sound during fermentation, and (3) the application of audible sound during natural carbonation. Five different audible frequencies (20 Hz, 30 Hz, 45 Hz, 55 Hz, and 75 Hz) were applied daily for one minute each (starting from the lowest frequency) during fermentation (11 days, treatment 2) and carbonation (22 days, treatment 3). Samples were measured in triplicates using the RoboBEER to assess color and foam-related parameters. A trained panel (n = 10) evaluated the intensity of sensory descriptors. Results showed that samples with sonication treatment had significant differences in the number of small bubbles, alcohol, and viscosity compared to the control. Furthermore, except for foam texture, foam height, and viscosity, there were non-significant differences in the intensity of any sensory descriptor, according to the rating from the trained sensory panel. The use of soundwaves is a potential treatment for brewing to improve beer quality by increasing the number of small bubbles and foamability without disrupting yeast or modifying the aroma and flavor profile.","2393":"The present research proposes a novel emotion recognition framework for the computer prediction of human emotions using common wearable biosensors. Emotional perception promotes specific patterns of biological responses in the human body, and this can be sensed and used to predict emotions using only biomedical measurements. Based on theoretical and empirical psychophysiological research, the foundation of autonomic specificity facilitates the establishment of a strong background for recognising human emotions using machine learning on physiological patterning. However, a systematic way of choosing the physiological data covering the elicited emotional responses for recognising the target emotions is not obvious. The current study demonstrates through experimental measurements the coverage of emotion recognition using common off-the-shelf wearable biosensors based on the synchronisation between audiovisual stimuli and the corresponding physiological responses. The work forms the basis of validating the hypothesis for emotional state recognition in the literature and presents coverage of the use of common wearable biosensors coupled with a novel preprocessing algorithm to demonstrate the practical prediction of the emotional states of wearers.","2394":"Research in photobiology is currently limited by a lack of devices capable of delivering precise and tunable irradiation to cells in a high-throughput format. This limits researchers to using expensive commercially available or custom-built light sources which make it difficult to replicate, standardize, optimize, and scale experiments. Here we present an open-source Microplate Photoirradiation System (MPS) developed to enable high-throughput light experiments in standard 96 and 24-well microplates for a variety of applications in photobiology research. This open-source system features 96 independently controlled LEDs (4 LEDs per well in 24-well), Wi-Fi connected control and programmable graphical user interface (GUI) for control and programming, automated calibration GUI, and modular control and LED boards for maximum flexibility. A web-based GUI generates light program files containing irradiation parameters for groups of LEDs. These parameters are then uploaded wirelessly, stored and used on the MPS to run photoirradiation experiments inside any incubator. A rapid and semi-quantitative porphyrin metabolism assay was also developed to validate the system in wild-type fibroblasts. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence accumulation was induced by incubation with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a photosensitization method leveraged clinically to destroy malignant cell types in a process termed photodynamic therapy (PDT), and cells were irradiated with 405nm light with varying irradiance, duration and pulsation parameters. Immediately after light treatment with the MPS, subsequent photobleaching was measured in live, adherent cells in both 96-well and a 24-well microplates using a microplate reader. Results demonstrate the utility and reliability of the Microplate Photoirradiation System to irradiate cells with precise irradiance and timing parameters in order to measure PpIx photobleaching kinetics in live adherent cells and perform comparable experiments with both 24 and 96 well microplate formats. The high-throughput capability of the MPS enabled measurement of enough irradiance conditions in a single microplate to fit PpIX fluorescence to a bioexponential decay model of photobleaching, as well as reveal a dependency of photobleaching on duty-cycle-but not frequency-in a pulsed irradiance regimen.","2395":"Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) established during the past two decades unlocked heterogeneous geospatial datasets. The European Union INSPIRE Directive laid down the foundation of a pan-European SDI where thousands of public sector data providers make their data, including sensor observations, available for cross-border and cross-domain reuse. At the same time, SDIs should inevitably adopt new technology and standards to remain fit for purpose and address in the best possible way the needs of different stakeholders (government, businesses and citizens). Some of the recurring technical requirements raised by SDI stakeholders include: (i) the need for adoption of RESTful architectures; together with (ii) alternative (to GML) data encodings, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and binary exchange formats; and (iii) adoption of asynchronous publish-subscribe-based messaging protocols. The newly established OGC standard SensorThings API is particularly interesting to investigate for INSPIRE, as it addresses together all three topics. In this manuscript, we provide our synthesised perspective on the necessary steps for the OGC SensorThings API standard to be considered as a solution that meets the legal obligations stemming out of the INSPIRE Directive. We share our perspective on what should be done concerning: (i) data encoding; and (ii) the use of SensorThings API as a download service.","2396":["Purpose This study aims to understand their emergence and types of business models in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.","Design\/methodology\/approach The paper builds upon a systematic literature review of IoT ecosystems and business models to construct a conceptual framework on IoT business models, and uses qualitative research methods to analyze seven industry cases.","Findings The study identifies four types of IoT business models: value chain efficiency, industry collaboration, horizontal market and platform.

This effort generated NASA's first grand challenge, the Asteroid Grand Challenge (AGC), a large-scale effort using multidisciplinary collaborations and innovative engagement mechanisms, that focused on finding and addressing asteroid threats to human populations. In April 2010, President Barack Obama announced a mission to send humans to an asteroid by 2025. This resulted in the agency's Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) to leverage and maximize existing robotic and human efforts to capture and reroute an asteroid, with the goal of eventual human exploration. The AGC, initiated in 2013, complemented ARM by expanding public participation, partnerships, and other approaches to find, understand, and overcome these potentially harmful asteroids. This article describes a selection of AGC activities implemented from 2013 to 2017 and their results, excluding those conducted by NASA's Near-Earth Object Observations Program and other organizations. The strategic development of the initiative is outlined as well as initial successes, strengths, and weaknesses resulting from the first 4 years of AGC activities and approaches. Finally, we describe lesson learned and areas for continued work and study. The AGC lessons learned and strategies could inform the work of other agencies and organizations seeking to conduct a global scientific investigation with matrixed organizational support, multiple strategic partners, and numerous internal and external open innovation approaches and audiences.

As complex socio-ecological systems, river basins in western Europe could benefit from further support for inclusive management schemes. This paper makes use of case studies from Germany, England and Spain to explore the potential opportunities and challenges of different participatory management approaches. Grounded in theoretical considerations around participation within ecological management schemes, including Arnstein's Ladder of Participation and commons theories, this work provides an evaluation of each case study based on key indicators, such as inclusivity, representativeness, self-organization, decision-making power, spatial fit and temporal continuity. As investors and the public develop a heightened awareness for long-term sustainability of industrial projects, this analysis supports the suggestion that increased participatory river basin management is both desirable and economically feasible, and should thus be considered a viable option for future projects aiming to move beyond current requirements of the European Union Water Framework Directive.

In this context, many-core accelerators are a viable solution to efficiently execute highly parallel kernels. However, architectural constraints impose hard limits on the main memory bandwidth, and push for software techniques which optimize the memory usage of complex multi-kernel applications. In this work, we propose a set of techniques, mainly based on graph analysis and image tiling, targeted to accelerate the execution of image processing applications expressed as standard OpenVX graphs on cluster-based many-core accelerators. We have developed a run-time framework which implements these techniques using a front-end compliant to the OpenVX standard, and based on an OpenCL extension that enables more explicit control and efficient reuse of on-chip memory and greatly reduces the recourse to off-chip memory for storing intermediate results. Experiments performed on the STHORM many-core accelerator demonstrate that our approach leads to massive reduction of time and bandwidth, even when the main memory bandwidth for the accelerator is severely constrained.","2400":"This article explores the scientific and methodological background of the creation and development of the cloud-based learning and research environment in the context of open science priorities and the European Research Area (ERA) formation. The conceptual and terminology body of the cloud-based environment investigation and the main features of such an environment are delineated. The main methodological principles of the environment design and development, for instance, the principles of open science, open education and also the specific principles inherent to the cloud-based systems are described. The study aim is to analyze the conceptual body, principles, and features of the formation and development of the cloud-based educational and research environment in the context of the open science concept. The objective of the study is to determine the prospects of cloud technologies that are used to support educational and scientific activities and to outline the principles and technologies of open science use and explore their broader application in pedagogical systems of higher educational institutions.

The results of the research substantiate cloud technologies in the principles of creation and development of the learning and research environment (LRE) of a higher education institution. The concept of the cloud-based environment is explained; the characteristic features of its functioning are outlined. Additionally, the prospects and estimation of the cloud-based LRE development in the aspect of open science are defined. Conclusions and recommendations encompass the application of cloud-based open science technologies covering European research infrastructures, scientific and educational networks, European open science cloud, and also cloud services for collecting, submitting and processing data as a topical and promising trend for the development and modernization of the learning and research environment of higher education institutions.","2405":"In this paper, we explore the potential of mobile robots with simulation-based internal models for safety in highly dynamic environments. We propose a robot with a simulation of itself, other dynamic actors and its environment, inside itself. Operating in real time, this simulation-based internal model is able to look ahead and predict the consequences of both the robot's own actions and those of the other dynamic actors in its vicinity. Hence, the robot continuously modifies its own actions in order to actively maintain its own safety while also achieving its goal. Inspired by the problem of how mobile robots could move quickly and safely through crowds of moving humans, we present experimental results which compare the performance of our internal simulation-based controller with a purely reactive approach as a proof-of-concept study for the practical use of simulation-based internal models.","2406":"The application of computer vision algorithms and chemometric fingerprinting using near-infrared spectrometry (NIR) of plant leaves, offers enhanced capabilities for ampelography by providing more accurate methods to discriminate leaves based on morphological parameters, and chemometrics, respectively. This paper showed that machine learning algorithms based on morpho-colorimetric parameters and NIR analysis separately, were able to automatically classify leaves of 16 grapevine cultivars. The artificial neural network (ANN) model developed with morpho-colorimetric parameters as inputs (Model 1), and 16 cultivars as targets, rendered an accuracy of 94% to classify leaves for all cultivars studied. The ANN model obtained with the NIR spectra per leaf as inputs (Model 2), and the real classification as targets, rendered 92% accuracy. The automatic extraction of morpho-colorimetric data, NIR chemical fingerprinting and machine learning modelling rendered rapid, accurate and non-destructive methods for cultivar classification, which can aid management practices.","2410":"The ocean covers nearly two-thirds of the surface on the Earth, and there has been great interest in developing underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) to help us explore the ocean realm. A great deal of efforts have been devoted to it, and significant progress has been made since the beginning of 2000s. However, most of the networks are isolatedly developed currently, inherently hardware-based and application-oriented with inflexible closed-form architectures, which are difficult to reconfigure, reprogram and evolve. They also lack the capability in sharing resources, and are far from service-oriented networks. These limitations impair their capacity for wide range of applications. To further propel the development of UWSNs, next-generation UWSNs have been proposed recently, which are robust, flexible, adaptive, programmable, support resource-sharing feature and are easy to manage and evolve. Moreover, a number of novel software-defined techniques and paradigms, such as software-defined radio, cognitive acoustic radio, network function virtualization, software-defined networking, Internet of Underwater Things, and sensor-cloud, have been emerging. These software-defined technologies have the capability of softwarizing network resources, and then redefining them to satisfy diverse application requirements, improve resource utilization efficiency and simplify network management. Consequently, these evolving technologies are envisioned as critical building blocks and major driving forces, which will transform conventional UWSNs toward software-based, programmable, user-customizable, and service-oriented next-generation UWSNs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing works on implementing these techniques, and also present discussions for future research. We hope to inspire more active research on these areas and take a step further toward realizing next-generation UWSNs.","2411":"The development of an inexpensive robotic platform is presented. Our aim is to provide a complete low-cost hardware tool to illustrate control system methods. The capabilities of this platform allow both, researchers and students, to implement from basic techniques to complex ones (e.g., from model-based control techniques to multiagent dynamical systems). The hardware that has been designed and developed performs experiments for single or multiple robot control employing capabilities, such as locomotion, communication, perception, and autonomous decision making. We illustrate different control and system dynamics techniques using this platform. After presenting the model and navigation strategies, single-agent techniques that ensure safe and predictable navigation are shown (PID and fuzzy logic controllers). Then, two multiagent techniques are described in order to prove the versatility of the platform. The first strategy illustrates common problems that arise in nature and power systems (phase synchronization models based on pulse-coupled biological oscillators and the Kuramoto oscillator). Second, a game theoretical approach for multirobot consensus is shown. In all these cases, experimental results show the performance of the platform.","2413":"An educational robot is described, which is designed and constructed for use in the laboratory of Principles of Electrical Engineering. The discrete nature of design, conforming to a simple block strategy, allows for fairly easy introduction of basic and fundamental concepts of Electrical Engineering to the freshman students, including control, actuation, wireless signal transmission, and analogue\/digital conversions. Each block or module represents one or few engineering ideas and helps the students to understand the interplay and connection between system divisions, and enhance their creative thinking. Circuits are designed and implemented such that both structure and functionality of each module are clearly presented.

Numerous pan-sharpening methods are based on intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform, which may cause evident spectral distortion. To address this problem, an IHS-based pan-sharpening method using ripplet transform and compressed sensing is proposed. Firstly, the IHS transform is applied to the MS image to separate intensity components. Secondly, discrete ripplet transform (DRT) is implemented on the intensity component and the PAN image to obtain multi-scale sub-images. High-frequency sub-images are fused by a local variance algorithm and, for low-frequency sub-images, compressed sensing is introduced for the reconstruction of the intensity component so as to integrate the local information from both the intensity component and the PAN image. The specific fusion rule is defined by local difference. Finally, the inverse ripplet transform and inverse IHS transform are coupled to generate the pan-sharpened image. The proposed method is compared with five state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods and also the Gram-Schmidt (GS) method through visual and quantitative analysis of WorldView-2, Pleiades and Triplesat datasets. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieves relatively higher spatial resolution and more desirable spectral fidelity.","2417":"Based on a review of literature connecting degrowth and business, we attempt to operationalize degrowth in the context of business activity, and consider what degrowth can add to the business models for sustainability discussed so far. In most discussions on degrowth, economic activity has been reduced to relatively marginal activities. We see a need to connect degrowth to more typical business activities, because business is an essential part of the modern world. We put forward seven criteria which can be used to assess whether a company follows the degrowth paradigm: (1) Alternative understanding of business; (2) From business activity to activism and social movement; (3) Collaborative value creation; (4) Democratic governance; (5) Corporate leaders' commitment to company values in personal life; (6) Reduction of environmental impacts at all stages of product\/service life-cycle; (7) Making products that last and are repairable. We use these criteria to assess the performance of a case study company, Patagonia, which is known for its environmental and social record. Our assessment is not meant to be comprehensive, but to illustrate the relevance of the seven criteria. Our criteria offer guidance for aligning business activity with the broader degrowth objectives, and our analysis complements the recommendations made so far for degrowth in national and local policies.

While multiple designs for such robots have been proposed, they, typically, require custom-made components, which make replication and manufacturing difficult, and, mostly, employ non-modular integral designs. Furthermore, these robots' proposed small sizes tend to limit sensory perception capabilities and operational time. Some have resolved few of the above issues through the use of extensions that, unfortunately, add to their size.","In contribution to the pertinent field, thus, a novel millirobot with an open-source design, addressing the above concerns, is presented in this paper. Our proposed millirobot has a modular design and uses easy to source, off-the-shelf components. The milli-robot-Toronto (mROBerTO) also includes a variety of sensors and has a 16 x 16 mm(2) footprint. mROBerTO's wireless communication capabilities include ANT TM, Bluetooth Smart, or both simultaneously. Data-processing is handled by an ARM processor with 256 KB of flash memory. Additionally, the sensing modules allow for extending or changing the robot's perception capabilities without adding to the robot's size. For example, the swarm-sensing module, designed to facilitate swarm studies, allows for measuring proximity and bearing to neighboring robots and performing local communications.","Extensive experiments, some of which are presented herein, have illustrated the capability of mROBerTO units for use in implementing a variety of commonly proposed swarm algorithms."],"2420":"The present paper focuses on the design and fabrication of 1D and 2D optical scanners to characterize the spatial profile of electron beams. The basis of the two systems is the generation of color centers in glass plates by irradiation, followed by the scanning of the plates, illuminated by a fixed power source (LED) with a maximum power of 3 W in the spectral range of 520-560 nm, with a TCS3200 sensor. In both systems, 6 mm thick glass blades (SiO2 : 76%) are used instead of expensive dosimetric films. The experimental results section first focuses on the validation and calibration accuracy of the effective absorbance of the irradiated glass in the LED spectral range with a radiation dose of up to 20 kGy. Then, it describes how the 1D optical scanner was used to scan the spatial profile obtained under the scanning horn of a Rhodotron accelerator with a maximum radiation dose of 7.8 kGy. The experimental results obtained from this method are entirely consistent with the results of other research studies, while this method is more cost-efficient and accurate compared to the previously reported methods. The 2D optical scanner was also used to accurately measure the spatial profile of the Rhodotron electron beam in static mode by scanning the color centers generated by irradiation.","2421":"Using a multisensory interface system, we examined how people's emotional experiences change as their tactile sense (touching a plant) was augmented with visual sense (\"seeing\" their touch). Our system (the Interactive Plant system) senses the electrical capacitance of the human body and visualizes users' tactile information on a flat screen (when the touch is gentle, the program draws small and thin roots around the pot; when the touch is more harsh or abrupt, big and thick roots are displayed). We contrasted this multimodal combination (touch + vision) with a unimodal interface (touch only or watch only) and measured the impact of the multimodal interaction on participants' emotion. We found significant emotional gains in the multimodal interaction. Participants' self-reported positive affect, joviality, attentiveness and self-assurance increased dramatically in multimodal interaction relative to unimodal interaction; participants' electrodermal activity (EDA) increased in the multimodal condition, suggesting that our plant-based multisensory visual-tactile interaction raised arousal. We suggest that plant-based tactile interfaces are advantageous for emotion generation because haptic perception is by nature embodied and emotional.","2422":"This paper proposes the concept of e-velomobility. E-velomobility covers practices, systems and technologies of electrically-assisted cycling where velomobility's pedal-power combines with e-mobility's battery\/motor assistance to propel the rider. The concept draws on research and policies around e-mobility, velomobility and e-bikes. Results of an analysis of qualitative material from a UK trial of e-bikes illustrate how e-velomobility is experienced. The empirical material and the conceptual approach show e-velomobility as a distinct and important form of mobility with implications for research agendas and e-mobility policy. E-velomobility and the more diverse understanding of e-mobility suggested in this paper could support a shift of strategies and policies towards more active and sustainable as well as less expensive modes of e-mobility than the current focus on electric cars.","2425":"The present paper aims to evaluate the past and future environmental performance of the electricity generation in Brazil in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP). To that end, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool was used to evaluate the system's environmental performance, based on ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, using the Ecoinvent v 3.3 database. This study provides data on global warming by the GWP and GTP 100 years impact category. The functional unit and reference flow is kWh. The model was applied to the electricity generation in Brazil for the years 2016-2026 using Umberto NXT Universal software. The results indicate that the greatest environmental impacts lie on generation sources such as oil, natural gas, hydropower and hard coal. Carbon dioxide was the main contributor to atmospheric emissions in the life cycle of the Brazilian electricity matrix in 2016 and 2026. The total potential impact (and per kWh) is expected to decrease until 2021. The Brazilian electricity matrix is expected to be less pollutant in terms of carbon footprint until 2021. The study can contribute to directing public policies, promoting development actions and encouraging different electricity matrices.","2427":["Cloud Manufacturing (CM) is a service oriented business model to share manufacturing capabilities and resources on a cloud platform. Manufacturing is under pressure to achieve cost and environmental impact reductions, as manufacturing becomes more integrated and complex. Cloud manufacturing offers a solution, as it is capable of making intelligent decisions to provide the most sustainable and robust manufacturing route available. Although CM research has progressed, a consensus is still lacking on the concepts within CM as well 'as applications and scope beyond discrete manufacturing.","The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how CM offers a more sustainable manufacturing future to the industry as a whole, before focusing specifically on the application to process manufacturing (e.g. food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals). This paper details the definitions, characteristics, architectures and previous case studies on CM. From this, the fundamental aspects of the CM concept are identified, along with an analysis of how the concept has progressed. A new, comprehensive CM definition is formulated by combining key concepts drawn from previous definitions and emphasizes CM potential for sustainable manufacturing.","Four key methods of how CM increases sustainability are identified: (1) collaborative design; (2) greater automation; (3) improved process resilience and (4) enhanced waste reduction, reuse and recovery. The first two key methods are common to both discrete and process manufacturing, however key methods (3) and (4) are more process manufacturing specific and application of CM for these has yet to be fully realised. Examples of how CM's characteristics may be utilised to solve various process manufacturing problems are presented to demonstrate the applications of CM to process manufacturing. Waste is an important consideration in manufacturing, with strong sustainability implications. The current focus has been on using CM for waste minimisation; however, process manufacturing offers waste as a resource (valorisation opportunities from diversifying co-products, reuse, recycle and energy recovery). Exploring CM's potential to characterise and evaluate alternative process routes for the valorisation of process manufacturing waste is considered for the first time. The specific limitations preventing CM adoption by process manufacturers are discussed. Finally, CM's place in the future of manufacturing is explored, including how it will interact with, and complement other emerging manufacturing technologies to deliver a circular economy and personalised products.

Assuming the availability of double triaxial gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers, the possibility that fault can occur both in input (gyros outputs) and in output (accelerometers and magnetometers outputs) to the kinematic nonlinear relations underlying attitude estimation must be taken into account. If an extended Kalman filter (EKF) can compensate for biases on gyroscopes, fault detection, for all sensors, is first obtained with a comparison between homogeneous sensor outputs. Then, the isolation of the faulted gyro is carried out through the analysis of the EKF bias estimates, whereas a set-based approach is used to isolate faulted accelerometers or magnetometers. For these sensors, isolation tests involve the solution of a linear programming problem on a moving time window in the discrete time domain. In order to show the practical applicability and robustness against measurement noise and different kind of faults, a set of simulations involving experimental data collected during flights of a tricopter UAV are discussed.","2430":"Small flying robots can perform landing maneuvers using bio-inspired optical flow by maintaining a constant divergence. However, optical flow is typically estimated from frame sequences recorded by standard miniature cameras. This requires processing full images onboard, which limits the update rate of divergence measurements and thus the speed of the control loop and the robot. Event-based cameras overcome these limitations by only measuring pixel-level brightness changes atmicrosecond temporal accuracy, hence providing an efficient mechanism for optical flow estimation. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first work integrating event-based optical flow estimation into the control loop of a flying robot. We extend an existing \"local plane fitting\" algorithm to obtain an improved and more computationally efficient optical flow estimation method, which is valid for a wide range of optical flow velocities. This method is validated for real event sequences. In addition, a method for estimating the divergence from event-based optical flow is introduced that accounts for the aperture problem. The developed algorithms are implemented in a constant divergence landing controller onboard a quadrotor. Experiments show that, using event-based optical flow, accurate divergence estimates can be obtained over a wide range of speeds. This enables the quadrotor to perform very fast landing maneuvers.","2433":"Swarm robotics studies the intelligent collective behaviour emerging from long-term interactions of large number of simple robots. However, maintaining a large number of robots operational for long time periods requires significant battery capacity, which is an issue for small robots. Therefore, re-charging systems such as automated battery-swapping stations have been implemented. These systems require that the robots interrupt, albeit shortly, their activity, which influences the swarm behaviour. In this paper, a low-cost on-the-fly wireless charging system, composed of several charging cells, is proposed for use in swarm robotic research studies. To determine the system's ability to support perpetual swarm operation, a probabilistic model that takes into account the swarm size, robot behaviour and charging area configuration, is outlined. Based on the model, a prototype system with 12 charging cells and a small mobile robot, Mona, was developed. A series of long-term experiments with different arenas and behavioural configurations indicated the model's accuracy and demonstrated the system's ability to support perpetual operation of multi-robotic system.","2434":"This paper shows an interesting case of coastal landscape reconstruction by using innovative marine robotic instrumentation, applied to an archaeological key-site in the Campi Flegrei (Italy), one of the more inhabited areas in the Mediterranean during the Roman period. This active volcanic area is world famous for the ancient coastal cities of Baiae, Puteoli, and Misenum, places of military and commercial excellence. The multidisciplinary study of the submerged Roman harbour at Nisida Island was aimed at reconstructing the natural and anthropogenic underwater landscape by elaborating a multiscale dataset. The integrated marine surveys were carried out by an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) foreseeing the simultaneous use of geophysical and photogrammetric sensors according to the modern philosophy of multi-modal mapping. All instrumental measurements were validated by on-site measurements performed by specialised scuba divers. The multiscale analysis of the sensing data allowed a precise reconstruction of the coastal morpho-evolutive trend and the relative sea level variation in the last 2000 years by means of a new type of archaeological sea-level marker here proposed for the first time. Furthermore, it provided a detailed multidimensional documentation of the underwater cultural heritage and a useful tool for evaluating the conservation state of archaeological submerged structures.","2435":"The lack of sustainable solutions to mobility and transportation is a major problem in Latin American cities and requires prompt solutions. The main issues in Latin America are the high-cost of solutions, no inclusion of renewable energies, poor energy management, the use of foreign systems not adapted to local contexts, ineffective regional legislation and politics, among others. In this paper the main technical issues concerning the implementation of a bike-sharing system using pedaling-assisted (PAS) electric bicycles for Bogota City are discussed and a solution is proposed. To solve such problems, a methodology to design a tailored solution well suited to Bogota citizen's needs is developed. Such methodology starts with the development of an on-board-computer (OBC) in order to characterize bike-users by collecting a rider's data in real-time. Furthermore, the proposed solution develops a low-cost middle-drive (mid-drive) propulsion system for the PAS in the electric bike using brushless-DC (BLDC) motors and by implementing a field-oriented controller (FOC). The reported bike-sharing system also includes the development and implementation of two charging-stations that enable charging the battery on the electric bikes exclusively by using photovoltaic energy. Experimental results are presented and discussed.","2438":"In this study, we designed an oxygen supply and oxygen saturation monitoring (OSOSM) system. This OSOSM system can provide a continuous supply of oxygen and monitor the peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) of patients who accept radiotherapy and use an active breathing coordinator (ABC). A clinical test with 27 volunteers was conducted. The volunteers were divided into two groups based on the tendency of SpO2 decline in breath-holding without the OSOSM system: group A (12 cases) showed a decline in SpO2 of less than 2%, whereas the decline in SpO2 in group B (15 cases) was greater than 2% and reached up to 6% in some cases. The SpO2 of most volunteers declined during rest. The breath-holding time of group A without the OSOSM system was significantly longer than that of group B (p < 0.05) and was extended with the OSOSM system by 26.6% and 27.85% in groups A and B, respectively. The SpO2 recovery time was reduced by 36.1%, and the total rest time was reduced by 27.6% for all volunteers using the OSOSM system. In summary, SpO2 declines during breath-holding and rest time cannot be ignored while applying an ABC. This OSOSM system offers a simple and effective way to monitor SpO2 variation and overcome SpO2 decline, thereby lengthening breath-holding time and shortening rest time.","2439":"An integrated navigation scheme based on multiple optical flow sensors and a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) are presented, instead of the global position system (GPS) aided. Multiple optical flow sensors are mounted on a micro air vehicle (MAV) at different positions with different viewing directions for detecting optical flow around the MAV. A fault-tolerant decentralized extended Kalman filter (EKF) is performed for estimating navigation errors by fusing the inertial and optical flow measurements, which can prevent the estimation divergence caused by the failure of the optical flow sensor. Then, the estimation of navigation error is inputted into the SINS settlement process for correcting the SINS measurements. The results verify that the navigation errors of SINS can be effectively reduced (even more than 9\/10). Moreover, although the sensor is in a state of failure for 400 seconds, the fault-tolerant integrated navigation system can still work properly without divergence.","2440":"The present paper interrogates the status and the role of electronic and reactive textiles in domestic contexts. After a preliminary incursion into the modern definition of home and homing, the paper addresses the changes that took place in the domestic space due to the development of digital and communication technologies, Defined as a \"sensing home,\" as a \"communicating domestic space,\" smart homes are challenging the traditional understanding of home, defined in terms of intimacy and privacy. In this context, electronic and reactive textiles are asked to overcome the low acceptance of smart homes, through their technical, sensorial, and cultural dimensions, The paper highlights some of the pros and cons in accommodating the latest technological advances in the field of textiles, analyses the way physical computing allows textiles to transform into domotics (robots for domestic environments), presents some of the latest developments on soft architecture fabrication and argues in favor of a much more critical approach to the development of sensors and actuators in textile objects.","2441":"The nature of contemporary spatial data infrastructures lies in the provision of geospatial information in an on-demand fashion. Although recent applications identified the need to react to real-time information in a time-critical way, research efforts in the field of geospatial Internet of Things in particular have identified substantial gaps in this context, ranging from a lack of standardisation for event-based architectures to the meaningful handling of real-time information as \"events\". This manuscript presents work in the field of event-driven architectures as part of spatial data infrastructures with a particular focus on sensor networks and the devices capturing in-situ measurements. The current landscape of spatial data infrastructures is outlined and used as the basis for identifying existing gaps that retain certain geospatial applications from using real-time information. We present a selection of approaches-developed in different research projects-to overcome these gaps. Being designed for specific application domains, these approaches share commonalities as well as orthogonal solutions and can build the foundation of an overall event-driven spatial data infrastructure.","2442":"This conceptual paper deals ultimately with the intricate relationships existing between quantity and quality in the field of energy conservation policies. It discusses how current policy approaches to energy conservation have energy efficiency and individuals' behavioural change as principle target. It then argues that their limited impacts derive largely from how they are principally informed by quantitative estimates of reductions in energy inputs and neglect how qualitative changes generated in the energy outputs can either offset these reductions (e.g. more energy efficient motors can enable the production of larger cars consuming more energy) or cause higher savings (e.g. smaller cars can consume less energy even with less efficient motors). The paper also explains these limited impacts in terms of overly simplistic cause-effect relationships assumed to exist between given exogenous factors (e.g. provision of information, price signals, etc.) and individuals' behaviours. It then shows how radically alternative policies for energy conservation can target qualitative changes and re-organisations in energy outputs. In doing so, it takes social practice theories as theoretical background. Finally, it discusses the potentially very high impacts and the alternative character of policies informed by these theories and shows how and where they indicate to intervene.","2444":"This paper describes a fully spike-based neural network for optical flow estimation from dynamic vision sensor data. A low power embedded implementation of the method, which combines the asynchronous time-based image sensor with IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System, is presented. The sensor generates spikes with submillisecond resolution in response to scene illumination changes. These spike are processed by a spiking neural network running on TrueNorth with a 1-ms resolution to accurately determine the order and time difference of spikes from neighbouring pixels, and therefore infer the velocity. The spiking neural network is a variant of the Barlow Levick method for optical flow estimation. The system is evaluated on two recordings for which ground truth motion is available, and achieves an average endpoint error of 11% at an estimated power budget of under 80 mW for the sensor and computation.","2445":"Teamwork is an increasingly important aspect of knowledge production. In particular, factors influencing team formation relative to the composition of expertise are crucial for both organizational performance and for informing policy. In this paper, I draw attention to technology access as a highly influential factor impacting expertise in team formation. I examine the hack of Microsoft Kinect as an exogenous event that suddenly reduced motion-sensing technology costs. I show that great reductions in technology costs substitute for ex ante optimal involvement of area specialists and facilitate involvement of outside-area specialists through collaboration with researchers with broader knowledge- generalists. In other words, technology costs influence the composition of expertise in teamwork, with sufficiently large reductions leading to knowledge creation that combines more broadly across knowledge areas. These findings have important implications for organizations and policy makers in crafting incentives for more diverse knowledge creation through strategic investments that lower technology costs and influence team formation.","2448":"A computationally efficient approach to obtain vanishing points in images for camera orientation applications is presented in this paper. Modifications are made to the conventional J-linkage algorithm, named Fast J-linkage, so that the detection of vanishing points is achieved in a computationally efficient manner. This fast algorithm is then utilized to recover camera orientation or rotation matrices from video sequences. Both the computational efficiency and performance aspect of the Fast J-linkage algorithm are compared with the conventional J-linkage algorithm by examining the York Urban image database. In addition, the results of an actual camera rotation implementation is provided and validated by using inertial sensors data. The results obtained indicate the higher computational efficiency and accuracy aspects of the developed vanishing point detection.","2450":"Many Smart City projects are beginning to consider the role of citizens. However, current methods for engaging urban populations in participatory design (PD) activities are somewhat limited. In this article, we describe an approach taken to empower socially disadvantaged citizens, using a variety of both social and technological tools, in a Smart City project. Through analysing the nature of citizens' concerns and proposed solutions, we explore the benefits of our approach, arguing that engaging citizens can uncover hyper-local concerns that provide a foundation for finding solutions to address citizen concerns. By reflecting on our approach, we identify four key challenges to utilising PD at an urban scale; balancing scale with the personal, who has control of the process, who is participating and integrating citizen-led work with local authorities. By addressing these challenges, we will be able to truly engage citizens as collaborators in co-designing their city.","2451":"A novel moisture sensor based on near field communication (NFC) is presented. The system consists of a battery-less sensing device that measures temperature, relative humidity, and the volumetric water content, and is powered from the magnetic field generated by the reader. In order to compute the sensed data, the system includes a microcontroller, which has been programmed to make the calculations and to send the processed data to the NFC chip through an (IC)-C-2 bus. These data are stored into the EEPROM memory of the NFC-integrated circuit in NFC data exchange format, which is read by the reader. An analysis of different methods to measure the soil moisture is presented in order to select the approach, which fits better with the constraints of an NFC energy harvested system.","2452":"Velocity estimation is essential for multicopters to guarantee flight stability and maneuverability. For such a purpose, this paper proposes a new method for multicopter velocity estimation based on visual and inertial information in GPS-denied or confined environments. In this method, no map, artificial landmark of the environment is required, and only the off-the-shelf onboard sensors in a multicopter including a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a downward-looking monocular camera and an ultrasonic range finder facing downwards are exploited to constitute the vision motion constraint. This constraint connects metric velocity with the point correspondences between successive images in which an efficient approach based on Mean Shift (MS) algorithm is developed to detect outliers and select optimal matching points. Then, it is theoretically verified that the estimation system is observable based on observability analysis. Furthermore, combined with the vision motion constraint and a multicopter dynamic model, the metric velocity is estimated using a standard Linear Kalman Filter (LKF). Finally, the proposed method is tested with a collection of synthetic data from simulation as well as flight experiments using real data from Oil Matrice 100 and Guidance. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed method can accurately estimate the velocity of the multicopter in GPS-denied or confined environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Given the limited number of license-free industrial, scientific, and medical radio bands, wireless technologies end up competing with one another for the wireless spectrum. As such, the proper employment of medium access control (MAC) protocols is essential to guarantee efficient and reliable wireless communication. At the data link level, there has been extensive research toward programmable and more future-proof MAC protocols (e.g., software-defined radios (SDKs), which enable to reconfigure the entire protocol and hence access\/control fine-grained radio functionalities). However, actual deployments are so far limited because of performance issues and cost. With the increasing popularity of software-defined networking, also in the wireless domain, and the increasing performance of SDRs, we are evolving into a fully programmable data link layer. In this survey, we deliver: a landscape of the state-of-the-art on programmable MAC protocols; a coherent terminology that represents scope and level of programmability supported; an in-depth study of their advantages and disadvantages; and a discussion about future research challenges on MAC programmability. Many surveys have investigated the use of specific MAC protocols for a wide range of optimization criteria and application demands. This survey is the first that investigates the scope and the level of programmability that MAC protocols support.","2458":"The subglacial drainage system is one of the main controls on basal sliding, but remains only partially understood. Here we use an 8-year dataset of borehole observations on a small, alpine polythermal valley glacier in the Yukon Territory to assess qualitatively how well the established understanding of drainage physics explains the observed temporal evolution and spatial configuration of the drainage system. We find that the standard picture of a channelizing drainage system that evolves towards higher effective pressure explains many features of the dataset. However, our dataset underlines the importance of hydraulic isolation of parts of the bed. We observe how disconnected portions of the bed systematically grow towards the end of the summer season, causing the drainage system to fragment into progressively more distinct subsystems. We conclude with an adaptation of existing drainage models that aims to capture the ability of parts of the bed to become hydraulically disconnected due to basal cavities of finite size becoming disconnected from each other as they shrink.","2461":"Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl- ions based on the neuronal Cl- driving force. Established theories regarding the determinants of Cl- driving force have recently been questioned. Here, we present biophysical models of Cl- homeostasis using the pump-leak model. Using numerical and novel analytic solutions, we demonstrate that the Na+\/K+-ATPase, ion conductances, impermeant anions, electrodiffusion, water fluxes and cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play roles in setting the Cl- driving force. Our models, together with experimental validation, show that while impermeant anions can contribute to setting [Cl-](i) in neurons, they have a negligible effect on the driving force for Cl- locally and cell-wide. In contrast, we demonstrate that CCCs are well-suited for modulating Cl- driving force and hence inhibitory signaling in neurons. Our findings reconcile recent experimental findings and provide a framework for understanding the interplay of different chloride regulatory processes in neurons.","2462":"Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl- ions based on the neuronal Cl- driving force.

In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC\/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed\/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering\/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage.","2464":"Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W\/m(2). An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices.","2466":"This work develops an open hardware\/Software Test bench for solar tracker. The proposed prototype is based on a dual axis solar tracker controlled with Arduino Uno which is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. The solar tracker can be controlled automatically with the help of Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors or manually using a potentiometer. Moreover, this test bench provides a virtual instrumentation based on Excel in which its solar tracker data can be recorded and presented. The hardware used has been chosen to be inexpensive, compact and versatile. The proposed test bench enables large-scale solar tracker research, innovative new curriculum, and solar tracker outreach to younger students. A test of all its functionalities is done, the results show that it is flexible, easy to use. For instance, it can be used indoors using a lamp.","2470":null,"2473":"This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development. Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far.","2476":"In this work, a new approach for Sun tracking systems is presented. Due to the current system limitations regarding costs and operational problems, a new approach based on low cost, computer vision open hardware and deep learning has been developed. The preliminary tests carried out successfully in Plataforma solar de Almeria (PSA), reveal the great potential and show the new approach as a good alternative to traditional systems. The proposed approach can provide key variables for the Sun tracking system control like cloud movements prediction, block and shadow detection, atmospheric attenuation or measures of concentrated solar radiation, which can improve the control strategies of the system and therefore the system performance.

Here, we introduce the mesoscale selective plane-illumination microscopy initiative, an open-hardware project for building and operating a light-sheet microscope that addresses these challenges and is compatible with any type of cleared or expanded sample (www.mesospim.org).","2478":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines.","2484":"We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid\/liquid separator constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The separator - whose performance is competitive with far costlier commercial systems - is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for its firmware.","2485":"In low-income and developing countries, inadequate weather monitoring systems adversely affect the capacity of managing natural resources and related risks. Low-cost and IoT devices combined with a large diffusion of mobile connection and open technologies offer a possible solution to this problem. This research quantitatively evaluates the data quality of a non-conventional, low-cost and fully open system. The proposed novel solution was tested for a duration of 8 months, and the collected observations were compared with a nearby authoritative weather station. The experimental weather station is based in Arduino and transmits data through the 2G General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) to the istSOS which is a software to set-up a web service to collect, share and manage observations from sensor networks using the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The results demonstrated that this accessible solution produces data of appropriate quality for natural resource and risk management.","2486":"This paper characterizes and explores a corporate strategy in which downstream firms collaborate to develop open substitute designs for proprietary hardware they would otherwise purchase from upstream suppliers. This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design\/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This \"scale-stealing\" mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.","2487":"The ubiquitous nature and great potential of Wireless Sensors Network has not yet been fully exploited in automotive applications. This work deals with the choice of the cost-effective hardware required to face the challenges and issues proposed by the new trend in the development of intelligent transportation systems. With this aim, a preliminary WSN architecture is proposed. Several commercially available open-source platforms are compared and the Raspberry Pi stood out as a suitable and viable solution. The sensing layer is designed with two goals. Firstly, accelerometric, temperature, and relative humidity sensors were integrated on a dedicated PCB to test if mechanical or environmental stresses during bus rides could be harmful to the device or to its performances. The physical quantities are monitored automatically to alert the driver, thus improving the quality of service. Then, the rationale and functioning of the management and service layer is presented. The proposed cost-effective WSN node was employed and tested to transmit messages and videos, while investigating if any quantitative relationship exists between these operations and the environmental and operative conditions experienced by the hardware.","2492":"Open-source technology for supporting the Industry 4.0 has become the target of academic research in many sectors. This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors.","2496":"This work copes with the design and implementation of a wireless sensors network architecture to automatically and continuously monitor, for the first time, the manufacturing process of Sardinian Carasau bread. The case of a traditional bakery company facing the challenge of the Food-Industry 4.0 competitiveness is investigated. The process was analyzed to identify the most relevant variables to be monitored during the product manufacturing. Then, a heterogeneous, multi-tier wireless sensors network was designed and realized to allow the real-time control and the data collection during the critical steps of dough production, sheeting, cutting and leavening. Commercial on-the-shelf and cost-effective integrated electronics were employed, making the proposed approach of interest for many practical cases. Finally, a user-friendly interface was provided to enhance the understanding, control and to favor the process monitoring. With the wireless senors network (WSN) we designed, it is possible to monitor environmental parameters (temperature, relative humidity, gas concentrations); cinematic quantities of the belts; and, through a dedicated image processing system, the morphological characteristics of the bread before the baking. The functioning of the WSN was demonstrated and a statistical analysis was performed on the variables monitored during different seasons.","2499":"The Segura River Basin (SRB), located in the South East of Spain, has the lowest percentage of renewable water resources of all the Spanish basins. Therefore, knowledge of the annual rate of water reservoir sedimentation is an important issue to be resolved in one of the most water-stressed regions in the western Mediterranean basin. This paper describes the sensors developed in collaboration with technology-based enterprises (aerial drone, floating drone, and underwater drone), and the methodology for integration of the different types of data acquired to monitor the reservoirs of the SRB. The proposed solution was applied to 21 reservoirs of the SRB. The proposed methodology is based on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for photogrammetry of the reservoir surface area. For each reservoir, two flights were completed, with 20 cm and 5 cm resolution, respectively. Then, a triangular irregular network mesh was generated by GIS techniques. Surface water vehicles (USV) and underwater remote-operated vehicles (ROV) were used to undertake bathymetric surveys. In addition, water quality measurements were made with an ROV device. The main results consist of topographic and bathymetric measurements for each reservoir, obtained by using equipment based on OpenSource technology. According to the results, the annual rate of storage capacity loss of water resources in the SRB ' s reservoirs is 0.33%.","2501":"In the past years, multiple research projects have explored the potential of low-cost environmental sensors for urban air pollution monitoring. However, each project has taken its own independent and in many cases, fully or partially closed approach. We present the Smart Citizen System, a flexible, easy-to-use and fully open-source environmental monitoring solution for particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, noise levels, and many other indicators. The use of low-cost sensors in recent years has been generally approached in two different ways citizen science and educational activities, where the primary purpose is to engage citizens in the measurement process and raise awareness of environmental concerns; and a more sophisticated scientific approach, where the main aim is to study the potentiality of the low-cost sensing technologies. The Smart Citizen System balances modularity with integration to fulfil both needs by providing an extendable solution, with different ranges of sensors based on the same core components. With that aim, two solutions have been developed: the Smart Citizen Kit, intended for citizen science and awareness activities; and the Smart Citizen Station, designed to serve as a more complex and accurate set of air pollution sensors. The design is based on the principle of reproducibility, also integrating non-hardware components such as a dedicated storage platform and a sensor analysis framework. The core system bases its sensing capabilities in widely reviewed low-cost sensors and aims to provide a robust framework for environmental monitoring activities. By making everything open, from the hardware to the software platform or the sensor post-processing algorithms, we hope others might find it useful as a development platform allowing them to focus on their project particular needs instead of reinventing everything from the ground-up.

Mobility issues (or Smart Mobility) are one of the main components of Smart Cities. Bicycles, as a transport component in the cities, are on the rise all over the world. At least, it is true for all areas where the climate even minimally allows it. The reasons are quite obvious. This is democratic and accessible this type of transport, it is cheap and environmental friendliness. Of course, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle also plays its role. The development of this type of transport (like any other) has many different aspects. In this paper, we dwell on the issues of tracking the movement of cyclists and planning bike-sharing systems.

To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored.

It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building.","2511":"The Internet-of-Things (IoT) revolution has shaped a new application domain where low-power RISC architectures constitute the standard computational backbone. The current de-facto design practice for such architectures is to extend the ISA and the corresponding microarchitecture with custom instructions to efficiently manage the complex tasks imposed by IoT applications, i.e., augmented reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, within narrow energy and area budgets. However, the new IoT application domain also offers a unique opportunity to revisit and optimize the RISC microarchitectural design flow from a more communication- and memory-centric viewpoint. This manuscript critically explores and optimizes the design of a RISC CPU front-end for IoT delivering a two-fold objective: (i) provide an optimized CPU microarchitecture; and (ii) present a set of three design guidelines to steer the implementation of IoT CPUs. The exploration sits on a newly proposed Systems-on-Chip (SoC) and RISC CPU implementing the RISC-V\/IMF ISA and accounting for area, timing, and performance design metrics. Such SoC offers a reference design to evaluate pros and cons of different microarchitectural solutions. A wide combination of microarchitectures considering different branch prediction schemes, cache design architectures and on-chip bus solutions have been evaluated. The entire exploration is focused on the FPGA-based implementation due to the renewed interest for this technology demonstrated by both the research community and companies.

Training tools that provide hands-on experience on GCPVSs, allowing the measurement of important parameters in this application, are significant sources of dissemination of this technology. In this context, a mobile, cost-effective, training tool, known as GCPVS-MT (GCPVS-Mobile Trainer), has been developed with the purpose of assisting in training courses, academic activities and disseminating the application. This paper describes the design of the tool and discusses its utilization, providing examples of its usage in measuring important characteristics of a GCPVS.

The C-Dots are synthesized from gelatin using a hydrothermal route and have amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups on the surface. Because of these functionalities, the C-Dots are directly coordinated to the highly reactive -NO2 and -NH groups of imidacloprid with a high binding affinity (3.24 x 10(6)) and selectivity, which switches the C-Dots to the more isolated state than its initial non-isolated state resulting in an enhancement of the C-Dots' fluorescence (turn-on). In contrast, to the other four pesticides, the fluorescence of the C-Dots gets quenched (turn-off). The pesticide-C-Dot interactions are mainly a static type via a ground state non-fluorescent complex formation with an insignificant contribution from the diffusion controlled electron transfer reaction. The as-fabricated C-Dots display different binding characteristics with the different pesticides which are helpful in distinguishing the target pesticides with very low detection limits of 0.013 mu M for imidacloprid and 0.04 mu M for tetradifon which are comparable to the previously reported values. The results of time-resolved fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy experiments support the results. In addition, the electrochemical detection approach confirmed the findings. The recovery efficiency of 92-97%, in real river water suggested that the fabricated nanoprobe would be a good, useable sensor in practical applications. Thus, the current investigation is helpful for designing a new, easy, eco-friendly, and efficient sensing method for pesticide monitoring.","2515":"Hackathons are techno-creative events during which participants get together in a physical location. They may be hosted by civic communities, corporations or public institutions. Working individually or in teams, usually for several days, participants develop projects such as hardware or software prototypes. Based on a digital ethnography of two events in the Netherlands and Denmark, this article investigates project development practices at hackathons. In particular, it analyses how participants organized their project work and which technologies were used in support of their creative endeavours. Hackathons are increasingly competitive rather than collaborative events, involving time pressure, inducements such as prizes, and requiring efficient skills utilization. I argue that this facilitates the following tendencies: Firstly, strategic effort is put into final presentations. Projects need to be convincingly presented, and persuasively pitching an idea becomes crucial. Secondly, there is only limited time for personal learning, since participants' existing skills need to be efficiently applied if a team wants to stay competitive. This encourages division of labour within groups: a tendency which seems especially problematic given that IT skills biases are often expressed in terms of gender. Thirdly, participants are more inclined to use technologies that are proprietary but appear 'open enough'. In light of this observation and by drawing on the concept of technology as resource and opportunity, I discuss the techno-political implications of utilized technologies. With this analysis, I aim at contributing to the critical debate on hackathons as productive but likewise ideologically significant fields of 'hacking cultures'.","2516":"A line-of-sight stabilised sighting system, capable of target tracking and video stabilisation is a prime requirement of any armoured fighting tank vehicle for military surveillance and weapon firing. Typically, such sighting systems have three prime electro-optical sensors i.e. day camera for viewing in day conditions, thermal camera for night viewing and eye-safe laser range finder for obtaining the target range. For laser guided missile firing, additional laser target designator may be a part of sighting system. This sighting system provides necessary parameters for the fire control computer to compute ballistic offsets to fire conventional ammunition or fire missile. System demands simultaneous interactions with electro-optical sensors, servo sensors, actuators, multi-function display for man-machine interface, fire control computer, logic controller and other sub-systems of tank. Therefore, a complex embedded electronics hardware is needed to respond in real time for such system. An efficient electronics embedded hardware architecture is presented here for the development of this type of sighting system. This hardware has been developed around SHARC 21369 processor and FPGA. A performance evaluation scheme is also presented for this sighting system based on the developed hardware.","2517":"The housing crisis has received growing interest from academia, industry, and policymakers. Open construction systems have emerged as a promising solution to achieve long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability. In this paper, extensive fieldwork was conducted to investigate a case of an open construction system, namely, the WikiHouse Den Bosch. The research framework builds on a combined view of two main concepts: conviviality and openness. The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two aspects and the literature regarding Design Global Manufacture Local. The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and context-specific factors. The paper concludes by outlining the need for an institutionalized conviviality to open up new pathways for future practice to address sustainability issues.","2518":"The three-dimensional imaging of mesoscopic samples with Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) has become a powerful tool for biomedical phenotyping studies. OPT uses visible light to visualize the 3D morphology of large transparent samples. To enable a wider application of OPT, we present OptiJ, a low-cost, fully open-source OPT system capable of imaging large transparent specimens up to 13 mm tall and 8 mm deep with 50 mu m resolution. OptiJ is based on off-the-shelf, easy-to-assemble optical components and an ImageJ plugin library for OPT data reconstruction. The software includes novel correction routines for uneven illumination and sample jitter in addition to CPU\/GPU accelerated reconstruction for large datasets. We demonstrate the use of OptiJ to image and reconstruct cleared lung lobes from adult mice. We provide a detailed set of instructions to set up and use the OptiJ framework. Our hardware and software design are modular and easy to implement, allowing for further open microscopy developments for imaging large organ samples.","2520":"This study addresses the design of smart sensor system aided bicycle that can be exploited as a platform for the acquisition of real-time data. In particular, in this work, the authors address the pressing issues like air pollution monitoring and health monitoring by using sensors that were seen as limitations in the already existing smart e-bike monitoring system. The sensor system presented in this study is capable of monitoring parameters such as location, heart rate of the rider and air quality levels in real-time. The data thus collected is fed into Thingspeak, an open Internet of Things platform powered by Matlab. The data is then visually represented in an Android application for riders to view and analyse the monitored parameters. The Android application designed for the system assists the user with location tracking, pollution mapping and health monitoring. Furthermore, security is also considered in this work which is addressed with the help of a fingerprint sensor and a global system for mobile\/global positioning system module to alert the user in case of system theft. The system attached to the bicycle can be implemented on a large scale as a fleet\/bike sharing system in order to map the pollution of an entire city with the help of IoT, thus aiding the development of greenfield smart city and additionally monitoring the vitals of the user riding the bicycle leading to intelligent transportation system. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, enlists the outcomes of the system and explores the future scope and development.","2524":"The fast evolution of technologies forces teachers to trade content off for self-learning. Project-based learning (PBL) is one of the best ways to promote self-learning and simultaneously boost motivation. In this paper, we present our experience of designing a PBL course for industrial informatics. We provide all the designing details that could help other teachers to reproduce a similar experience. Furthermore, we report on the impact that this project has on student satisfaction and motivation. The new industry 4.0 topic allows us to carry out complete projects, integrating different technologies and tools. Moreover, the selection of open-source and standard free technologies makes easy and cheap the access to hardware and software platforms used. Surveys taught us that tuning the courses toward developing real projects on the field, has a large impact on acceptance, learning objectives achievements, and motivation toward the course content.","2526":"This paper presents design details adopting open embedded systems (OES) as real-time controllers in industrial distributed control systems. OES minimize development cost and enhance portability while addressing widely known shortcomings of their proprietary counterparts. These shortcomings include the black box method of distribution which hinders integration to more complex systems. However, OES are highly dependent on the compatibility of each software components and essential benchmarking is required to ensure that the system can satisfy hard real-time constraints. To address these issues and the notion that OES will find broader distributed control applications, we provide detailed procedures in realizing OES based on an open source real-time operating system on various low-cost open embedded platforms. Their performance was evaluated and compared in terms of periodicity and schedulability, task synchronization, and interrupt response time, which are crucial metrics to determine stability and reliability of real-time controllers. Practical implementations, including the modernization of a multi-axis industrial robot controller, are described clearly to serve as a comprehensive reference on the integration of OES in industrial distributed control systems.","2528":"An increasing number of implementations of IoT for development use the LoRaWAN protocol as many of them leverage the free network and application servers provided by The Things Networks (TTN) to fulfill their needs. Unfortunately, in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, Internet access cannot be taken for granted, therefore, TTN might not be available. Moreover, low-cost and low-power consumption options devices are the most sustainable ones. In this paper, we propose a LoRaWAN network with autonomous base stations that can work without Internet connectivity for essential services, while being able to provide additional features whenever Internet access becomes available, even in an intermittent fashion. Security and privacy are preserved, with support for mobile nodes.","2530":"Using breakout physical computing toolkits, such as Arduino, has become a common practice of both engineers and non-engineers alike. While these development platforms solve many low-level challenges, getting started with embedded system prototyping may seem overwhelming for novices. Choosing novice friendly sensors can make a substantial difference. In this paper, a framework for selecting sensors for novice use is presented and accessibility obstacles are defined. Six learning barriers in end-user programming are adopted for evaluating obstacles effecting on novice usability. Four properties for evaluating sensors and to overcome the barriers are presented: protocol complexity, connection type and component size, understandable real-life phenomena measured and documentation. Sensor protocol complexity and documentation are identified as key factors affecting implementation challenges.","2531":"This paper proposes a real-time (RT) control architecture based on Xenomai, an RT embedded Linux, to control a service robot along with non-real-time (NRT) robot operating system (ROS) packages. Most software, including device drivers and ROS, are developed to operate under the standard Linux kernel that does not provide RT guarantees. Standard Linux system calls in an RT context stimulates mode switching, resulting in non-deterministic responses and stability problems such as priority inversion and kernel panic. This paper overcomes such issues through a communication interface between RT and NRT tasks, termed cross-domain datagram protocol. The proposed architecture supports priority-based scheduling of multiple tasks while exposing an interface compatible with the original ROS packages. Moreover, it enables standard device driver operation inside RT tasks without developing RT device drivers that requires significant amount of development time. Feasibility is proven by Raspberry Pi 3, a low-cost open embedded hardware platform, and conducted various experiments to analyze its performance and applied it to a service robot using ROS navigation packages. The results indicate that the proposed architecture can effectively provide an RT environment without stability issues when utilizing ROS packages and standard device drivers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It provides timed stimulus presentation, interfacing with external devices and simultaneous real-time tracking of behavioral parameters such as position, orientation, tail and eye motion in both freely-swimming and head-restrained preparations. Stytra logs all recorded quantities, metadata, and code version in standardized formats to allow full provenance tracking, from data acquisition through analysis to publication. The package is modular and expandable for different experimental protocols and setups. Current releases can be found at https:\/\/github.com\/portugueslab\/stytra. We also provide complete documentation with examples for extending the package to new stimuli and hardware, as well as a schema and parts list for behavioral setups. We showcase Stytra by reproducing previously published behavioral protocols in both head-restrained and freely-swimming larvae. We also demonstrate the use of the software in the context of a calcium imaging experiment, where it interfaces with other acquisition devices. Our aims are to enable more laboratories to easily implement behavioral experiments, as well as to provide a platform for sharing stimulus protocols that permits easy reproduction of experiments and straightforward validation. Finally, we demonstrate how Stytra can serve as a platform to design behavioral experiments involving tracking or visual stimulation with other animals and provide an example integration with the DeepLabCut neural network-based tracking method.","2534":"This paper describes the development of a new method to control the camera arm of a surgical robot and create a better sense of remote presence for the surgeon. The current surgical systems are entirely controlled by the surgeon, using hand controllers and foot pedals to manipulate either the instrument or the camera arms. The surgeon must pause the operation to move the camera arm to obtain a desired view and then resume the operation. The camera and tools cannot be moved simultaneously, leading to interrupted and unnatural movements. These interruptions can lead to medical errors and extended operation times. In our system, the surgeon controls the camera arm by his natural head movements while being immersed in a 3D-stereo view of the scene with a head-mounted display (HMD). The novel approach enables the camera arm to be maneuvered based on sensors of the HMD. We implemented this method on a da Vinci Standard Surgical System using the HTC Vive headset along with the Unity engine and the Robot Operating System framework. This paper includes the result of a subjective six-participant usability study that compares the workload of the traditional clutched camera control method against the HMD-based control. Initial results indicate that the system is usable, stable, and has a lower physical and mental workload when using the HMD control method.","2535":"Internet-of-Things (IoT) is an enabling technology for numerous initiatives worldwide such as manufacturing, smart cities, precision agriculture, and eHealth. The massive field data aggregation of distributed administered IoT devices allows new insights and actionable information for dynamic intelligent decision-making. In such distributed environments, data integrity, referring to reliability and consistency, is deemed insufficient and requires immediate facilitation. In this article, we introduce a distributed ledger (DLT)-based system for ensuring IoT data integrity which securely processes the aggregated field data. Its uniqueness lies in the embedded use of IOTA's ledger, called \"The Tangle\", used to transmit and store the data. Our approach shifts from a cloud-centric IoT system, where the Super nodes simply aggregate and push data to the cloud, to a node-centric system, where each Super node owns the data pushed in a distributed and decentralized database (i.e., the Tangle). The backend serves as a consumer of data and a provider of additional resources, such as administration panel, analytics, data marketplace, etc. The proposed implementation is highly modularand constitutes a significant contribution to the Open Source communities, regarding blockchain and IoT.","2536":"Soil moisture is a vital component for plant growth. There are many electro-chemical low-cost sensors that sense soil moisture with immediate effect rather than other methods such as gravimetric method and others that are expensive as well as consume lot of time. Some of these electro-chemical sensors work on resistivity whereas some sensors work on capacitance. This paper compares the efficiency of resistivity-based sensors with capacitance-based soil moisture sensors so that farmers and experts can use the better one for designing IoT-based irrigation monitoring and controller system. This comparison is performed with 21 samples having different levels of soil water content. The coefficient of variation is calculated to compare the efficiency of both the sensors. After the comparison, calibration has also been performed that depicts the soil moisture content to LCD display and alert the farmer by a buzzer.","2538":"HCI recognizes the importance of visions as both a design and futuring approach and a problem-solving technique. One challenge of visioning work is who can propose and shape IT visions and how they can achieve the widespread buy-in needed to make them efficacious. In this paper, we focus on the potential of making, open design, and open manufacturing for contributing toward, if not fully achieving, the broadening of participation in IT envisioning. We use Taiwan's MakerPro, a manufacturers and IT R&D community as a case to unpack what collective IT visioning looks like, how it shapes IT agendas concretely, and the implications for open design\/open manufacturing research agenda in HCI. Our findings reveal how MakerPro members constructed and developed visions for open design and open manufacturing in Taiwan, obstacles to such visions, and how these obstacles can be collaboratively overcome through a participative and even democratic process. We also show that the collective purposiveness not only defines a regional vision agenda but also embraces an entire nation's future.","2539":"The design of wireless sensor nodes for animal tracking is a multidisciplinary activity that presents several research challenges both from a technical and a biological point of view. A monitoring device has to be designed accounting for all system requirements including the specific characteristics of animals and environment. In this work we present some aspects of the design of a wireless sensor node to track and monitor the pink iguana of the Galapagos: a recently discovered species living in remote locations at the Galapagos Islands. The few individuals of this species live in a relatively small area that lacks of any available communication infrastructure. We present and discuss the energy harvesting architecture and the related energy management logic. We also discuss the impact of packaging on the sensor performance and the consequences of the limited available energy on the GPS tracking.","2540":"In order to accelerate deployment of distributed recycling by providing low-cost feed stocks of granulated post-consumer waste plastic, this study analyzes an open source waste plastic granulator system. It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle\/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business-based distributed recycling.","2541":"Microcontrollers and single-board computers are widespread tools for innovative educational labs, for prototyping and for accomplish everyday tasks by expert users. Moreover, these modules are opening new exciting possibilities in the area of biological and chemical assays. In this study a Raspberry Pi computer assembled with 3D printed parts and inexpensive opto-electronic components were employed to analyse the antioxidant capacity of several bottled tea performing diphenylpicryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) tests. A dedicated python software allowed the execution of the analysis controlling the device through a small LCD touch screen or remotely through secure connections with other devices. The Raspberry Pi-based measurements were compared with a research-grade spectrophotometer showing excellent correlation (R2 = 0.9996) and no significant differences (p < 0.05) in the range of measured values. We strongly believe that this approach could support diagnostics progress in resourcepoor countries and open new opportunities in research and education.","2542":"Affordable and physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) cell-based assays used in high-throughput screening (HTS) are on the rise in early drug discovery. These technologies have been aided by the recent adaptation of novel microplate treatments and spheroid culturing techniques. One such technology involves the use of nanoparticle (NanoShuttle-PL) labeled cells and custom magnetic drives to assist in cell aggregation to ensure rapid 3D structure formation after the cells have been dispensed into microtiter plates. Transitioning this technology from a low-throughput manual benchtop application, as previously published by our lab, into a robotically enabled format achieves orders of magnitude greater throughput but required the development of specialized support hardware. This effort included in-house development, fabrication, and testing of ancillary devices that assist robotic handing and high-precision placement of microtiter plates into an incubator embedded with magnetic drives. Utilizing a \"rapid prototyping\" approach facilitated by cloud-based computer-aided design software, we built the necessary components using hobby-grade 3D printers with turnaround times that rival those of traditional manufacturing\/development practices at a substantially reduced cost. This approach culminated in a first-in-class HTS-compatible 3D system in which we have coupled 3D bioprinting to a fully automated HTS robotic platform utilizing our novel magnetic incubator shelf assemblies.","2546":"The poseidon syringe pump and microscope system is an open source alternative to commercial systems. It costs less than $400 and can be assembled in under an hour using the instructions and source files available at https:\/\/pachterlab.github.io\/poseidon.

The principles are functionality, robustness, safety, simplicity, modularity, benchmarking, and documentation.","2547":"This paper presents a smart e-nose device to monitor indoor hazardous air. Indoor hazardous odor is a threat for seniors, infants, children, pregnant women, disabled residents, and patients. To overcome the limitations of using existing non-intelligent, slow-responding, deficient gas sensors, we propose a novel artificial-intelligent-based multiple hazard gas detector (MHGD) system that is mounted on a motor vehicle-based robot which can be remotely controlled. First, we optimized the sensor array for the classification of three hazardous gases, including cigarette smoke, inflammable ethanol, and off-flavor from spoiled food, using an e-nose with a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber can prevent the impact of environmental changes. We compared the classification results of all combinations of sensors, and selected the one with the highest accuracy (98.88%) as the optimal sensor array for the MHGD. The optimal sensor array was then mounted on the MHGD to detect and classify the target gases without a mixing chamber but in a controlled environment. Finally, we tested the MHGD under these conditions, and achieved an acceptable accuracy (70.00%).","2548":"A new digital instrument for timing of events is presented. It is based on a reconfigurable, high-performance, 16-channel time-to-digital converter implemented in a Xilinx 7 Series 28-nm field programmable gate array device. Each channel provides timestamps with a least significant bit of 2 ps that states the resolution, whereas instead the single-shot precision is below 12.5 ps rms with the possibility of multihit measures at the maximum rate of 20 MHz. The default width of the full-scale range is 157 mu s that can be extended at users choosing up to 15 days by means of proper time tagging procedures made available. The instrument achieves performance in terms of precision, resolution, and full-scale range of measurement at the state-of-art of existing solutions. The novelty is that besides performance, the presented instrument is totally reconfigurable by the user both in the hardware and in the firmware parts. Moreover, novel techniques of event acquisition (e.g., level-zero trigger) are introduced. These further features are not present in any other instrument available nor in the literature or in commerce and constitute a difference with respect to all referenced instruments.

In this work, the attitude and position control challenges for a drone with a package connected by a wire is analysed. During the delivering task, it is very difficult to eliminate the external unpredictable disturbances. A robust neural network-based backstepping sliding mode control method is designed, which is capable of monitoring the drone's flight path and desired attitude with a suspended cable attached. The convergence of the position and attitude errors together with the Lyapunov function are employed to attest to the robustness of the nonlinear transportation platform. The proposed control system is tested with a simulation and in an outdoor environment. The simulation and open field test results for the UAV transportation platform verify the controllers' reliability.","2552":"Contrary to the corporate production of digital cities, shared technology making explores ways of innovation that are open to all, informed by diverse knowledges, and led by citizens. However, this exploration faces corporate translation of ethical and societal values for capital accumulation and concerns around the right to participate. Building on Tsing's concept of 'ruins', this paper considers the anticipation of digital futures while the neoliberal ruination of shared technology making is in full swing. The paper examines the entanglements in hackathon rationalities and practices and demonstrates that the possibilities of shared technology making emerge from disrupting technocratic visions and repurposing corporate innovation resources and techniques. Drawing on the analysis, the paper argues that these entanglements are crucial to digital futures. They disclose in concrete ways how neoliberal co-optation can be disturbed and transformed. Equally importantly, they urge continuous explorations to assemble diverse practices and values for building momentum towards sustained processes of shaping desirable futures.","2553":"Nineteen million Americans have significant vision loss. Over 70% of these are not employed full-time, and more than a quarter live below the poverty line. Globally, there are 36 million blind people, but less than half use white canes or more costly commercial sensory substitutions. The quality of life for visually impaired people is hampered by the resultant lack of independence. To help alleviate these challenges this study reports on the development of a low-cost, open-source ultrasound-based navigational support system in the form of a wearable bracelet to allow people with the lost vision to navigate, orient themselves in their surroundings and avoid obstacles when moving. The system can be largely made with digitally distributed manufacturing using low-cost 3-D printing\/milling. It conveys point-distance information by utilizing the natural active sensing approach and modulates measurements into haptic feedback with various vibration patterns within the four-meter range. It does not require complex calibrations and training, consists of the small number of available and inexpensive components, and can be used as an independent addition to traditional tools. Sighted blindfolded participants successfully demonstrated the device for nine primary everyday navigation and guidance tasks including indoor and outdoor navigation and avoiding collisions with other pedestrians.","2554":"The convergence of operational and information technologies in the industry requires a new generation of IP-compliant communication protocols that can meet the industrial performance requirements while facilitating the integration with novel web-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. For more than a decade, the industry has relied on time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) communication technology to meet these performance requirements through standards such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a. TSCH-based networks have proven to yield over 99.999% end-to-end reliability, supporting flow isolation and QoS management while ensuring over a decade of battery lifetime. However, these technologies were designed to address the factory use cases of a decade ago, not considering IP compliance or standardized network management and resource orchestration as a must. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the 6TiSCH working group (WG) have been actively working on this challenge by designing protocols to bridge the performance of industrial solutions with IP-compliant networks. The effort has resulted in 6TiSCH, a set of specifications that define the IPv6 control plane to manage and orchestrate a TSCH network. 6TiSCH provides the missing elements for zero-configuration TSCH network bootstrap, efficient network access authentication, and distributed and modular scheduling mechanisms. As a cross-layer effort, 6TiSCH leverages and integrates other IETF specifications and the WG has also driven the definition of novel specifications in other IETF WGs. An ultimate goal of this effort is the definition of a fully functional architecture where a combination of IETF protocols enables the envisioned convergence on top of the IEEE industrial standard. This paper introduces the work done by the 6TiSCH WG at IETF, evaluates the performance of the reference implementation, and discusses the 6TiSCH software ecosystem.","2556":"The increasing development of urban centers brings serious challenges for traffic management. In this paper, we introduce a smart visual sensor, developed for a pilot project taking place in the Australian city of Liverpool (NSW). The project's aim was to design and evaluate an edge-computing device using computer vision and deep neural networks to track in real-time multi-modal transportation while ensuring citizens' privacy. The performance of the sensor was evaluated on a town center dataset. We also introduce the interoperable Agnosticity framework designed to collect, store and access data from multiple sensors, with results from two real-world experiments.","2558":"The Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County implemented a project to improve irrigation management through providing field assistance to growers. A web-based decision support tool called CropManage (https:\/\/v3.cropmanage.ucanr.edu) developed by the University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE) of Monterey County aids growers with irrigation scheduling. However, CropManage requires a flowmeter and a monitoring station to track water use in the field. In this article, we describe a device that was conceived as a low-cost alternative to Campbell Scientific flowmeter-monitoring stations that include data logger, modem, enclosure, battery, solar panel and charge regulator and cost above $2000. The device was designed for low-cost, ease of construction and with the capability of emulating the Campbell Scientific equipment functions and outputs. The devices were enabled with FTP communication to a central FTP server and were built with an Arduino MEGA, an Adafruit Datalogging Shield and an Adafruit FONA cellular modem. A voltage divider was added to monitor the external 12 V battery voltage and a DC\/DC converter was used to convert 12 V to 5 V. Each field station, including the device, battery, enclosure and solar panel has a total cost below $300, while the FTP server costs less than $100. The device was tested for two years in filed conditions and gave output equivalent to the Campbell Scientific equipment. The device is a low-cost technology that enables growers to gain access to CropManage cheaply and reliably.

This is problematic in inaccessible or hazardous field environments, including highly crevassed glaciers, where implementing suitable GCP networks would be logistically difficult if not impossible. To overcome this challenge, we present an alternative geolocation approach known as GNSS-supported aerial triangulation (GNSS-AT). Here, an on-board carrier-phase GNSS receiver is used to determine the location of photo acquisitions using kinematic differential carrier-phase positioning. The camera positions can be used as the geospatial input to the photogrammetry process. We describe the implementation of this method in a low-cost, custom-built UAV and apply the method in a glaciological setting at Store Glacier in western Greenland. We validate the technique at the calving front, achieving topographic uncertainties of +\/- 0.12 m horizontally (similar to 1.1 x the ground sampling distance) and +\/- 0.14 m vertically (similar to 1.3 x the ground sampling distance), when flying at an altitude of similar to 450 m above ground level. This compares favourably with previous GCP-derived uncertainties in glacial environments and allows us to apply the SfM-MVS photogrammetry at an inland study site where ice flows at 2 m day(-1) and stable ground control is not available. Here, we were able to produce, without the use of GCPs, the first UAV-derived velocity fields of an ice sheet interior. Given the growing use of UAVs and SfM-MVS in glaciology and the geosciences, GNSS-AT will be of interest to those wishing to use UAV photogrammetry to obtain high-precision measurements of topographic change in contexts where GCP collection is logistically constrained.","2563":"The article explores the concept of openness in the design field. In particular, it suggests a broad interpretation of the relationship between openness and design by analyzing the use of the expression open design between 2000 and 2017. This expression is related to words such as, co-design, crowdsourcing, open innovation, making and open manufacturing, which can be synthesized by the concepts of open source, collaboration, and access. The article finally expresses, through a critical point of view, the reasons why open processes in design have limitations.","2564":"In western countries, robotics is becoming increasingly common in primary and secondary education, both as a specific discipline and a tool to make science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects more appealing to children. The impact of robotics on society is also growing yearly, with new robotics applications in such things as autonomous cars, vacuum cleaners, and the area of logistics. In addition, the labor market is constantly demanding more professionals with robotics skills. This paper presents the PyBoKids framework for teaching robotics in secondary school, where its aim is to improve pre-university robotics education. It is based on the Python programming language and robots using an Arduino microprocessor. It includes a software infrastructure and a collection of practical exercises directed at pre-university students. The software infrastructure provides support for real and simulated robots. Moreover, we describe a pilot teaching project based on this framework, which was used by more than 2000 real students over the last two years.","2565":"The fast evolution of technologies forces teachers to trade content off for self-learning.

The maker mindset summarizes the ideology of the maker movement-a set of values predicated on making, sharing, learning and playing. Through a critical review of research and practices of makerspaces in the U.S., Singapore, China and Ghana, this paper explores the respective national discourses surrounding the maker movement and maker education. By revealing some of the ways that the values have been embraced, reinterpreted, remixed or rejected as the movement has gained global momentum, this paper intends to establish a greater appreciation for the diversity and complexity of the maker movement and maker education in the global context. Ultimately, this complex, multifaceted remixing reveals a deeper understanding of why the movement has been or may be embraced by diverse nations across the globe.","2570":"This paper presents the design, implementation, and testing of a soft landing gear together with a neural network-based control method for replicating avian landing behavior on non-flat surfaces. With full consideration of unmanned aerial vehicles and landing gear requirements, a quadrotor helicopter, comprised of one flying unit and one landing assistance unit, is employed. Considering the touchdown speed and posture, a novel design of a soft mechanism for non-flat surfaces is proposed, in order to absorb the remaining landing impact. The framework of the control strategy is designed based on a derived dynamic model. A neural network-based backstepping controller is applied to achieve the desired trajectory. The simulation and outdoor testing results attest to the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control method.","2573":"Edge computing is a continuum that includes the computing resources from cloud to things. Ecosystem of things (EoT) is a subsystem of the ecosystem of edge computing, which potentially contains trillions of devices of things and directly interacts with the physical world. This paper surveys the state of the art of EoT by focusing on the computing infrastructure aspect with a forward-looking perspective. We point out a trend of smart edge computing with four types of smartness and intelligence. We address three fundamental questions. 1) What capabilities and how much energy efficiency are the hardware providing? What is the future growth potential? 2) What abstractions are provided by the system software? Are they adequate to support smart edge computing? 3) What ecosystem architectures have been proposed for the coordination of things, the edge, and the cloud? Are they meeting the needs to encourage innovation but avoid unnecessary ecosystem fragmentation? We examine advances from both industry and academia, including research results, visions, and project concepts. We also point out future research directions.","2576":"Maintenance of water resources through collection of water followed by laboratory analysis, is a key factor in the measurement of water quality. The main difficulty for water collection and analysis is the logistics of the process, since the collections are often made by mall boats in very distant aquifers, applying manual processes, and are sometimes based on few samples. In this paper, the development, construction, and implementation of a robotic airboat to measure water quality in lakes has been described. The airboat was developed in the form of a mini-boat, in a fiberglass structure, whose interior housed a battery, a Raspberry Pi mini-computer, a Wi-Fi router for connection to a notebook, tablet or cell phone, and sensors connected to the Arduino platform. The airboat was validated in two lagoons in Fortaleza, and in a reservoir in the city of Pacatuba. The results were collected with the purpose of analyzing the parameters of each lagoon. The main contribution of this work was the development of an autonomous system of acquiring water parameters from several points of the lagoon.","2578":"Stereolithography is a 3D printing technique in which a liquid monomer is photopolymerized to produce a solid object. The most widely used materials usually belong to the family of acrylate monomers, and photopolymerization occurs through a radical pathway. Photoinitiators can absorb UV or (less often) visible light, producing radicals for direct decomposition or hydrogen abstraction. Due to the toxicity of acrylates, vegetable oil-derived monomers were used in this study. In fact, vegetable oils contain unsaturations, and thus, they can be exploited as monomers. In particular, linseed oil, tung oil or edible oils (soybean, sunflower or corn) could be good candidates as raw materials. Unfortunately, the photoinduced radical polymerization of these oils either does not occur or is too slow for 3D printing applications. For this reason, the oils were modified as epoxides. Epoxides are monomers that are more reactive than natural oils, and they can be polymerized via a cationic mechanism. The aim of this work was to exploit visible light generated by a common digital projector (like those used in classrooms) as a light source. Since the tested photoacid generators working under visible light are ineffective for the polymerization of epoxidized oils, a multi-component photo-initiating mixture was used.","2579":"We present a fully-integrated solution for controlling pneumatically-driven microfluidic chips, featuring a pump, one or more pressure regulators and up to 32 solenoid valves, controlled by a microcontroller. The microfluidics control system requires only a power source and a computer or mobile device for its operation. A touchscreen interface communicates with the microcontroller over USB or Bluetooth and allows users to control the system with ease either manually or autonomously, allowing experiments to run with no user intervention. The pressure regulators were purpose-built, enabling integrated pressure sources on-board, rather than relying on external equipment. These regulators can also be used as stand-alone devices in any other application. (C) 2019 The Authors.

While mechanical, chemical, and biological methods exist for the identification and treatment of these invasive species, they are manually intensive, inefficient, costly, and can cause collateral ecological damage. To address current deficiencies in aquatic weed management, this paper details the development of a small fleet of fully autonomous boats capable of subsurface hydroacoustic imaging (to scan aquatic vegetation), machine learning (for automated weed identification), and herbicide deployment (for vegetation control). These capabilities aim to minimize manual labor and provide more efficient, safe (reduced chemical exposure to personnel), and timely weed management. Geotagged hydroacoustic imagery of three aquatic plant varieties (Hydrilla, Cabomba, and Coontail) was collected and used to create a software pipeline for subsurface aquatic weed classification and distribution mapping. Employing deep learning, the novel software achieved a classification accuracy of 99.06% after training.","2585":"Being able to perform promptly and accurate emergency calls is crucial for every human life. However, people with impairments feel precluded when there is need to have access to emergency centers. The main reason is the absence of IP-based emergency systems triggered by assistive devices and body area networks. To guarantee that anyone can benefit from emergency systems, it is essential to enable embedded devices to trigger calls to emergency centers and support IP-based real time communication. To achieve this, the present paper extends SEEK framework (Andriopoulou et al., 2018), an embedded framework consisting of environmental, body sensors and a haptic device. SEEK framework enables elderly and disabled people who live independent to perform emergency calls. Sensors embedded in SEEK, aggregate environmental data and vital signs that monitor user's current health status 7and automatically trigger emergency calls when an emergency occurs, providing continuous real-time sensor data. The haptic device provides further modalities to the end user (disabled person or elderly) supporting audio, media and text communication with first responders and healthcare providers at emergency centers. A prototype implementation and initial results are presented as a proof of concept for deaf and speech impaired people enabling them to report emergency events and establish real time communication with first responders. The results depict that even lower capability hardware platforms may be used in order to minimize the cost and increase usability by minimizing power consumption of such an embedded framework.

Autonomous cars must deal with tasks at different levels. Although some of them are currently solved, and perception systems provide quite an accurate and complete description of the environment, high-level decisions are hard to obtain in challenging scenarios. Moreover, they must comply with safety, reliability and predictability requirements, road user acceptance, and comfort specifications. This paper presents a path planning algorithm based on potential fields. Potential models are adjusted so that their behavior is appropriate to the environment and the dynamics of the vehicle and they can face almost any unexpected scenarios. The response of the system considers the road characteristics (e.g., maximum speed, lane line curvature, etc.) and the presence of obstacles and other users. The algorithm has been tested on an automated vehicle equipped with a GPS receiver, an inertial measurement unit and a computer vision system in real environments with satisfactory results.","2587":"This paper presents an implementation of real-time energy management systems (EMS) to maximize the efficiency of the electricity distribution in an isolated hybrid microgrid system (HMGS) containing photovoltaic modules, wind turbine, battery energy storage system, and diesel generator (DG) which is used as a backup source. These systems are making progress worldwide thanks to their respect for the environment. However, hybridization of several sources requires power flow control (PFC). For this reason, in this work, a proper energy management system is developed using LabVIEW software and embedded in a suitable platform for the real-time management of the hybrid energy system. The developed EMS is tested and validated through a small-scale application which accurately represents the case study of an isolated mosque located in a remote area of Morocco. The aim of this paper is to (i) propose a novel modelling method and real-time monitoring interface under the LabVIEW software based on the real data obtained by an optimal sizing previously made using Homer-pro software and (ii) implement the power control system on a low-consumption embedded platform that is the Raspberry-pi3.","2590":"Pressure myography, one of the most commonly used techniques in vascular research, measures the diameter of isolated, pressurized arteries to assess the functional activity of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Despite the widespread adoption of this technique for assessing vascular function, there are only a small number of commercial systems and these are expensive. Here, we introduce a complete, open source pressure myograph system and analysis software, VasoTracker, that can be set-up for approximately 10% of the cost of commercial alternatives. We report on the development of VasoTracker and demonstrate its ability to assess various components of vascular reactivity. A unique feature of the VasoTracker platform is the publicly accessible website (http:\/\/www.vasotracker.com\/) that documents how to assemble and use this affordable, adaptable, and expandable pressure myograph.","2591":"Background Obesity in older adults is a significant public health concern. Weight-loss interventions are known to improve physical function but risk the development of sarcopenia. Mobile health devices have the potential to augment existing interventions and, if designed accordingly, could improve one's physical activity and strength in routine physical activity interventions. Methods and results We present Amulet, a mobile health device that has the capability of engaging patients in physical activity. The purpose of this article is to discuss the development of applications that are tailored to older adults with obesity, with the intention to engage and improve their health. Conclusions Using a team-science approach, Amulet has the potential, as an open-source mobile health device, to tailor activity interventions to older adults.","2593":"Swarm robotics in maritime engineering is a promising approach characterized by large numbers of relatively small and inexpensive autonomous aquatic crafts (AACs) to monitor marine environments. Compared with a single, large aquatic manned or unmanned surface vehicle, a highly distributed aquatic swarm system with several AACs features advantages in numerous real-world maritime missions, and its natural potential is qualified for new classes of tasks that uniformly feature low cost and high efficiency through time. This article develops an inexpensive AAC based on an embedded-system companion computer and open-source autopilot, providing a verification platform for education and research on swarm algorithm on water surfaces. A topology communication network, including an inner communication network to exchange information among AACs and an external communication network for monitoring the state of the AAC Swarm System (AACSS), was designed based on the topology built into the Xbee units for the AACSS. In the emergence control network, the transmitter and receiver were coupled to distribute or recover the AAC. The swarm motion behaviors in AAC were resolved into the capabilities of go-to-waypoint and path following, which can be accomplished by two uncoupled controllers: speed controller and heading controller. The good performance of velocity and heading controllers in go-to-waypoint was proven in a series of simulations. Path following was achieved by tracking a set of ordered waypoints in the go-to-waypoint. Finally, a sea trial conducted at the China National Deep Sea Center successfully demonstrated the motion capability of the AAC. The sea trial results showed that the AAC is suited to carry out environmental monitoring tasks by efficiently covering the desired path, allowing for redundancy in the data collection process and tolerating the individual AACs' path-following offset caused by winds and waves.","2594":"Nowadays, navigation systems are becoming common in the automotive industry due to advanced driver assistance systems and the development of autonomous vehicles. The MPU-6000 is a popular ultra low-cost Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU) used in several applications. Although this mass-market sensor is used extensively in a variety of fields, it has not caught the attention of the automotive industry. Moreover, a detailed performance analysis of this inertial sensor for ground navigation systems is not available in the previous literature. In this work, a deep examination of one MPU-6000 IMU as part of a low-cost navigation system for ground vehicles is provided. The steps to characterize the performance of the MPU-6000 are divided in two phases: static and kinematic analyses. Besides, an additional MEMS IMU of superior quality is also included in all experiments just for the purpose of comparison. After the static analysis, a kinematic test is conducted by generating a real urban trajectory registering an MPU-6000 IMU, the higher-grade MEMS IMU, and two GNSS receivers. The kinematic trajectory is divided in two parts, a normal trajectory with good satellites visibility and a second part where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal is forced to be lost. Evaluating the attitude and position inaccuracies from these two scenarios, it is concluded in this preliminary work that this mass-market IMU can be considered as a convenient inertial sensor for low-cost integrated navigation systems for applications that can tolerate a 3D position error of about 2 m and a heading angle error of about 3 degrees.","2596":"Open Innovation is widely explored, and many technologies are developed to support the involvement of stakeholders in its distributed co-design process, i.e. when actors work asynchronously and at a geographical distance. One of the fundamental parameters for the success of distributed collaborative approaches is the trust that the actors have in each other, in the current process and in technology. However, practitioners make little use of trust as a parameter for piloting and supporting co-creation of value. The lack of understanding of the mechanisms involved seems to explain this situation. Using a multiple-case-study analysis of co-design in the field of energy, this paper proposes to identify the levers in Living Lab favouring the trust between stakeholders. In addition to practical illustration, this paper provides a first co-design project management framework for practitioners, through the development of the \"Co-coon Matrix\".","2598":"The ability to reliably detect faults is essential in many real-world tasks that robot swarms have the potential to perform. Most studies on fault detection in swarm robotics have been conducted exclusively in simulation, and they have focused on a single type of fault or a specific task. In a series of previous studies, we have developed a robust fault-detection approach in which robots in a swarm learn to distinguish between normal and faulty behaviors online. In this paper, we assess the performance of our fault-detection approach on a swarm of seven physical mobile robots. We experiment with three classic swarm robotics tasks and consider several types of faults in both sensors and actuators. Experimental results show that the robots are able to reliably detect the presence of hardware faults in one another even when the swarm behavior is changed during operation. This paper is thus an important step toward making robot swarms sufficiently reliable and dependable for real-world applications.","2599":"Managing interactions between human activities and marine mammals often relies on an understanding of the real-time distribution or occurrence of animals. Visual surveys typically cannot provide persistent monitoring because of expense and weather limitations, and while passive acoustic recorders can monitor continuously, the data they collect are often not accessible until the recorder is recovered. We have developed a moored passive acoustic monitoring system that provides near real-time occurrence estimates for humpback, sei, fin and North Atlantic right whales from a single site for a year, and makes those occurrence estimates available via a publicly accessible website, email and text messages, a smartphone\/tablet app and the U.S. Coast Guard's maritime domain awareness software. We evaluated this system using a buoy deployed off the coast of Massachusetts during 2015-2016 and redeployed again during 2016-2017. Near real-time estimates of whale occurrence were compared to simultaneously collected archived audio as well as whale sightings collected near the buoy by aerial surveys. False detection rates for right, humpback and sei whales were 0% and nearly 0% for fin whales, whereas missed detection rates at daily time scales were modest (12%-42%). Missed detections were significantly associated with low calling rates for all species. We observed strong associations between right whale visual sightings and near real-time acoustic detections over a monitoring range 30-40 km and temporal scales of 24-48 hr, suggesting that silent animals were not especially problematic for estimating occurrence of right whales in the study area. There was no association between acoustic detections and visual sightings of humpback whales. The moored buoy has been used to reduce the risk of ship strikes for right whales in a U.S. Coast Guard gunnery range, and can be applied to other mitigation applications.","2600":"In the last few years, we witnessed numerous episodes of terrorist attacks and menaces in public crowded places. The necessity of better surveillance in these places pushed the development of new automated solutions to spot and notify possible menaces as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a novel approach to create a decentralized architecture to manage patrolling drones and cameras exploiting lightweight protocols used in the internet of things (IoT) domain. Through the adoption of the mist computing paradigm it is possible to give to all the object of the smart ecosystem a cognitive intelligence to speed up the recognition and analysis tasks. Distributing the intelligence among all the objects of the surveillance ecosystem allows a faster recognition and reaction to possible warning situations. The recognition of unusual objects in certain areas, e.g., airports, train stations and bus stations, has been made using computer vision algorithms. The adoption of the IoT protocols in a hierarchical architecture provides high scalability allowing an easy and painless join of other smart objects.
