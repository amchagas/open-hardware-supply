The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the \u201cArduino\u201d open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alternate_title1":"Comput Appl Eng Educ","authors":["Jawaid, I.","Javed, M.Y.","Jaffery, M.H.","Akram, A.","Safder, U.","Hassan, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1002\/cae.22184","end_page":"192","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"10613773 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["cognitive development","collaborative learning (CL)","integrated learning","open-source platform","project-based learning (PBL)","robotics","Bluetooth","Controllers","Curricula","Microcontrollers","Open source software","Robot programming","Robotics","Teaching","Cognitive development","Collaborative learning","Integrated learning","Open source platforms","Project based learning","Computer aided instruction"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"178","title":"Robotic system education for young children by collaborative-project-based learning","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075951428&doi=10.1002%2fcae.22184&partnerID=40&md5=dfa9e4a2b251053dd383689d89d4031c","volume":"28","year":"2020","author_address":"[Jawaid, Iqra] Univ Cent Punjab, Dept Elect Engn, Lahore, Pakistan.

This system reduced seawater pH up to \u22120.9 units and increased temperature up to +6\u2103 in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a 40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification, and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and consistent treatment manipulations. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.","alternate_title1":"Ecology and Evolution","authors":["Duarte, G.","Calderon, E.N.","Pereira, C.M.","Marangoni, L.F.B.","Santos, H.F.","Peixoto, R.S.","Bianchini, A.","Castro, C.B."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1002\/ece3.1670","end_page":"4566","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"20457758 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Experimental biology","Flow-through system","Marine mesocosm","Open-source board control system","PCO2 reactor","Realism","Stress physiology"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"20","start_page":"4555","title":"A novel marine mesocosm facility to study global warming, water quality, and ocean acidification","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945400876&doi=10.1002%2fece3.1670&partnerID=40&md5=080953ab3598e48c8bf2d239a0d113c9","volume":"5","year":"2015","author_address":"[Duarte, Gustavo; Calderon, Emiliano N.; Pereira, Cristiano M.; Marangoni, Laura F.

Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcL\/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale. \u00a9 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

miniaturization, sophistication, proliferation, and accessibility of technologies are enabling the capture of more and previously inaccessible phenomena in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the \u201cbig data\u201d acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and\/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society","alternate_title1":"Mov.

This application requires dedicated transmit\/receive (Tx\/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx\/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (\u03bb\/4) stubs. Methods: The \u03bb\/4 stubs in the proposed Tx\/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil\/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of \u221235.7dB\/\u221241.5dB during transmission\/reception. The insertion loss was \u22120.41dB\/\u22120.27dB during transmission\/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx\/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated.

Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficient (Formula presented.) for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domain E-field probes. Results: Repeatability and precision are ~3% for E-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, ~3% for temperature slopes and an ~6% root-mean-square deviation between (Formula presented.) measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces the E-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with ~100\u00a0\u03bcK resolution and ~14\u00a0Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode. Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7\u00a0T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing. \u00a9 2020 physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt.

The control design approach illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable, constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored with the Creativity Award \u201cfor building a land robot from scratch in less than 2 days when their ground platform broke.\u201d. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alternate_title1":"J.

Advances in open-source hardware allow students, researchers and hobbyists to custom build devices for a wide variety of purposes. Open-source prototyping platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi empower people to build cheap, modular, and easy to use alternatives to expensive commercial grade scientific equipment. The authors argue that the use of open-source hardware in building neuroIS research tools will dramatically decrease the costs and complexity associated with research in university laboratories. In this work, we discuss the use of open-source hardware in neuroIS research. We present the design of a neuroIS research tool based on BITalino, a biosignal capturing and processing platform.

Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %. Solutions are suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool considered in this work. \u00a9 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","alternate_title1":"Int J Adv Manuf Technol","authors":["Tristo, G.","Bissacco, G.","Lebar, A.","Valentin\u010di\u010d, J."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s00170-014-6725-3","end_page":"1521","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"02683768 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["EDM","Efficiency","Electrical discharge machining","Energy","Micromachining","Monitoring","Sustainability","Data acquisition","Digital storage","Efficiency","Electric discharge machining","Electric discharges","Energy utilization","Machine tools","Manufacture","Micromachining","Milling (machining)","Monitoring","Open source software","Open systems","Software engineering","Sustainable development","Data acquisition system","EDM","Electrical discharge machining","Energy","Energy consumption monitoring","Energy efficiency analysis","Manufacturing companies","Manufacturing facility","Energy efficiency"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"9-12","start_page":"1511","title":"Real time power consumption monitoring for energy efficiency analysis in micro EDM milling","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929376612&doi=10.1007%2fs00170-014-6725-3&partnerID=40&md5=e43dab76c7131f5af53c895aa5406105","volume":"78","year":"2015","author_address":"[Tristo, Gianluca] Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy.

Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests. The margin advantage, net present value, and return on investment (ROI) analysis provided herein could form the basis of thousands of new small-business ventures in the coming years.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Laplume, A","Anzalone, GC","Pearce, JM"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s00170-015-7970-9","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"0268-3768","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Open-source, self-replicating 3-D printer factory for small-business manufacturing","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"85","year":"2016","author_address":"[Laplume, Andre] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

Thus, since the development of 3D printing, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most promising and inexpensive techniques for shaping free-form parts. It used a thermoplastic filament as a starting material to extrude, layer by layer, the suitable 3D object. It is assisted by a large community of developers, searchers, and users and with multiple free hardware and software open sources expanding the scope of its applications. However, in this process, printing objects with multi-materials and multicolors becomes a major challenge for most extrusion system of printing platforms. For example, in case it is required to print multi-material and multicolored parts, a high-quality head extruder should be used. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of proposing a new extruder system of printing parts with multicolors and materials. For this purpose, in the present paper, the different extrusion systems capable of printing parts with multicolors and materials were presented. The operating principle of each extrusion system is well explained through functional diagrams. Then, its advantages and disadvantages are cited. Finally, some prospects for improving these systems are presented and that will be the work of the next paper. \u00a9 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","alternate_title1":"Int J Adv Manuf Technol","authors":["Boulaala, M.","Elmessaoudi, D.","Buj-Corral, I.","El Mesbahi, J.","Ezbakhe, O.","Astito, A.","El Mrabet, M.","El Mesbahi, A."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s00170-020-05847-0","end_page":"55","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"02683768 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D printing","Electronic control","Multi-extruder","Multi-material","Multicolor","3D modeling","Application programs","Computer aided design","Deposition","Extruders","Extrusion","Layered manufacturing","Electronic controls","Extruder systems","Functional diagrams","Fused deposition modeling (FDM)","Hardware and software","ITS applications","Manufacturing technologies","Operating principles","Fused Deposition Modeling"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1-2","start_page":"45","title":"Towards design of mechanical part and electronic control of multi-material\/multicolor fused deposition modeling 3D printing","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089255414&doi=10.1007%2fs00170-020-05847-0&partnerID=40&md5=e0755d77e48df178a2be697837d166c0","volume":"110","year":"2020","author_address":"[Boulaala, Mohammed; Astito, Abdelali; El Mrabet, Mhamed] Fac Sci & Technol, LIST, Comp Sci Syst & Telecommun Lab, Tangier, Morocco.

This paper introduces a design for a low-cost smart meter system as well as explaining fundamentals of smart metering. The smart meter platform, provided as open hardware, is designed with a connector interface compatible to the Arduino platform, thus opening the possibilities for smart meters with flexible hardware and computation features, starting from low-cost 8 bit micro controllers up to powerful single board computers that can run Linux. The metering platform features a current transformer which allows a non-intrusive installation of the current measurement unit. The suggested design can switch loads, offers a variable sampling frequency, and provides measurement data such as active power, reactive and apparent power. Results indicate that measurement accuracy and resolution of the proposed metering platform are sufficient for a range of different applications and loads from a few watts up to 5\u00a0kW. \u00a9 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","alternate_title1":"Comput.

Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it. Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural analysis, etc. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","alternate_title1":"Auton Robots","authors":["Valero-G\u00f3mez, A.","Gonz\u00e1lez-G\u00f3mez, J.","Trevi\u00f1o, R."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s10514-013-9324-5","end_page":"249","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"09295593 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D printers","Mechanical design","Object oriented programming","Open hardware","Open robotics","Open source","Software development","Development platform","Emerging technologies","Mechanical components","Mechanical design","Mechanical development","Open hardware","Open source communities","Open sources","3D printers","Application programs","Computer simulation","Hardware","Object oriented programming","Product design","Software engineering","Robotics"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"233","title":"A new paradigm for open robotics research and education with the C plus plus OOML","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877876489&doi=10.1007%2fs10514-013-9324-5&partnerID=40&md5=845c313c747764eff397eb86d48b72bf","volume":"34","year":"2013","author_address":"[Valero-Gomez, Alberto; Gonzalez-Gomez, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Robot Lab, Madrid, Spain.

The frequently cited promises of modular robotics\u2014versatility, robustness, and low cost\u2014assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2\u00a0g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open source hardware. \u00a9 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","alternate_title1":"Auton.

We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","alternate_title1":"Autom Software Eng","authors":["Duley, A.","Spandikow, C.","Kim, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s10515-012-0107-6","end_page":"490","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"09288910 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Hardware description languages","Program differencing","Software evolution","Code review","Concurrent computation","Differencing algorithm","Hardware design","Language constructs","Open sources","Program differencing","Quantitative evaluation","Sequential execution","Software Evolution","User study","Verilog","Verilog hardware description languages","Verilog HDL","Algorithms","Computer hardware description languages","Semantics","Software engineering","Hardware"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":"459","title":"Vdiff: A program differencing algorithm for Verilog hardware description language","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865228187&doi=10.1007%2fs10515-012-0107-6&partnerID=40&md5=c0d6046b3c64d460975d5e0bfba2ab04","volume":"19","year":"2012","author_address":"[Kim, Miryung] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

At this time, contact sensors are have limited applicability due to their continuous wear, so there is a need to develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing management prescription guidelines through risk detection. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","alternate_title1":"Multimedia Tools Appl","authors":["Choi, S.","Youm, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s11042-017-5452-9","end_page":"28434","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"13807501 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Elder","Fall detection","Monitoring","Open source hardware","Cameras","Costs","Disabled persons","Hardware","Monitoring","Abnormal conditions","Daily life activities","Elder","Elderly populations","Fall detection","Monitoring system","Open-source hardwares","Prescription guidelines","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"20","start_page":"28423","title":"A study on a fall detection monitoring system for falling elderly using open source hardware","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038086118&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-017-5452-9&partnerID=40&md5=d33161b6f3310e4fbad21a45fb21185b","volume":"78","year":"2019","author_address":"[Choi, Seunghyun; Youm, Sekyoung] Dongguk Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 82-1 Pil Dong, Seoul, South Korea.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :4","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: MTAPF","Correspondence Address: Youm, S.; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 82-1, Pil-dong, Chung-gu, South Korea; email: sekyoungyoum@gmail.com"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Springer New York LLC","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000485997700005","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Choi, Seunghyun Youm, Sekyoung","author_keywords":"Fall detection; Elder; Open source hardware; Monitoring","beginning_page":"28423","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"14","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"IX9HC","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"1573-7721","email_address":"sekyoungyoum@gmail.com","ending_page":"28434","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea [17CTAP-C114867-02]","funding_text":"This work was supported by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea.

The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use.

Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1.

The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments. \u00a9 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","alternate_title1":"Swarm Intell.","authors":["Valentini, G.","Antoun, A.","Trabattoni, M.","Wiandt, B.","Tamura, Y.","Hocquard, E.","Trianni, V.","Dorigo, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s11721-018-0155-z","end_page":"266","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"19353812 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Automated data collection","Kilobot","Kilogrid","Open source","Swarm robotics","Tracking","Virtualization","Data acquisition","Hardware","Open source software","Robotics","Site selection","Surface discharges","Virtual reality","Virtualization","Automated data collection","Kilobot","Kilogrid","Open sources","Swarm robotics","Swarm intelligence"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"245","title":"Kilogrid: a novel experimental environment for the Kilobot robot","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041107763&doi=10.1007%2fs11721-018-0155-z&partnerID=40&md5=e24016b613452abdc834a81916a73d89","volume":"12","year":"2018","author_address":"[Valentini, Gabriele; Antoun, Anthony; Trabattoni, Marco; Dorigo, Marco] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIDIA, Brussels, Belgium.

A careful analysis of the assumptions and challenges of maker cultures emphasizes the relevance of what may be called technological action, that is, active and critical interventions regarding the purposes and applications of technologies within ordinary lives, thus countering the deterministic trends of current directions of technology. In such transformative potential, we will explore a set of elements what is and could be technological action through snapshots of maker cultures based on the empirical research conducted in three particular contexts: the Fab Lab Network, Maker Media core outputs and initiatives such as Maker Faires, and the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA). Elements such as control and empowerment through material engagement, openness and sharing, and social, cultural, political and ethical values of the common good in topics such as diversity, sustainability and transparency, are critically analysed. \u00a9 2016, The Author(s).","alternate_title1":"Sci.

These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab\u2019s approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen\/civic veillance, or \u201csousveillance\u201d, by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide. \u00a9 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","alternate_title1":"Sci.

Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388\u2013393, 2018) defined the \u201copen-o-meter\u201d, i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project\u2019s process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects\u2019 process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project\u2019s process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project\u2019s process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations. \u00a9 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","alternate_title1":"Int.

An existing Indian power network i.e., real power system network of C.G. state, consisting of 132\u00a0kV, 50\u00a0Hz power transmission network connecting Doma substation 220\/132\u00a0kV to the 132\/33\u00a0kV Gas Insulated Substation Rawanbhata through combined transmission network is considered. This real power transmission network is simulated by using MATLAB\/Simulink software. In this paper, the hardware implementation is also carried out using an open-source hardware, Arduino, which consists of an Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller. Both the simulation and hardware results validate that the proposed scheme is accurately detecting, classifying, and locating the fault in less than a half cycle time.

Historically, the solutions to each of these challenges have been custom and rarely replicated exactly. For the IMS research community few detailed resources exist that explicitly detail the construction and operation of ion mobility systems. In an effort to address this knowledge gap we outline a solution to one of the key aspects of a drift tube ion mobility system, the ion gate pulser. Bradbury-Nielsen or Tyndall ion gates are found in nearly every research-grade and commercial IMS system. While conceptually simple, these gate structures often require custom, high-voltage, floating electronics. In this report we detail the operation and performance characteristics of a wifi-enabled, MOSFET-based pulser design that uses a lithium-polymer battery and does not require high voltage isolation transformers. Currently, each output of this circuit follows a TTL signal with ~20\u00a0ns rise and fall times, pulses up to +\/\u2212 200\u00a0V, and is entirely isolated using fiber optics. Detailed schematics and source code are provided to enable continued use of robust pulsing electronics that ease experimental efforts for future comparison. \u00a9 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","alternate_title1":"Int.

The superior\u2013inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno\u2122, a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS\u2122 anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3\u00a0%-1\u00a0mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6\u00a0%, respectively. It was verified that 100\u00a0% of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12\u00a0Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique. \u00a9 2016, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.","alternate_title1":"Australas.

An algorithm for reconstructing 3D images from overlapping 2D intensity measurements with relaxed camera positioning requirements is compared with a single-camera solution for single-side 3D printing monitoring. The algorithms are tested for different 3D object geometries and filament colors. The results showed that both of the algorithms with a single- and double-camera system were effective at detecting a clogged nozzle, incomplete project, or loss of filament for a wide range of 3D object geometries and filament colors. The combined approach was the most effective and achieves 100% detection rate for failures. The combined method analyzed here has a better detection rate and a lower cost compared to previous methods. In addition, this method is generalizable to a wide range of 3D printer geometries, which enables further deployment of desktop 3D printing as wasted print time and filament are reduced, thereby improving the economic advantages of distributed manufacturing. \u00a9 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","alternate_title1":"Prog.

This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors. \u00a9 2019, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc.","alternate_title1":"Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration","authors":["Mardonova, M.","Choi, Y."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1007\/s42461-019-0093-3","end_page":"674","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"25243462 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Environmental monitoring","Industry 4.0","Mining","Open-source hardware","Open-source software","3D printers","Accident prevention","Application programs","Costs","Environmental engineering","Industrial hygiene","Industry 4.0","Mining","Monitoring","Open systems","Android applications","Environmental Monitoring","Environmental monitoring system","Occupational health","Open-source hardwares","Open-source technology","Remote communication","Underground tunnels","Open source software"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":"657","title":"Toward Open-Source Hardware and Software for the Mining Industry: a Case Study of Low-Cost Environmental Monitoring System for Non-Metallic Underground Mines","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069493500&doi=10.1007%2fs42461-019-0093-3&partnerID=40&md5=0556e1f34d0970cc4d4bfda2010ce840","volume":"36","year":"2019","author_address":"[Mardonova, Mokhinabonu; Choi, Yosoon] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :2","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Choi, Y.; Department of Energy Resources Engineering, South Korea; email: energy@pknu.ac.kr"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000477587100007","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Mardonova, Mokhinabonu Choi, Yosoon","author_keywords":"Open-source hardware; Open-source software; Industry 4; 0; Environmental monitoring; Mining","beginning_page":"657","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"84","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"IL9ED","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"2524-3470","email_address":"energy@pknu.ac.kr","ending_page":"674","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2018R1D1A1A09083947]","funding_text":"This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2018R1D1A1A09083947).","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Mining Metall.

This is due to the model allowing for the lowering of costs and widespread distribution of manufacturing. On the other hand, low adherence to its best practices and insufficient development may jeopardize OSH as a viable aid against the pandemic. In this work, we sought to clarify to what extent publicly available designs of ventilator and PPE are developed and abide by OSH standards as measure of the true openness of the solutions. Methods: We searched the Internet and the literature to compile a comprehensive list of ventilators and PPE, while assessing available documentation in order to objectively evaluate key development landmarks (e.g., testing and governmental clearance) and indicators of adherence by OSH standards, as described by the Open Source Hardware Association. Results: Only a few peer-reviewed articles have been found, while a good number of Internet entries of open ventilator and PPE designs were found. Available documentation varied a lot in quantity and quality. Overall, adherence to OSH best practices and level of development were only partially fulfilled. Conclusions: Although this suboptimal performance regarding openness of designs may limit the benefits of the model, data suggests that present open-source efforts are highly beneficial and that they will be able to completely fulfill their mission given more and better OSH is carried out. \u00a9 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.","alternate_title1":"Res.

To bring about synchronized movements of the main 5-axis tape-laying head system and the 3-axis ultrasonic tape-cutting sub-system, the tracking-control method associated with time-based mode attributed to PMAC is applied in different cases. In addition, with the goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000 system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also designed.

The system architecture was designed with a particular stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product Generator and Processing System were developed. Vesta processor Vesta RPG and its front end application Vesta\u03b6Process deal with product and composite generation, data base management and web server links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard protocols. Results obtained with this prototype are now being extended to other 6 radars under a National Program for the modernization of the Cuban Weather Radar Network, which also includes composition and distribution of the products.

The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","alternate_title1":"Addit.

IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the products attached to the tags with product information and their respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow. The web page which is built in accordance to provide convenient and an interface to the user to track the products. The developed system results a very low cost system and works dynamically compared with the existing present warehouse inventory management systems.

The information obtained from the sensors is collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet, which permits us to access the information in real time. On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy performance and providing information related to the data storage and its cost of development. The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple applications of Smart Environments.

Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.","alternate_title1":"Autom Constr","authors":["Frei, M.","Deb, C.","Stadler, R.","Nagy, Z.","Schlueter, A."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.autcon.2019.103043","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"09265805 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Building performance","In-situ measurements","Indoor environment","Open-source hardware","Performance gap","Remote monitoring","Sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Buildings","Heat flux","Network architecture","Open source software","Open systems","Sensors","Software testing","Wireless sensor networks","Building performance","In-situ measurement","Indoor environment","Open-source hardwares","Performance gaps","Remote monitoring","Sensor nodes"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Wireless sensor network for estimating building performance","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076692662&doi=10.1016%2fj.autcon.2019.103043&partnerID=40&md5=b8591147663fde9f0b14d280ac4daa28","volume":"111","year":"2020","author_address":"[Frei, Mario; Deb, Chirag; Stadler, Ruben; Schlueter, Arno] ETH, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.

Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers.

In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis is usually performed through the liberation of the carbohydrate moieties from proteins, followed by fluorescent labeling and identification using either standardized HPLC or mass spectrometry techniques. A simple and robust automated process for the release and isolation of N-glycans would greatly improve analytical throughput and reproducibility, and is thus highly desirable. Inspired by the increasing number of reported projects involving open source labware, which allows the design and construction of otherwise inaccessible laboratory equipment using low-cost 3D printers, we used this technique to fabricate a platform for the automated isolation of N-glycans. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the successful recovery of glycan samples from the glycoprotein model fetuin using our self-made 3D-printed equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyte (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","alternate_title1":"Chemometr. Intelligent Lab.

A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

The DPHP probe has been tested for soil thermal properties assessment and compared to TDR probe for the water content estimation in four different soils. The DPHP probe showed an accuracy comparable to TDR in estimating water content, with DPHP showing lower values of error index in 3 samples out of 4.

This task can become difficult taking into account that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino and, afterwards, sent to a Raspberry Pi. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to control automotive functionalities.

Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors. \u00a9 2014.","alternate_title1":"Curr.

While these plates have a good track record, they can become symptomatic and require removal once the fracture has healed. Open hardware removal is associated with a number of additional risks to the patient, including infection, scarring, nerve damage, and blood loss. In addition, the recovery time after open hardware removal may be prolonged, thereby predisposing the patient to postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for removing proximal humerus locking plates arthroscopically. Although technically demanding, the benefits of this technique include smaller incisions, quicker recovery time, decreased risk of infection, and reduced blood loss. Arthroscopy also provides the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intra-articular pathology at the time of surgery. Additionally, we use a bone-void filler to reduce the risk of fracture through stress caused by previous screw holes. \u00a9 2016 Arthroscopy Association of North America.","alternate_title1":"Arthroscopy Tech.","authors":["Voleti, P.B.","Camp, C.L.","Sinatro, A.L.","Dines, J.S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.eats.2016.01.009","end_page":"e346","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"22126287 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["arthroscope","arthroscopic accessory","arthroscopic cannula","arthroscopic surgery","Article","bone filler","bone plating system","device removal","dissection","fluoroscopy","fracture","human","incision","infection risk","locking screw","operative blood loss","patient safety","positioning device","postoperative care","priority journal","range of motion","risk reduction","rotator cuff","scar","shoulder arthroscopy","single distal lateral portal","spinal needle","surgical technique","suture removal","time","wound irrigation"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"2","start_page":"e343","title":"Arthroscopic Removal of Symptomatic Proximal Humerus Locking Plates With Bone-Void Filler Augmentation","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962791848&doi=10.1016%2fj.eats.2016.01.009&partnerID=40&md5=f1b3c6d27735ec326ad17644b80e8585","volume":"5","year":"2016","author_address":"[Voleti, Pramod B.; Camp, Christopher L.; Sinatro, Alec L.; Dines, Joshua S.] Hosp Special Surg, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021 USA.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :4","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Dines, J.S.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, 535 East 70th Street, United States; email: dinesj@hss.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Arthroscopy Techniques","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000382235200021","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Voleti, Pramod B.

This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino (R) boards, Lego (R) building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied.

Due to major modifications ASDEX Upgrade is still in operation. Infrastructure like data acquisition, workstations, etc. is being modernized, interfaces like RS-232 are vanishing and new interfaces are being introduced. This leads to the necessity to adapt old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with a large number of libraries. In this paper the use of Arduino boards for replacing the position unit, the stub tuner interface and its use controlling a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with phase control capability are shown. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these \"smart things\" is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over \"smart things\" as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Within this context, the farm's management decisions include information from data collected about the crops health development, which need to be gathered in a timely basis. There are several means of obtaining information about the plants health, including manual data collection from sensors installed in the soil and\/or its vicinity, mobile sensor systems, for example embedded sensors in UAVs, or aircrafts, or other vehicles, and satellite imagery, to name just a few examples. The adoption of UAVs in such applications has gaining a lot of attention in recent years due to ease of access, low cost and available flight control software. UAV systems may carry several sensors, which include RGB, infrared, multispectral and hyper-spectral cameras. These cameras are respectively more powerful, in terms of data quality, as well as more expensive. The current paper contribution include the platform model, design and characterization of a multispectral camera system made from two low cost, commercial of the shelf cameras that can be integrated in a small UAV. These aforementioned cameras are compatible with open source hardware, namely Raspberry Pi boards, that are used to collect, process and store information.

This approach combines several different technologies: A Raspberry Pi for control and monitoring, Python to control the system and chart data, as well as converters and drivers with serial I2C bus interface connectivity to read\/write data from\/to Puma560 robot.

This platform emerged from research on the automatic rotation start-up and landing of a tethered airplane for wind energy harvesting, implementing and testing promising theoretical concepts such as real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) and non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) on hardware developed in parallel. As experimental setups for testing new control algorithms tend to be fine-tuned by trial and error methods, a rapid control prototyping system for fast evaluation had to be implemented. Technical results of this research are presented in the form of a modular platform for real-time control. The created platform provides a complete toolchain for performing, observing and evaluating control experiments. It offers modular low-cost hardware and free software especially suited for flight control experiments. Clearly defined interfaces between the components allow for expanding on its current capabilities for other control scenarios in need of fast and reliable real-time control. The provided modularity allows for spatial separation of high performance computing hardware from low-level components, permits rapid reconfiguration of the experiment and eases the collaboration and workflow between hardware developers and control engineers.

Nanotechnology is an area where fundamental or applicative research is still in progress and where many industrial applications are waited to come. Despite the progress of this field, many institutions, notably educational ones, cannot afford investing in these technologies allowing an access to nanoscale, and a lack of knowledge therefore remains. The Nanoeye project focuses on the widespread of Atomic Force Microscopy or AFM technology, which is the basic access tool to the nanoscale. The main goal is to design an optimal AFM model in terms of manufacturing costs by using rapid prototyping techniques and open-source hardware, and designing it as an educational-oriented equipment. This approach is two-fold: as an AFM-unexperienced user discovering its principle of operation at nanoscale or as a future engineer understanding its multi-disciplinary structure involving mechanics, optics, electronics, software and control sciences. This paper introduces the first functional structure of Nanoeye AFM project, focusing on its mechanical structure. It is submitted to the IFAC2017 special feature Automatic Control Demonstrators.

Modern information technology and intelligent equipment are the development direction of agriculture. In this paper, a remote-control system for greenhouse environment was developed based on Raspberry Pi, MySQL and Android. The system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database (subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature\/humidity, soil temperature\/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including real-time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC\/pH control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to greenhouses. All monitoring settings can be operated remotely by users. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production. In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafames (Castello, Spain). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These datasets must be made publicly available for the community could validate and accept them. It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz. Also, a proof-of-concept dataset is provided comprising sampled data from 12 subjects suitable for gait analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","alternate_title1":"J. Biomed.

The focus is on the \"design global, manufacture local\" model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a \"design global, manufacture local\" model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. \"Design global, manufacture local\" may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production.

The participants are consisted of daytime education (30) and evening education (42) students who attended the \"Power Electronics\" course. First, groups were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups and experimental group and control group were examined according to the students' GPAs, university entrance exam results, academic grades depending on 8 different lectures related with power electronics. According to the results obtained from validity and reliability of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test, the total correlation values and the standard deviation values of Power Electronics Course Achievement Test were between.301-,.598 and between.304-,.506, respectively. In addition, KR20 coefficient was found as 0.844. Before application of the \"Power Electronics Course Achievement Test\", there was not a significant difference in total scores of both daytime and evening education students. Although students received Web-Based Education and Web Aided Education were selected as experimental group, the students received \"Traditional Education\" were selected as control group. After the application, significant differences between the total grade points of both experimental and control groups of daytime education and evening education students were detected.

This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a 'pop-up' flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or 'pop-out') angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints\/limits on actuator torque\/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems.

Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing.

Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI featuring low-noise (< 0.6 mu V p-p input noise), electromagnetic compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7T), and user-programmable real-time signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG\/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.

Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 2000 platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL\/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL\/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a single sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","alternate_title1":"J.

Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17 ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http:\/\/www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu\/CRNL\/tools\/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","alternate_title1":"J.

High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil. New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil. Results\/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination. Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals. \u00a9 2018","alternate_title1":"J. Neurosci.

This is performed thanks to the design of a methodology of using a thermal simulation tool with experimental measurements based on a low-cost open source hardware platform in order to evaluate the energy saving measures and analyse the thermal comfort and energy savings. To accomplish this, a study of the housing needs is performed a priori to later design the different actions in the rehabilitation, using if possible, ecological materials in its development. Basically, walls and ceilings are insulated, three solar air collectors are included to heat the air ventilation and decrease the heating demand, and two pellet stoves are installed. Finally, the refurbished house is modeled and simulated in EnergyPlus and compared with the indoor air temperature and relative humidity measurements, made using an Open-Source Monitoring System (OSMS) developed for this research in Arduino, obtaining results with no significant differences without the need to calibrate the system. The results of thermal comfort, heating and cooling demand and heating energy consumption of the house before and after the renovation are compared providing a decrease in thermal demand of 66% and a decrease in heating energy consumption of 50% in the winter season, where 60% of the energy consumed is contributed from renewable sources. In terms of thermal comfort, the comparison of the PPD and PMV values shows an improvement in the house in heating and cooling season. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","alternate_title1":"J. Build.

The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.

In this paper, a low-cost build-your-own (BYO) semi-automated three-axis PCB milling machine for double-sided PCB prototyping is developed using commercial components and open source hardware and free open source software, to provide students, teachers, and engineers an accessible and affordable resource for PCB prototyping. Also, the main problems encountered during fabrication of PCB have been mentioned and the techniques used to solve them are discussed in detail. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000\/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device.

Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.","alternate_title1":"Mechatronics","authors":["Bihari, N.","Dash, S.P.","Dhankani, K.C.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.mechatronics.2018.07.005","end_page":"187","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"09574158 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3-D printing","FOSH","Gimbal system","Open source hardware","Optoelectronics","Rotator","Transmittance","Antireflection coatings","Costs","Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","Errors","Glass","Glass industry","Light sources","Mean square error","Optoelectronic devices","Reflective coatings","Solar power generation","Stepping motors","Transparent conducting oxides","3-D printing","FOSH","Gimbal system","Open-source hardwares","Rotator","Transmittance","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"175","title":"3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system for optoelectronic measurements","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050803399&doi=10.1016%2fj.mechatronics.2018.07.005&partnerID=40&md5=5dffb5214b2852bf7a056cb33b9796a8","volume":"56","year":"2018","author_address":"[Bihari, Nupur; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 601 M&M Bldg, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays.

The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card.

The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research. This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","alternate_title1":"Microprocessors Microsyst","authors":["Ebeid, E.","Skriver, M.","Terkildsen, K.H.","Jensen, K.","Schultz, U.P."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.micpro.2018.05.002","end_page":"20","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"01419331 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Drone simulators","Drones","Flight controllers","Open platforms","Survey","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)","Controllers","Drones","Fault tolerance","Flight simulators","Hardware","Open source software","Open systems","Software reliability","Surveying","Surveys","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Closed source","Development and testing","Disruptive innovations","Flight controllers","Open platforms","Open-source hardwares","Platform elements","Research and development","Aircraft control"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"11","title":"A survey of Open-Source UAV flight controllers and flight simulators","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047362689&doi=10.1016%2fj.micpro.2018.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=cb9a34b84aad307a79b277c950a7217f","volume":"61","year":"2018","author_address":"[Ebeid, Emad; Skriver, Martin; Terkildsen, Kristian Husum; Jensen, Kjeld; Schultz, Ulrik Pagh] Univ Southern Denmark, SDU UAS Ctr, Campusvej 55, Odense, Denmark.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :29","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: MIMID","Correspondence Address: Ebeid, E.; SDU UAS Center, Campusvej 55, Denmark; email: esme@mmmi.sdu.dk"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Microprocessors and Microsystems","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000441486700002","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Ebeid, Emad Skriver, Martin Terkildsen, Kristian Husum Jensen, Kjeld Schultz, Ulrik Pagh","author_keywords":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); Drones; Flight controllers; Drone simulators; Open platforms; Survey","beginning_page":"11","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"33","conference_date":"AUG 30-SEP 01, 2017","conference_host":null,"conference_location":"Vienna, AUSTRIA","conference_sponsors":"Univ Technol Vienna, Austrian Inst Technol, Austrian Comp Soc, OCG","conference_title":"20th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD) \/ Session on European Projects in Digital Systems Design (EPESD)","date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"GQ2LO","document_type":"Article; Proceedings Paper","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"1872-9436","email_address":"esme@mmmi.sdu.dk","ending_page":"20","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [779882]; Irmovationfund Denmark (IFD) Free the Drones (FreeD) project","funding_text":"This work is supported and partly funded by the European Union's Horizon2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 779882 (TeamPlay) and the Irmovationfund Denmark (IFD) Free the Drones (FreeD) project.","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Microprocess.

For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: \u201cLABI-Imaging\u201d for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and \u201cRmsiGUI\u201d, a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers\u2019 community. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.","alternate_title1":"Microchem.

Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits.

ATCA platform has shown tremendous growth and proved to be stable and well represented by a number of vendors. ATCA is an industry standard for highly available systems. On the other hand Service Availability Forum, a consortium of leading communications and computing companies, describes interaction between hardware and software. SAF defines a set of specifications such as Hardware Platform Interface, Application Interface Specification. SAF specifications provide extensive description of highly available systems, services and their interfaces. Originally aimed for telecom applications, these specifications can be used for accelerator controls software as well. This study describes benefits of using these specifications and their possible adoption to accelerator control systems.

The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots\/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% +\/- 0.4% for low SNR (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future.","alternate_title1":"Nucl Instrum Methods Phys Res Sect A","authors":["Alsanea, F.","Darne, C.","Hojo, Y.","Beddar, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.nima.2019.05.038","end_page":"21","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"01689002 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Camera","CMOS","Proton therapy","Scintillator","Trigger","CMOS integrated circuits","Image acquisition","Microcontrollers","Phosphors","Proton beam therapy","Proton beams","Quality assurance","Scanning","Scintillation counters","Background signals","Liquid scintillator","Proton therapy","Scintillator detector","Signal intensities","Standard deviation","Synchrotron beams","Trigger","Cameras"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"16","title":"A novel imaging scheme for optical cameras used in a quality assurance detector for discrete spot scanning proton beam systems","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066260360&doi=10.1016%2fj.nima.2019.05.038&partnerID=40&md5=1af17ddc603f96611e0c6c28e6580af3","volume":"939","year":"2019","author_address":"[Alsanea, Fahed; Darne, Chinmay; Hojo, Yoshifumi; Beddar, Sam] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Phys, 1515 Holcombe Blvd,Unit 94, Houston, TX 77030 USA.

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs. \u00a9 2016 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Dhankani, K.C.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2016.07.001","end_page":"12","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Lab mixer","Mixer","Open hardware","Open source hardware","Rotator mixer","Shaker","Mixers (machinery)","Mixing","Open systems","Battery powered","Commercial equipment","Mixing angle","Open hardware","Open sources","Open-source hardwares","Operation mode","Shaker","Laboratories"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"1","title":"Open source laboratory sample rotator mixer and shaker","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029545496&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2016.07.001&partnerID=40&md5=415b27191f3b589b6cda4168303dd5dc","volume":"1","year":"2017","author_address":"Department of Mechanical Engineering\u2013Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :26","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Pearce, J.M.1400 Townsend Drive, United States; email: pearce@mtu.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":111,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Automatic feeders are widely used in animal experiments to dispense an accurate amount of food reward for each trial.

The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON\/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW\/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW\/cm2. The fans and the ON\/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17 \u00b0C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 h of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 h and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light. \u00a9 2017 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Chen, X.","Leon-Salas, W.D.","Zigon, T.","Ready, D.F.","Weake, V.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2017.07.001","end_page":"33","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Drosophila","Embedded computers","Light-emitting diodes","Open hardware","Optical stimulation","Rhodopsin","Enclosures","Fabrication","Heating","Light emitting diodes","Temperature control","Drosophila","Embedded computers","Open hardware","Optical stimulation","Rhodopsin","Ophthalmology"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"13","title":"A programmable optical stimulator for the Drosophila eye","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037867638&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2017.07.001&partnerID=40&md5=933a0812ece9472a544175e163053d66","volume":"2","year":"2017","author_address":"Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, 175 South University Street, West Lafayette, IN, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :3","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Leon-Salas, W.D.; School of Engineering Technology, 401 North Grant Street, United States; email: wleonsal@purdue.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":116,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"This article describes the design of a low-cost USB-controlled potentiostat\/galvanostat which can measure or apply potentials in the range of \u00b18 V, and measure or apply currents ranging from nanoamps to max. \u00b125 mA.

Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot's ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than $700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24 h. Filament is produced at 0.4 kg\/h using 0.24 kWh\/kg with a diameter \u00b14.6%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents\/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250 \u00b0C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing. \u00a9 2018 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Woern, A.L.","McCaslin, J.R.","Pringle, A.M.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2018.e00026","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3-D printing","Circular economy","Composites","Extruder","Fused filament fabrication","Materials science","Open hardware","Open source hardware","Plastic","Polymer composites","Polymers","Recyclebot","Recycling","RepRap","Upcycle","Waste plastic","Composite materials","Costs","Extruders","Fabrication","Industrial research","Materials science","Open systems","Plastic filaments","Plastics","Plastics extruders","Polymers","Printing presses","Recycling","3-D printing","Circular economy","Open hardware","Open-source hardwares","Polymer composite","Recyclebot","RepRap","Upcycle","Waste plastic","Plastic recycling"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"RepRapable Recyclebot: Open source 3-D printable extruder for converting plastic to 3-D printing filament","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047619898&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2018.e00026&partnerID=40&md5=b0f42485d755d59c5d6f53b2f7244356","volume":"4","year":"2018","author_address":"Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI  49931, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00026","notes":["Cited By :23","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Pearce, J.M.; Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, United States; email: pearce@mtu.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":122,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"This paper presents an easy-to-use, easy-to-customize, and low cost device for remote monitoring of Cultural Heritage environments such as museums, art galleries, and historical archives.

This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0\u20135 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable. A new methodology, described here, facilitates the cross-comparability of turbidity measurements. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Kitchener, B.G.B.","Dixon, S.D.","Howarth, K.O.","Parsons, A.J.","Wainwright, J.","Bateman, M.D.","Cooper, J.R.","Hargrave, G.K.","Long, E.J.","Hewett, C.J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2019.e00052","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino","Light-absorption","Light-scattering","Open-source hardware","Sensors","Suspended-sediment","Turbidity","3D printers","Angle measurement","Calibration","Costs","Data acquisition","Firmware","Light absorption","Light scattering","Light sources","Open systems","Sensors","Turbidity","Arduino","Calibration methodologies","Data acquisition system","Embedded microcontroller","Illumination intensity","Open-source hardwares","Suspended sediment concentrations","Turbidity measurements","Suspended sediments"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"A low-cost bench-top research device for turbidity measurement by radially distributed illumination intensity sensing at multiple wavelengths","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059849069&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00052&partnerID=40&md5=772381d1a985d59d30f2ae213d6a68b9","volume":"5","year":"2019","author_address":"Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Sheffield, United Kingdom","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00052","notes":["Cited By :2","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Kitchener, B.G.B.; Department of Physics & Astronomy, United Kingdom; email: b.kitchener@sheffield.ac.uk"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":128,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"A low-cost open-source wideband current sensor, measuring currents in a frequency range from DC to 5 MHz, is proposed.

All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode.

In contrast, the USV platform proposed in this paper is completely open-source, from hardware to software; most parts of the platform can be 3D-printed, and it can be easily modified and upgraded in terms of both design and programming. The platform is equipped with off-the-shelf water sensors for acquiring data like as pH, turbidity, and temperature to measure water quality in real water resources (such as ponds, reservoirs, and lakes). Furthermore, we provide an Android application through which users can easily control the USV via Bluetooth and display the sensor and GPS data the platform generates. We validated the performance of the platform in terms of usability, mobility, and stability through field experiments in various locations, including both the USA and Peru. Moreover, we present a potential application and approach in which this platform can navigate autonomously by utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Bluetooth protocols. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Jo, W.","Hoashi, Y.","Paredes Aguilar, L.L.","Postigo-Malaga, M.","Garcia-Bravo, J.M.","Min, B.-C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2019.e00076","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino","Underwater Thruster Control","Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs)","Water Monitoring System","3D printers","Air navigation","Bluetooth","Costs","Open source software","Open systems","Reservoirs (water)","Surface waters","Water quality","Android applications","Arduino","Bluetooth protocol","Open-source hardwares","Robot operating systems (ROS)","Thruster control","Water monitoring systems","Water quality monitoring","Unmanned surface vehicles"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"A low-cost and small USV platform for water quality monitoring","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070203790&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00076&partnerID=40&md5=1a8f5df5a2f0fce12c0b89e9308b3b9d","volume":"6","year":"2019","author_address":"SMART Laboratory, Department of Computer and Information Technology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN  47907, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00076","notes":["Cited By :6","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Min, B.-C.; SMART Laboratory, United States; email: minb@purdue.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":132,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Recent progress in neuro-prosthetic technology gives rise to the hope that in the future blind people might regain some degree of visual perception. It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to \u00b170 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Rotermund, D.","Ernst, U.A.","Pawelzik, K.R."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2019.e00078","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Closed-loop experiments","ECoG","Electrical stimulation","Neuro-implant","Neuro-prosthetics","Open Hardware","Visual cortex prosthesis","Electrodes","Open source software","Prosthetics","Vision","Closed-loop experiments","ECoG","Electrical stimulations","Open hardware","Visual cortexes","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Open Hardware for neuro-prosthesis research: A study about a closed-loop multi-channel system for electrical surface stimulations and measurements","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071623888&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00078&partnerID=40&md5=b4896edf587405d2e3fb73d79501f6e8","volume":"6","year":"2019","author_address":"University of Bremen, Institute for Theoretical Physics, Bremen, Germany","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00078","notes":["Cited By :2","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Rotermund, D.; University of Bremen, Germany; email: davrot@neuro.uni-bremen.de"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":133,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Syringe pumps are widely used in a multitude of tasks where precise volumes of an extrudate need to be delivered at a specific flow rate. In the past decade various open source syringe pump designs have accelerated scientific research and exploration by reducing costs and introducing new ideas. To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems. Here the dosing accuracy and repeatability of the Ystruder are quantified, and we demonstrate its functionality both as a syringe pump and a paste extruder for 3D printing. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Klar, V.","Pearce, J.M.","K\u00e4rki, P.","Kuosmanen, P."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2019.e00080","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D printing","Additive manufacturing","Extruder","Monitoring","Open hardware","Open source hardware","Paste extruder","Sensing","Syringe pump","Extruders","Monitoring","Open systems","Pumps","Syringes","3-D printing","Open hardware","Open-source hardwares","Sensing","Syringe pumps","3D printers"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Ystruder: Open source multifunction extruder with sensing and monitoring capabilities","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072947448&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00080&partnerID=40&md5=ad37a9f8f7ff2ebfadeddf264263f506","volume":"6","year":"2019","author_address":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aalto University School of Engineering, Espoo, Finland","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00080","notes":["Cited By :6","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Klar, V.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Finland; email: ville.klar@aalto.fi"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":134,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Reliable, accurate, and affordable linear motion control systems for precision agriculture applications are currently not easily accessible due to their elevated cost. Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm\/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1\/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Lopez Alcala, J.M.","Haagsma, M.","Udell, C.J.","Selker, J.S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2019.e00081","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Environmental sensing","Greenhouse sensing","Hyperspectral Imaging","Linear motion","Open source hardware","3D printers","Control systems","Costs","Greenhouses","Hyperspectral imaging","Motion control","Spectroscopy","Stepping motors","Agriculture applications","Environmental sensing","Linear motion","Linear motion control","Linear motion systems","Minimum efforts","Open-source hardwares","Stepper motor drivers","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"HyperRail: Modular, 3D printed, 1\u2013100\u202fm, programmable, and low-cost linear motion control system for imaging and sensor suites","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078706767&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00081&partnerID=40&md5=0c30ae934010cd927d384ef564612eb5","volume":"6","year":"2019","author_address":"Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab, OR, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, OR, USA; Department of Biological and Ecological Engineering, Oregon State University, OR, USA","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00081","notes":["Cited By :2","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Selker, J.S.; Department of Biological and Ecological Engineering, United States; email: john.selker@oregonstate.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":135,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"This paper presents an open-source and low-cost characterization device designed to investigate the behavior of active textiles, which are textiles having the ability to actuate (produce motion\/force) and or act as a sensor. Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Utter, B.","Marbaker, R.","Eschen, K.","Abel, J."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2019.e00083","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Active knitted textiles","Actuators","Materials characterization","Open-source hardware","Shape memory alloy","Actuators","Conducting polymers","Open systems","Shape memory effect","Shape-memory alloy","Displacement modes","Electrical stimuli","Electro-active polymers","Electronic systems","Experimental protocols","Materials characterization","Open-source hardwares","Shape memory alloy wire","Textiles"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Open-source experimental setup for investigating the actuation behavior of active textiles","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073984448&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2019.e00083&partnerID=40&md5=1d8ef031e18be5f14d0cf54e128bf4bb","volume":"6","year":"2019","author_address":"Lafayette College, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00083","notes":["Cited By :1","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Utter, B.; Lafayette CollegeUnited States; email: utterb@lafayette.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":136,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Electromyography (sEMG) is the technique applied to measure the bio-potential signal produced by a contracting skeletal muscle. sEMG has been used for subject intention estimation, force estimation, limb angle estimation and determining muscle activation timing.

In this paper we present a new camera system, developed with off the shelf and 3D printed cost effective components for use in shallow waters of <150 m depth. Integrating Raspberry Pi Zero W microcomputers with open source design files and software, it is hoped these camera systems will be of interest to the global marine and freshwater research communities. \u00a9 2020","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Purser, A.","Hoge, U.","Lemburg, J.","Bodur, Y.","Schiller, E.","Ludszuweit, J.","Greinert, J.","Wenzh\u00f6fer, F."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00102","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Marine imaging","Open source hardware","Rapid prototyping","Raspberry Pi","Time series","3D printers","Cameras","Cost effectiveness","Open source software","Rapid prototyping","Time series","Underwater imaging","Cost effective","Data collection","Environmental conditions","Environmental investigation","Open-source hardwares","Pressure-resistant","Research communities","Shallow waters","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"PlasPI marine cameras: Open-source, affordable camera systems for time series marine studies","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082171684&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00102&partnerID=40&md5=a228c02fa00303eb820419a0f2d2a8f7","volume":"7","year":"2020","author_address":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Science, Bremerhaven, Germany","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00102","notes":["Cited By :3","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Purser, A.; Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine ScienceGermany; email: autun.purser@awi.de"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":139,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"This paper presents the design, construction, operation, and validation of a robotic gantry platform specifically designed for studying fish-robot interaction.

The comparatively low cost and no-fluid-contact design of peristaltic pumps make them the go-to systems for such ventures, but using commercially available pumping systems this still becomes a costly endeavor at typically $250-$1000 per pump line. Here we have developed an alternative, a peristaltic pump that can be fabricated in most research laboratories using 3D-printing and readily available off-the-shelf parts. The pump features 8 parallel channels with linear ranges spanning from 0.7 \u00b5L\/min to 6 mL\/min. The pump can be fabricated and assembled by anyone with access to a 3D-printer at a cost of less than $45 per channel and is driven by a stepper motor that connects directly to any computer. This device has the potential to be disruptive in areas such as drug screening and assay development, as well as lab-on-a-chip applications and cell cultivation, where it significantly reduces hardware expenses and allows for construction of more comprehensive fluidic systems at a fraction of current costs. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["J\u00f6nsson, A.","Toppi, A.","Dufva, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00115","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D-printing","DIY","DLP","Ease-of-use","Off the shelf","Open hardware","Open source hardware","SLA","Stereolithography","3D printers","Fabrication","Pumps","Research laboratories","Stepping motors","Assay development","Cell cultivation","High throughput screening","Lab-on-a-chip applications","Large-scale studies","Multichannel system","Parallel channel","Peristaltic pump","Costs"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"The FAST Pump, a low-cost, easy to fabricate, SLA-3D-printed peristaltic pump for multi-channel systems in any lab","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086632472&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00115&partnerID=40&md5=2a9cf23c04555c39a93bc48fb39dafe4","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"DTU Health Tech, Technical University of Denmark, Kgs Lyngby, Denmark","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00115","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Dufva, M.; DTU Health Tech, Denmark; email: dufva@dtu.dk"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":141,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"The use of electrical resistivity tomography in laboratory or field experiments for environmental purposes has been increasing in recent years. The development of commercial devices has thus far focused on the quality of measurements and their robustness in all field cases. However, both their costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to specific applications have limited their prevalence in the environmental sector. This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O. Measurements were then carried out on a small field experiment, in demonstrating good stability of the OhmPi measurements, as well as a strong correlation with the output of a commercial reference instrument. \u00a9 2020 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Clement, R.","Fargier, Y.","Dubois, V.","Gance, J.","Gros, E.","Forquet, N."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00122","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Electrical resistivity","Electrical resistivity imaging","OhmPi","Quadrupole","Raspberry Pi","Resistivity meter","Time-lapse","Electric conductivity","Imaging techniques","Analog electrical circuits","Automatic measurements","Electrical resistivity imaging","Electrical resistivity tomography","Reference instruments","Reliability and robustness","Resistance measurement","Small-scale experiment","Open Data"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"OhmPi: An open source data logger for dedicated applications of electrical resistivity imaging at the small and laboratory scale","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087880841&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00122&partnerID=40&md5=28e75dc44215691070f5ed6068f6450f","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"INRAE, REVERSAAL, Villeurbanne Cedex, F-69626, France","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00122","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Clement, R.; INRAE, 5 rue de la Doua, CS 20244, France; email: remi.clement@inrae.fr"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":142,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Two-photon (2P) microscopy is a cornerstone technique in neuroscience research.

As a case study, open source face masks were 3-D printed in PEKK and shown not to warp upon widely home-accessible oven-based sterilization. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Skrzypczak, N.G.","Tanikella, N.G.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00130","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3-D printing","Additive manufacturing","COVID-19","High temperature 3-D printing","Medical hardware","Open hardware","Open source","Open source medical hardware","Polycarbonate","RepRap","ULTEM","High temperature applications","Printing presses","Sterilization (cleaning)","Tensile strength","3-D printing","Distributed manufacturing","High temperature","Low deformations","Open sources","Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)","Space heaters","Thermal sterilization","C (programming language)"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Open source high-temperature RepRap for 3-D printing heat-sterilizable PPE and other applications","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089798621&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00130&partnerID=40&md5=ef31252ca8cee2fd082bb96396752ef8","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"Mechanical Engineering \u2013 Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00130","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Pearce, J.M.; Department of Materials Science & Engineering, United States; email: pearce@mtu.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":146,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"This study describes the development of a simple and easy-to-build portable automated bag valve mask (BVM) compression system, which, during acute shortages and supply chain disruptions can serve as a temporary emergency ventilator. The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths\/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided. \u00a9 2020 The Authors","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Petsiuk, A.","Tanikella, N.G.","Dertinger, S.","Pringle, A.","Oberloier, S.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00131","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3-D printing","Coronavirus","Coronavirus pandemic","COVID-19","Embedded systems","Influenza pandemic","Medical hardware","Open hardware","Open source","Open source medical hardware","Pandemic","Pandemic ventilator","Real-time operating system","RepRap","Single-limb","Ventilation","Ventilator","Artificial organs","Computer operating systems","Resuscitation","Supply chains","Algorithmic approach","Clinical environments","Measurement circuit","Parametric components","Positive end expiratory pressures","Real time operating system","Serial peripheral interface","Supply-chain disruptions","Biological organs"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Partially RepRapable automated open source bag valve mask-based ventilator","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089470505&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00131&partnerID=40&md5=b21d2206222d5d0b75b53aeb929edf38","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00131","notes":["Cited By :2","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Pearce, J.M.; Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, United States; email: pearce@mtu.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":147,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"A major frontier in neuroscience is to find neural correlates of perception, learning, decision making, and a variety of other types of behavior.

This study develops a distributed manufacturing solution using only an open source manufacturing tool chain consisting of two types of open source 3-D printing and batch UV curing, and provides a parametric fully free design of a nasopharyngeal swab. The swab was designed using parametric OpenSCAD in two components (a head with engineered break point and various handles), which has several advantages: i) minimizing print time on relatively slow SLA printers, ii) enabling the use of smaller print volume open source SLA printers, iii) reducing the amount of relatively expensive UV resin, and iv) enabling production of handle on more accessible material extrusion 3-D printers. A modular open source UV LED box was designed, fabricated for $45 and tested for batch curing. Swabs can be fabricated for $0.06-$0.12\/swab. The results of the mechanical validation tests showed that the swabs could withstand greater forces than would be expected in normal clinical use. The swabs were also able to absorb a significant amounts of synthetic mucus materials and passed abrasion and handling tests.

Low-cost gas metal arc wire (GMAW)-based 3-D printing enables wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for near net shape applications, but has limited resolution due to the complexities of the arcing process. To begin to monitor and thus control these complexities, the initial designs of the open source GMAW 3-D printer have evolved to include current and voltage monitoring. Building on this prior work, in this study, the design, fabrication and use of the open source arc analyzer is described. The arc analyzer is a multi-sensor monitoring system for quantifying the processing during WAAM, which includes voltage, current, sound, light intensity, radio frequency, and temperature data outputs. The open source arc analyzer is tested here on aluminum WAAM by varying wire feed rate and measuring the resultant changes in the sensor data. Visual inspection and microstructural analysis of the printed samples looking for the presence of porosity are used as the physical indicators of quality. The value of the sensors was assessed and the most impactful sensors were found to be the light and radio frequency sensors, which showed arc extinction events and a characteristic \u201cgood weld\u201d peak frequency. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Pringle, A.M.","Oberloier, S.","Petsiuk, A.L.","Sanders, P.G.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00137","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3-D printing, gas metal arc weld, GMAW, metal inert gas welding, MIG welding, additive manufacturing, metal printing","Metal 3-D printing, low cost metal 3-D printer, open-source metal 3-D printer, GMAW 3-D printing","Open-source hardware","RepRap","WAAM","Welder","Welding","Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing","Additives","Costs","Gas metal arc welding","Gas welding","Quality control","Radio waves","Wire","Limited resolution","Microstructural analysis","Physical indicators","Radio frequencies","Radio frequency sensors","Scientific community","Visual inspection","Voltage monitoring","3D printers"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Open source arc analyzer: Multi-sensor monitoring of wire arc additive manufacturing","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091505709&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00137&partnerID=40&md5=5c6e99f3683498cf3ca542c8032e9906","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI  49931-1295, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00137","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Pearce, J.M.; Michigan Technological University, 601 M&M Building, 1400 Townsend Drive, United States; email: pearce@mtu.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":150,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Both the free and open source software (FOSS) as well as the distributed digital manufacturing of free and open source hardware (FOSH) has shown particular promise among scientists for developing custom scientific tools. Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH.

The instrument agitates and illuminates microalgae suspensions grown inside flasks. It was optimized for low production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, consistent, and controllable growth light intensity. The illuminated orbital shaker is especially well suited for low-resource research laboratories and education. It is an alternative to commercial instruments for microalgae cultivation. It improves on typical do-it-yourself microalgae growth systems by offering consistent and well characterized illumination light intensity. The illuminated growth area is 20 cm \u00d7 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or six 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The photosynthetic photon flux density, is variable in eight steps (26-800\u03bcmol\u00b7m-2\u00b7s-1) and programmable in a 24-h light\/dark cycle. The agitation speed is variable (0-210RPM). The overall material cost is around \u00a3300, including an entry-level orbital shaker. The build takes two days, requiring electronics and mechanical assembly capabilities. The instrument build is documented in a set of open-source protocols, design files, and source code.

There is an open area to develop and to build didactic modules to improve the learning process using experimentation in real physical systems. Particularly, a cart inverted pendulum is a classical physical system very commonly used in recent decades. We propose a cart inverted pendulum named MoDiCA-X as a low-cost didactic module with open source hardware and software. It is an electromechanical system feasible to build and easy to be modified. The mechanical parts of the module are 3D printed solids and can also be easily replicated. In terms of programming, the control applied to the system can be modified, since it uses C\/C++ programming languages that are widely used in the academic community. The module is equipped with two very commercial sensors, are easy to install and to remove; both acquire the pendulum attitude and the car position. The actuators are four electric DC motors coupled to the car wheels to provide suitable velocity and torque to each axle independently. We validate the performance of the module by applying a multivariable linear quadratic regulator algorithm (LQR). \u00a9 2020","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Pinares-Mamani, O.G.C.","Cutipa-Luque, J.C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00148","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D printer","Cart inverted pendulum","Control systems","Didactic module","3D printers","C++ (programming language)","Costs","DC motors","Open source software","Open systems","Pendulums","Academic community","Advanced control algorithms","Advanced control systems","Commercial sensors","Electromechanical systems","Linear quadratic regulator algorithms","Open-source hardwares","Real physical systems","Learning systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"A low-cost didactic module for testing advanced control algorithms","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093932419&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00148&partnerID=40&md5=e4e3b8228b1caffbb3e27af4aa7227f0","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00148","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Cutipa-Luque, J.C.; Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de ArequipaPeru; email: jcutipalu@unsa.edu.pe"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":153,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"The field of Open Source Hardware Mechanical Ventilators (OSH-MVs) has seen a steep rise of contributions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. As predictions showed that the number of patients would exceed current supply of hospital-grade ventilators, a number of formal (academia, the industry and governments) and informal (fablabs and startups) entities raced to develop cheap, easy-to-fabricate mechanical ventilators. The presence of actors with very diverse modus operandi as well as the speed at which the field has grown, led to a fragmented design space characterized by a lack of clear design patterns, projects not meeting the minimum functional requirements or showing little-to-no innovation; but also valid alternatives to hospital-grade devices. In this paper we provide a taxonomic system to help researchers with no background in biomedical engineering to read, understand and contribute to the OSH-MV field. The taxonomy is composed of ten properties that are read through the lenses of three reflection criteria: buildability, adoptability and scalability. We applied the taxonomy to the analysis of seventeen OSH-MV projects, which are representative of the current landscape of possibilities available for COVID-19 patients. We discuss the different design choices adopted by each project highlighting strengths and weaknesses and we suggest possible directions for the development of the OSH-MV field. \u00a9 2020","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Mora, S.","Duarte, F.","Ratti, C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00150","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Biomedical equipment","COVID-19","Digital manufacturing","Literature review","Mechanical ventilator","Open-source hardware","Taxonomic system","Biomedical engineering","Hospitals","Taxonomies","Current supplies","Design Patterns","Functional requirement","Modus operandi","Open-source hardwares","State of the art","Taxonomic systems","Through the lens","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Can Open Source Hardware Mechanical Ventilator (OSH-MVs) initiatives help cope with the COVID-19 health crisis?

However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules \u2013 each with a specific set of functionalities \u2013 to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, this concept will allow academic groups to improve replicability and reproducibility in cell culture process operations towards more economical and innovative research in the future. \u00a9 2020","alternate_title1":"HardwareX","authors":["Eggert, S.","Mieszczanek, P.","Meinert, C.","Hutmacher, D.W."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.ohx.2020.e00152","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24680672 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D cell culture","Additive biomanufacturing","Automation","Bioprinting","Hydrogels","Liquid handling robot","Modularity","Open source hardware","Reproducibility","Workstation","Automation","Cell culture","Design and assemblies","Engineering frameworks","High throughput studies","Off-the-shelf hardwares","Open-source hardwares","Open-source technology","Photoinduced polymerization","Research applications","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"OpenWorkstation: A modular open-source technology for automated in vitro workflows","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093954328&doi=10.1016%2fj.ohx.2020.e00152&partnerID=40&md5=89adaca5203991d6667578f5b6a799a1","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"Centre in Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD  4000, Australia","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"e00152","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Eggert, S.; Centre in Regenerative Medicine, Australia; email: sebastian.eggert@tum.de"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"HardwareX","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":155,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Light sensors can provide valuable information about environmental exposure; however, current light sensing packages are limited.

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.

As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

Despite the evidence, the preparedness and response of citizens has been limited. This underlines the importance of having sustainable air quality monitoring solutions that foster inclusion and multi-stakeholder partnerships for social-scientific interventions. This study illustrates how AirBox project has emerged in Taiwan, where makers and citizens use the sensors to sense air quality and provide the public with actionable data about their environments. The AirBox project includes elements of technology-innovation and citizen science: (1) Participatory Sensing \u2013 Static and mobile air quality sensing, (2) Open Data \u2013 Open hardware, software and access to data, (3) Co-creation Citizen Science \u2013 Citizen-led campaigns and forums, and (4) Outreach \u2013 Knowledge sharing, trust building and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The project uses a wide range of sensors to provide extendable solutions and data at fine spatio-temporal resolution. The results are highlighted using five cases studies that show how integrating social dimensions in an air quality monitoring framework can lead to public awareness, data-driven applications and environmentally sustainable cities.

To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are reported. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","alternate_title1":"Sustainable Energy Technol.

This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1\/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H\/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H\/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H\/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support.

We present a hand-held, automatic capillary viscometer, termed Viscopette which can be fabricated simply by assembling globally available mechanical (a stepper motor and an inline pressure sensor), fluidic (a positive-displacement pipette and a cut tubing piece), electronic (an Arduino board) parts in a 3D-printed housing. The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm x 7.3 cm x 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition. With the advantages of easeof-use, portability, and shear-rate controllability, we demonstrate the Viscopette's ability to accurately analyze Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Our method addresses the unmet need in portable, highperformance viscometers suitable for use as an open-source equipment, which can facilitate on-site, accurate viscosity analysis even by non-expert users.

Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d interface comprised a 1.0\u00a0m\u00d70.25\u00a0mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GC\u00d7GC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GC\u00d7GC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GC\u00d7GC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.","alternate_title1":"Talanta","authors":["Muc\u00e9dola, V.","Vieira, L.C.S.","Pierone, D.","Gobbi, A.L.","Poppi, R.J.","Hantao, L.W."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.talanta.2016.12.005","end_page":"476","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"00399140 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Chemical education","Mass spectrometry","Multidimensional gas chromatography","Petroleum","Poly(dimethylsiloxane)","Volatile organic compound","Cooling systems","Cost effectiveness","Crude oil","Essential oils","Mass spectrometry","Modulation","Petroleum distillates","Phase interfaces","Smoke detectors","Thermal desorption","Volatile organic compounds","Chemical education","Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography","DC power supplies","Fluidic interface","Loop configuration","Modulation strategy","Multidimensional gas chromatography","Resistive heating","Gas chromatography"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"470","title":"Thermal desorption modulation for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography using a simple and inexpensive segmented-loop fluidic interface","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85003704147&doi=10.1016%2fj.talanta.2016.12.005&partnerID=40&md5=9d762490994a0f202f3b8db770a443b2","volume":"164","year":"2017","author_address":"[Mucedola, Vanessa; Vieira, Luis C.

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84\u201327.7m\u20ac\/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy.

Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this perspective, we do not review all the current advances of Lab-on-a-chip techniques for the realisation of PoC. Instead, we aim to provide insight into what we foresee as the three most important factors to play the essential roles for succeeding in making commercially viable PoC pathogen-detection devices. The three insights are namely: the utilizations of (i) disposable polymer (microfluidic) chips, (ii) the implementation of surface-bound (or solid-phase) nucleic-acid amplification techniques and (iii) relying (more) on open-source hardware and software.

Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm\u22122), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm\u22122). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsification in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.","alternate_title1":"Ultrason.

Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10-10 hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.

These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.

In this paper, we investigate KM practices and needs in Open Source Hardware (OSH) communities. The aim is to provide insights into the KM issues and challenges facing these communities. Our analysis is based on interviews carried out with the participants of 22 projects. Interview transcriptions were coded and tagged with concepts extracted from the literature. Text mining was used to uncover the main concepts embedded in the corpus. From this analysis, knowledge sharing emerged as one of the top-rated concepts. Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations. High contributor turnover, little or no standardization and weak project structuring are still key challenges for OSH communities when it comes to ensuring awareness, making decisions and sharing knowledge. \u00a9 The Author(s), 2020.","alternate_title1":"Des.

Here, we write to introduce analytical chemists who are new to the open-source movement to best practices and concepts in this area and to survey the state of open-source research in analytical chemistry. We conclude by considering two examples of open-source projects from our own research group, with the hope that a description of the process, motivations, and results will provide a convincing argument about the benefits that this movement brings to both creators and users. \u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society.","alternate_title1":"Anal.

However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an all-in-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 \u00d7 31 \u00d7 26 cm 3 ), light (&lt;3 kg), and affordable (\u20ac810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one open-source system were made freely available at https:\/\/github.com\/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself. \u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society.","alternate_title1":"Anal.

However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications. \u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society.","alternate_title1":"ACS Biomater.

However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PLA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.","alternate_title1":"ACS Sustainable Chem.

Here, we present the smfBox, a cost-effective confocal smFRET platform, providing detailed build instructions, open-source acquisition software, and full validation, thereby democratising smFRET for the wider scientific community. Broad uptake of smFRET has been hindered by high instrument costs and a lack of open-source hardware and acquisition software.

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).","alternate_title1":"Sci.

We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users. \u00a9 2019, The Author(s).","alternate_title1":"Sci.

The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware, API, and software, is available online for community-based development and collaboration. \u00a9 2019, The Author(s).","alternate_title1":"Sci.

Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.","alternate_title1":"Sci.

However, outside of neuroscience, the impact of optogenetics has been limited by a lack of user-friendly, flexible, accessible hardware. Here, we engineer the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA), a device that can deliver two independent 310 to 1550 nm light signals to each well of a 24-well plate with intensity control over three orders of magnitude and millisecond resolution. Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under $400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day. We use the LPA to precisely control gene expression from blue, green, and red light responsive optogenetic tools in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells and simplify the entrainment of cyanobacterial circadian rhythm. The LPA dramatically reduces the entry barrier to optogenetics and photobiology experiments. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2016.","alternate_title1":"Sci.

In its most common embodiment, samples are prepared in the laboratory, and injected into the capillary column using an autosampler. Analytes are separated, and detected by one of several available detection systems, including mass spectrometry (MS). However, this mode of operation is not convenient when monitoring dynamic chemical systems - for example, reaction mixtures. Here we present a facile approach for automated sampling, and subsequent introduction of samples to a GC apparatus in order to enable monitoring of dynamic chemical processes in real time. The proposed system incorporates two pinch valves, a peristaltic pump, a thermoshaker, and an electronic control unit (Raspberry Pi microcomputer) with several relays. The device facilitates dosing small volumes of liquid samples to the injection port of a commercial GC-MS apparatus. A program in C language controls the operation of the pump (on\/off, direction of flow) and actuation of the pinch valves, and it initiates GC-MS runs. The system has been characterised with artificial samples, and successfully used in the monitoring of transesterification reactions catalysed by single microbeads containing immobilised lipase, as well as in the monitoring of the extraction of natural products from plant tissue samples. We believe that - following further improvements - this automated approach may be adapted for monitoring industrial processes and environmental analysis.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Ting, H","Hu, JB","Hsieh, KT","Urban, PL"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1039\/c4ay00637b","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"1759-9660","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"A pinch-valve interface for automated sampling and monitoring of dynamic processes by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"6","year":"2014","author_address":"[Ting, Hsu; Hu, Jie-Bi; Hsieh, Kai-Ta; Urban, Pawel L.] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Appl Chem, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.

An appropriately constructed flow cell can be connected to a flow reactor made out of transparent polymeric material such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing. The flow cell can be moved to different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine the residence time distribution (RTD) of various microreactors\/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition time of the novel device the lengths of individual segments can be measured in real time. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","alternate_title1":"React. Chem.

The separator relies on the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases, the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The separator-whose performance is competitive with far costlier commercial systems-is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for its firmware. \u00a9 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","alternate_title1":"React.

Ethernet-based networks, such as EtherCAT, allow every part of an automation system, from sensors to robots, to exchange information at high speeds. This gives the controller instant access to every detail of production information. Once this controller is also connected to the enterprise-level Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). End-user IT departments will have to work more closely with engineering to allow shop-floor equipment to have direct access to enterprise-level systems without the use of middleware. The latest controllers, such as Omron's Sysmac NJ series, combine the reliability and rugged design of a traditional PLC, but use an open hardware architecture combined with software ?engines' within a single CPU, rather than multiple CPUs, to manage their different functions. Ricoh plans to use similar instant communication with an enterprise-level database to scan codes on used toner cartridges sent to its Telford site for recycling. In this case, an NJ controller will allow data, including the number of previous refills, to be checked. This will in turn enable the system to determine whether any given cartridge should be refilled again, while also updating the database. The FAG SmartCheck from Schaeffler FAG recognises and reports the first vibrations of a system long before any noise is generated. That means there is substantially longer time to react before the machine fails.","alternate_title1":"Eng.

Supplies quickly ran dry, so a group gathered in Tokyo's Hackerspace to design and build their own under the name Safecast. Before they did anything, they consulted the Internet. Joichi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab and founding member of Safecast, explained at the group's anniversary and conference in March this year: \"When we had the earthquake, most of us didn't know about radiation or even starting up communities. We called out on the Internet, asking: 'Do you know anything about this?' Someone would say 'I know the person who did the monitoring sensors for Three Mile Island'. \"We put together quite a good team having started from zero. We couldn't have designed this as quickly without open hardware or without the help of the Internet. That is a big trend that we are seeing the beginning of.\" The result of the hacking project was the bGeigie, a combination of a Geiger counter, GPS receiver and data recorder. Users submit their data to the Safecast database by uploading it from the bGeigie's SD card, usually from a network-enabled computer rather than the device itself. Ray Ozzie, former chief software architect of Microsoft and the adviser to Safecast, came up with the idea of putting the small initial number of handmade Geiger counters on the outside of car windows, so they could be driven round to maximise the number of readings around Japan that the team could record.","alternate_title1":"Eng.

According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called 'the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an 'input', 'output', and some 'information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their 'methods'.

The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media.

Today, cooperating organizations require an approach through which the system is accessible to a diverse blend of nontechnical users with differing applications. These multiparticipant groups also demand technology capable of managing the distribution of data to these numerous end users. To accommodate these requirements, six important trends have evolved: Continuous geographic coverage, spatial-relational data-base management, topological structures, distributed processing, content management, and open hardware and software architectures.

MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon counting optical\/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry. This readout is based on open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research. Designed principally for radio telescope backends, it is flexible enough to be used for a variety of signal processing applications. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond.

The interface has been fully designed with the open code philosophy and all documentation will be accessible on web. The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype. A comparative analysis of performance was made by using the same chemical detector but changing the measurement instrumentation. Published by AIP Publishing.","alternate_title1":"Rev. Sci.

However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within \u223c15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70. \u00a9 2020 Author(s).","alternate_title1":"Rev.

A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces\u2019 social media presence serve as the \u2018front door\u2019 for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different \u2018front doors\u2019 of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces\u2019 social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces\u2019 social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces\u2019 social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations.

The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including \u2018open hardware\u2019): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself \u2018making,\u2019 manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and\/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation. \u00a9 2019, Copyright \u00a9 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","alternate_title1":"Hum Comput Interact","authors":["Bak\u0131rl\u0131o\u011flu, Y.","Kohtala, C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1080\/07370024.2019.1574225","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"07370024 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Manufacture","Open systems","Academic fields","Business-as-usual","Design community","Empirical studies","Environmental sustainability","Innovation cycles","Research fields","Systematic literature review","Sustainable development"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Framing Open Design through Theoretical Concepts and Practical Applications: A Systematic Literature Review","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062349521&doi=10.1080%2f07370024.2019.1574225&partnerID=40&md5=99ab0a50f72f0a3e6ebd9bbddaedff52","volume":"34","year":"2019","author_address":"[Bakirlioglu, Yekta] Univ Limerick, Sch Design, Design Factors Res Grp, Limerick, Ireland.

Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011\u20132012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early \u201cMIT school\u201d of synthetic biology. In 2013\u20132015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may be relevant to other developing countries. \u00a9 2020, \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alternate_title1":"Crit.

To lower these barriers, we have developed the openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer interfaces.

Yet the role of domestic spaces in shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city, despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user innovation literatures to present the methodology for the \"Homesense\" research project that explored how users design and develop \"smart\" technologies within their own homes, based on the intersection of their concurrent urban\/domestic lived experience. Kits of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located \"lead users\" provided technical expertise. This methodology demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and \"lived\" expertise in developing these interventions. \u00a9 2012 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology.","alternate_title1":"J.

In this paper, based on ethnographic fieldwork studies in Barcelona working with urban accessibility professionals and activists, we argue for the importance of the \u2018documentation interfaces\u2019 created in their struggles: that is, the relational processes to collaboratively build multi-media accounts in a diversity of formats seeking to enforce different translations of bodily needs into specific urban accessibility arrangements. In discussion with the asymmetries that the ongoing expertization of accessibility might be opening up, we would like to foreground these apparently irrelevant practices as an interesting site to reflect on how urban accessibility struggles might allow us to rethink the project of technical democracy and its applications to urban issues. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the creation of Streets for All, a platform to contest and to sensitize technicians and citizens alike of the problems of \u2018shared streets\u2019 for the blind and partially sighted led by the Catalan Association for the Blind; and (2) the organization of the Tinkerthon, a DIY and open-source hardware workshop boosted by En torno a la silla to facilitate the creation of a network of tinkerers seeking to self-manage accessibility infrastructures. These cases not only bring to the fore different takes on the democratization of the relations between technical professionals and disability rights advocates, but also offer different approaches to the politics of universals in the design of urban accessibility arrangements. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alternate_title1":"City","authors":["S\u00e1nchez Criado, T.","Cereceda Ot\u00e1rola, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1080\/13604813.2016.1194004","end_page":"636","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"13604813 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["disability","documentation interfaces","technical democracy","universal design","urban accessibility"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":"619","title":"Urban accessibility issues: Techno-scientific democratizations at the documentation interface","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988023762&doi=10.1080%2f13604813.2016.1194004&partnerID=40&md5=d9e00719aa273a5516929f04ad2fd286","volume":"20","year":"2016","author_address":"Munich Center for Technology in Society & Department of Architecture, TU M\u00fcnchen, Germany","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :3","Export Date: 18 February 2021"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Routledge","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"City","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":230,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos501-973.ciw"],"abstract":"In 1this paper we investigate produsage using Actor-Network Theory with a focus on (produsage) skills, their development, and transformation. We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption\/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating. \u00a9 2011 Taylor & Francis.","alternate_title1":"New Rev Hypermedia Multimedia","authors":["De Paoli, S.","Storni, C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1080\/13614568.2011.552641","end_page":"52","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"13614568 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Actor-network","Circulation","Produsage","Relationality","Skills","Symmetry","Actor-network","Circulation","Produsage","Relationality","Skills","Symmetry"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"31","title":"Produsage in hybrid networks: Sociotechnical skills in the case of Arduino","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953330803&doi=10.1080%2f13614568.2011.552641&partnerID=40&md5=9bad7de5e0dfb3e6c78e4c2edee1c2a9","volume":"17","year":"2011","author_address":"[Storni, Cristiano] Univ Limerick, Interact Design Ctr, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Limerick, Ireland.

To preserve this investment, attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware\/software. The Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open hardware\/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil infrastructure applications. \u00a9 2006 Imperial College Press.","alternate_title1":"J.

Many of these open source ventilator projects have adopted an open-when-finished model due to legitimate legal and liability concerns. This, however, has led to a proliferation of projects with teams across the world independently designing over a hundred mutually incompatible ventilators, representing a huge amount of duplicated effort. A functioning design is necessary but not sufficient for a project to help patients. The device must be taken through regulatory approval by a manufacturer that understands why design decisions were taken. In this article we argue that the open design process developed for Open Source Software can be used for Open Source Hardware.

In this regard, a new WC model is proposed to simultaneously accommodate these distinct and essential features. In this open-source hardware project, the design, analysis and fabrication of a new active commode WC for indoor applications are performed. Materials and method: A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design. Results: The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access. Conclusion: The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.Implications for rehabilitation The expected outcomes and implications of the current commode WC project with regard to rehabilitation purpose are enlisted below: In the present scenario, a WC user is heavily dependent on external assistance to access private spaces in general and toilets in particular. The introduced model is capable to address this shortcoming by enabling the user to access the toilet utility directly by self propelling. Indeed, for a person with locomotor disability, a WC is the natural extension of his physical body. Thereby, this multipurpose commode WC design offers much Independence and greater flexibility to the indoor movements. The proposed design instils confidence to a WC user to access and transfer between facilities by means of self effort. Consequently it is expected to improve the quality of one\u2019s personal life significantly. Importantly, this is an open-source project, those who are interested in rehabilitation motives can modify the present design to suit their local requirements especially in resource-limited settings. \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alternate_title1":"Disabil.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research. \u00a9 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","alternate_title1":"J.

However, many hurdles still exist before these techniques can be used in research laboratories for cellular and molecular biology applications. Extrusion-based bioprinting systems have been characterized by high development costs, injector clogging, difficulty achieving small cell number deposits, decreased cell viability, and altered cell function post-printing. To circumvent the high-price barrier to entry of conventional bioprinters, we designed and 3D printed components for the adaptation of an inexpensive 'off-the-shelf' commercially available 3D printer. We also demonstrate via goal based computer simulations that the needle geometries of conventional commercially standardized, 'luer-lock' syringe-needle systems cause many of the issues plaguing conventional bioprinters. To address these performance limitations we optimized flow within several microneedle geometries, which revealed a short tapered injector design with minimal cylindrical needle length was ideal to minimize cell strain and accretion. We then experimentally quantified these geometries using pulled glass microcapillary pipettes and our modified, low-cost 3D printer. This systems performance validated our models exhibiting: reduced clogging, single cell print resolution, and maintenance of cell viability without the use of a sacrificial vehicle. Using this system we show the successful printing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into Geltrex and note their retention of a pluripotent state 7 d post printing. We also show embryoid body differentiation of hiPSC by injection into differentiation conducive environments, wherein we observed continuous growth, emergence of various evaginations, and post-printing gene expression indicative of the presence of all three germ layers. These data demonstrate an accessible open-source 3D bioprinter capable of serving the needs of any laboratory interested in 3D cellular interactions and tissue engineering. \u00a9 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","alternate_title1":"Biofabrication","authors":["Reid, J.A.","Mollica, P.A.","Johnson, G.D.","Ogle, R.C.","Bruno, R.D.","Sachs, P.C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1088\/1758-5090\/8\/2\/025017","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"17585082 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D differentiation","3D printing","bioprinting","induced pluripotent stem cells","open labware","tissue engineering","3D printers","Computer aided design","Costs","Cytology","Gene expression","Geometry","Molecular biology","Needles","Printing presses","Research laboratories","Stem cells","Tissue","Tissue engineering","3-D printing","Bioprinting","Cellular interaction","Human-induced pluripotent stem cells","Induced pluripotent stem cells","open labware","Performance limitations","Stem cell differentiation","Cell engineering","animal","bioprinting","cell differentiation","cell survival","chemistry","cytology","devices","economics","evaluation study","human","induced pluripotent stem cell","procedures","rat","three dimensional printing","tissue engineering","tissue scaffold","Animals","Bioprinting","Cell Differentiation","Cell Survival","Humans","Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","Printing, Three-Dimensional","Rats","Tissue Engineering","Tissue Scaffolds"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"2","start_page":null,"title":"Accessible bioprinting: Adaptation of a low-cost 3D-printer for precise cell placement and stem cell differentiation","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987723045&doi=10.1088%2f1758-5090%2f8%2f2%2f025017&partnerID=40&md5=b754e553111ad257b09b17e782d03614","volume":"8","year":"2016","author_address":"[Reid, John A.; Johnson, Garett D.] Old Dominion Univ, Biomed Engn Program, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.

Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion\/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion\/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering. \u00a9 Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","alternate_title1":"Tissue Eng.

Opensource and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how \"operational pragmatics\" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

Each of the six network centres is capable of operating the network alone. Most of the used hardware and software have been developed in-house under open-source license. Short development cycles and close cooperation between developers and users ensure robustness, transparency and fast maintenance procedures, thus avoiding unnecessary complex solutions. This also reduces the overall costs of the network operation. An easy-to-expand web interface has been developed to make the complete system available to other interested network operators in order to increase cooperation between different countries.

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science. \u00a9 The Author 2015.","alternate_title1":"Sci.

Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters\u2014photosystem II quantum yield (\u03a6II), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others\u2014 and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https:\/\/photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.","alternate_title1":"R.

One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index\/OPL. Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences are suggested. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.","alternate_title1":"R. Soc.

As a consequence, the user may not have the ability to adapt a microscope to their specific needs and limitations in experimental design are introduced. A flexible work-horse microscopy system is a valuable tool in any laboratory to meet the diverse needs of a research team and promote innovation in experimental design. We have developed the Flexiscope; a multi-functional, adaptable, efficient and high-performance microscopy\/electrophysiology system for everyday applications in a neurobiology laboratory. The core optical components are relatively constant in the three configurations described here: an upright configuration, an inverted configuration and an upright\/electrophysiology configuration. We have provided a comprehensive description of the Flexiscope. We show that this method is capable of oblique infrared illumination imaging, multi-channel fluorescent imaging and automated three-dimensional scanning of larger specimens. Image quality is conserved across the three configurations of the microscope, and conversion between configurations is possible quickly and easily, while the motion control system can be repurposed to allow sub-micrometre computer-controlled micromanipulation. The Flexiscope provides similar performance and usability to commercially available systems. However, as it can be easily reconfigured for multiple roles, it can remove the need to purchase multiple microscopes, giving significant cost savings. The modular reconfigurable nature allows the user to customize the system to their specific needs and adapt\/upgrade the system as challenges arise, without requiring specialized technical skills. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

This paper aims to present a mobile platform, named \u201cCARTON\u201d, which transforms a smartphone into smart eyewear, following a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach. This platform is composed of three main components: a blueprint to build the hardware prototype with very simple materials and regular tools; a software development kit (SDK) to help with the development of new applications (e.g. augmented reality app); and, finally, a second SDK (ControlWear) to interact with mobile applications through a Smartwatch. Design\/methodology\/approach: User experiments were conducted, in which participants were asked to create, by themselves, the CARTON\u2019s hardware part and perform usability tests with their own creation. A second round of experimentation was conducted to evaluate three different interaction modalities. Findings: Qualitative user feedback and quantitative results prove that CARTON is functional and feasible to anyone, without specific skills. The results also showed that ControlWear had the most positive results, compared with the other interaction modalities, and that user interaction preference would vary depending on the task. Originality\/value: The authors describe a novel way to create a smart eyewear available for a wide audience around the world. By providing everything open-source and open-hardware, they intend to solve the reachability of technologies related to smart eyewear and aim to accelerate research around it. \u00a9 2017, \u00a9 Emerald Publishing Limited.","alternate_title1":"Int.

Design\/methodology\/approach - This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process. Findings - As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education. Research limitations\/implications - There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models. Originality\/value - The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Cota, VR","Aguiar, CL","Neto, BD","Benegas, M"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1108\/INMR-06-2018-0036","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2515-8961","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Open-source hardware as a model of technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship The Brazilian landscape","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"17","year":"2020","author_address":"[Cota, Vinicius Rosa] Univ Fed Sao Joao Del Rei, Lab Interdisciplinar Neuroengn & Neurociencias, Dept Engn Eletr, Sao Joao Del Rei, Brazil.

The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process. Design\/methodology\/approach: The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report. Findings: The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time. Research limitations\/implications: There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction. Practical implications: Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices. Originality\/value: The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments. Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","alternate_title1":"Ind.

Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design\/methodology\/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.

Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design\/methodology\/approach: The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings: The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations\/implications: The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications: The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications: The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality\/value: The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","alternate_title1":"Rapid Prototyping J.","authors":["Calderon, A.","Griffin, J.","Zagal, J.C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1108\/RPJ-01-2013-0006","end_page":"255","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"13552546 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["CAD","Innovation","Manufacturing systems","Rapid prototypes","3D printers","Ability testing","Computer aided design","Computer hardware","Cost reduction","Developing countries","Hardware","Innovation","Manufacture","Open source software","Printing","Rapid prototyping","Design\/methodology\/approach","Digital manufacturing","High resolution","Means of productions","Personal fabrication","Printing quality","Revolutionary technology","Social implication","Printing presses"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"245","title":"BeamMaker: An open hardware high-resolution digital fabricator for the masses","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901017027&doi=10.1108%2fRPJ-01-2013-0006&partnerID=40&md5=41b1a65786a562276732649f634eac65","volume":"20","year":"2014","author_address":"[Calderon, Ariel; Griffin, James; Cristobal Zagal, Juan] Univ Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Santiago, Chile.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"17111237","notes":["Cited By :11","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: RPJOF","Correspondence Address: Zagal, J.C.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; email: jczagal@ing.uchile.cl"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Rapid Prototyping Journal","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000340950200009","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Calderon, Ariel Griffin, James Cristobal Zagal, Juan","author_keywords":"Innovation; Manufacturing systems; CAD; Rapid prototypes","beginning_page":"245","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"17","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"AN9SY","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"1758-7670","email_address":"jczagal@ing.uchile.cl","ending_page":"255","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"Fondecyt ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11110353]","funding_text":"The authors acknowledge funding provided from Fondecyt Chile project number 11110353.","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Rapid Prototyping J.","issue":"3","keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":"Green Published","orcid_id":"Zagal, Juan Cristobal\/0000-0002-2710-7604; Calderon, Ariel Alejandro\/0000-0002-7854-6543; Griffin, James\/0000-0002-9179-5130","page_count":"11","part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":"RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","publisher_city":"BINGLEY","pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":"Zagal, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Santiago, Chile.","research_areas":"Engineering; Materials Science","researcher_id":"Zagal, Juan Cristobal\/F-5036-2016; Calderon, Ariel Alejandro\/AAA-9472-2020; Griffin, James\/H-9512-2013","source_abbreviation_29c":"RAPID PROTOTYPING J","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"11","usage_count_180":"1","usage_count_2013":"26","wos_categories":"Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"11"},{"index":262,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a solution for the levelling plate of fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) systems.

However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive nished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a 2000 open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided.

The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I\/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I\/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I\/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Lee, Y.S.","Jo, B.","Han, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2017.2715184","end_page":"11130","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino due","block libraries","high-speed USB interface","rapid control prototyping (RCP)","C (programming language)","Computer control systems","Computer hardware","Computer software portability","Control systems","Data transfer","Hardware","Open source software","Real time systems","Software packages","Standards","Tools","Arduino Due","Block libraries","High speed usb interfaces","Open-source hardwares","Rapid control prototyping","Universal serial bus","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"11118","title":"A Light-Weight Rapid Control Prototyping System Based on Open Source Hardware","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021799940&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2017.2715184&partnerID=40&md5=09afef3ba37618b5443854c35fb75e29","volume":"5","year":"2017","author_address":"[Lee, Young Sam; Jo, Bongeon] Inha Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Chen, L.-J.","Ho, Y.-H.","Lee, H.-C.","Wu, H.-C.","Liu, H.-M.","Hsieh, H.-H.","Huang, Y.-T.","Lung, S.-C.C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2017.2723919","end_page":"14454","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Air pollution","crowdsourcing","environmental monitoring","Internet of Things","Air pollution","Computer hardware","Diseases","Hardware","Monitoring","Open source software","Pollution","Sensors","Smart city","Software engineering","Atmospheric model","Environmental awareness","Fine particulate matter","Government authorities","Lungs","Number of datum","Open system architecture","Particle sensors","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"14441","title":"An Open Framework for Participatory PM2.5 Monitoring in Smart Cities","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023185030&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2017.2723919&partnerID=40&md5=ae7a4b94de4a663a81199bb5ff1341b3","volume":"5","year":"2017","author_address":"[Chen, Ling-Jyh; Lee, Hu-Cheng; Liu, Hao-Min; Hsieh, Hsin-Hung; Huang, Yu-Te] Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.

The function of the 360 degrees panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment. Fish recognition is based on deep learning, which is the biggest topic in the artificial intelligence research field today.

As a main control unit, we use a Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance, and occupies a small space.

In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["G\u00fcrkan, G.","G\u00fcrkan, K."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2914958","end_page":"58779","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["bright-field microscopy","image stitching","live-cell imaging","Open-hardware","time-lapse imaging","Budget control","Cell culture","Computer hardware description languages","Costs","Mammals","Bright-field microscopy","Image stitching","Live-cell imaging","Open hardware","Time-lapse imaging","Cells"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"58764","title":"Incu-Stream 1.0: An Open-Hardware Live-Cell Imaging System Based on Inverted Bright-Field Microscopy and Automated Mechanical Scanning for Real-Time and Long-Term Imaging of Microplates in Incubator","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065869545&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2914958&partnerID=40&md5=19203345ba758c2de43b75a9584ea8e1","volume":"7","year":"2019","author_address":"[Gurkan, Guray] Istanbul Kultur Univ, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Atakoy Campus, TR-34156 Istanbul, Turkey.

The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with\/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Molina-Cantero, A.J.","Lebrato-Vazquez, C.","Merino-Monge, M.","Quesada-Tabares, R.","Castro-Garcia, J.A.","Gomez-Gonzalez, I.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2919324","end_page":"70798","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["AAC","blinks","EEG","EOG","IROG","people with disabilities","VOG","Electroencephalography","Open systems","Video signal processing","Bioelectrical signals","blinks","Brain computer interfaces (BCIs)","Communication technologies","IROG","Open-source hardwares","People with disabilities","Sophisticated system","Brain computer interface"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"70770","title":"Communication technologies based on voluntary blinks: Assessment and design","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067419430&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2919324&partnerID=40&md5=fbeeb355c3e3ebb05ed0a541ec548460","volume":"7","year":"2019","author_address":"[Molina-Cantero, Alberto J.; Lebrato-Vazquez, Clara; Merino-Monge, Manuel; Quesada-Tabares, Roylan; Castro-Garcia, Juan A.; Gomez-Gonzalez, Isabel M.] Univ Seville, ETS Ingn Informat, Dept Elect Technol, E-41012 Seville, Spain.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"8723329","notes":["Cited By :4","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Molina-Cantero, A.J.; Department of Electronic Technology, Spain; email: almolina@us.es"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Access","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000472037100001","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Molina-Cantero, Alberto J.

The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length 'regime-bit' and 'exponent-bit' (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder\/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition\/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Jaiswal, M.K.","So, H.K.-H."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2920936","end_page":"74601","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Adder","ASIC","digital arithmetic","division","floating point arithmetic","FPGA","multiplier","posit arithmetic","subtractor","universal number system","Adders","Application specific integrated circuits","Digital arithmetic","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Numbering systems","Open systems","Pipeline processing systems","Pipelines","division","Hardware solutions","multiplier","Number system","Open-source hardwares","Pipelined architecture","Run-time variations","Subtractor","Computer architecture"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"74586","title":"PACoGen: A Hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068239068&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2920936&partnerID=40&md5=bade0fb49b1945e6376c1e047555c0ef","volume":"7","year":"2019","author_address":"[Jaiswal, Manish Kumar; So, Hayden K-H] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"8731915","notes":["Cited By :7","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Jaiswal, M.K.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hong Kong; email: manishkj@hku.hk"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Access","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000473188000001","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Jaiswal, Manish Kumar So, Hayden K-H","author_keywords":"Adder; ASIC; digital arithmetic; division; floating point arithmetic; FPGA; multiplier; posit arithmetic; subtractor; universal number system","beginning_page":"74586","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"23","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"IF6JW","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":"manishkj@hku.hk","ending_page":"74601","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Project General Research Fund (GRF) [17245716]; Croucher Foundation, Croucher Innovation Award 2013","funding_text":"This work was supported in part by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong Project General Research Fund (GRF) under Grant 17245716, and in part by the Croucher Foundation, Croucher Innovation Award 2013.","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"IEEE Access","issue":null,"keywords_plus":"DIVISION","meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":"DOAJ Gold","orcid_id":"So, Hayden Kwok Hay\/0000-0002-6514-0237","page_count":"16","part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":"IEEE ACCESS","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","publisher_city":"PISCATAWAY","pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":"Jaiswal, MK (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","research_areas":"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","researcher_id":"So, Hayden Kwok Hay\/C-1585-2009","source_abbreviation_29c":"IEEE ACCESS","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"5","usage_count_180":"0","usage_count_2013":"1","wos_categories":"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"5"},{"index":273,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"In power generation systems the synchronization of an alternator with the electrical network are an important and critical task.

The synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive.

Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB\/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and research in this area. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Minati, L.","Movsisyan, V.","McCormick, M.","Gyozalyan, K.","Papazyan, T.","Makaryan, H.","Aldrigo, S.","Harutyunyan, T.","Ghaltaghchyan, H.","McCormick, C.","Fandrich, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2934715","end_page":"112283","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Artificial intelligence","distributed computing","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","hamming distance","high-performance computing","L1-norm","open-source","vector similarity","Artificial intelligence","Computation theory","Computer circuits","Computer graphics","Graphics processing unit","Hamming distance","Image coding","Indexing (materials working)","Integrated circuit design","Logic gates","Memory architecture","Open source software","Open systems","Parallel architectures","Program processors","Semantics","Signal receivers","Software design","Vectors","Commercial applications","Engineered materials","Large-scale research","Massively parallel computing","Multimedia materials","Open-source hardwares","Research institutions","System configurations","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"112269","title":"IFLEX: A Fully Open-Source, High-Density Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Hardware Co-Processor for Vector Similarity Searching","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097280716&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2934715&partnerID=40&md5=de373c8e291ee10c0b0178c8ab184ef2","volume":"7","year":"2019","author_address":"[Minati, Ludovico; Fandrich, Mick] InterMot Technol Inc, Oregon City, OR 97045 USA.

Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost, among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Pisha, L.","Garudadri, H.","Warchall, J.","Zubatiy, T.","Hamilton, S.","Lee, C.-H.","Chockalingam, G.","Mercier, P.P.","Gupta, R.","Rao, B.D."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2951145","end_page":"162101","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["electrophysiology (EEG)","embedded software","field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","Hearing aids (HAs)","Internet of Things","open source hardware","research initiatives","speech processing","system-level design","wearable computers","Application programs","Electroencephalography","Electrophysiology","Embedded software","Embedded systems","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Firmware","Health care","Hearing aids","Internet of things","Open source software","Open systems","Signal processing","Speech intelligibility","Speech processing","Systems analysis","Wearable computers","Acoustical environments","Embedded processors","Hearing researches","Open source platforms","Open-source hardwares","Proprietary development","Research initiatives","System level design","Audition"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"162083","title":"A Wearable, Extensible, Open-Source Platform for Hearing Healthcare Research","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077796104&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2951145&partnerID=40&md5=5e3e4b3ae1d8845ff961f380e22adc0f","volume":"7","year":"2019","author_address":"[Pisha, Louis; Lee, Ching-Hua; Mercier, Patrick P.; Rao, Bhaskar D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.

First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Chung, W.","Giri, D.K.","Son, H."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2956190","end_page":"173558","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Finite-time control","sliding-mode control (SMC)","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Aircraft detection","Antennas","Attitude control","Controllers","Open systems","Sliding mode control","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Asymptotically stable","External disturbances","Finite-time control","Finite-time convergence","Lyapunov stability theorem","Open-source hardwares","Steady-state response","Tracking performance","Aircraft control"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"173549","title":"Finite-Time Control of Multirotor UAVs under Disturbances","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078054394&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2956190&partnerID=40&md5=238a2869ec299c32d4441fc073dee0cd","volume":"7","year":"2019","author_address":"[Chung, Wonmo; Son, Hungsun] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Aerosp & Nucl Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.

There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and\/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and\/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Sanchez-Herrera, R.","Marquez, M.A.","Andujar, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2020.2965639","end_page":"10442","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["cloud","data acquisition","EJS\/EJSS","Industrial Internet of Things","Industry 40","Internet-of-Things","Modbus","open source hardware\/software","remote access","Actuators","Clouds","Data acquisition","Internet of things","Open source software","Remote sensing","Transmission control protocol","Configuration and managements","EJS\/EJSS","Modbus","Open-source hardwares","Operational technologies","Remote access","Sensors and actuators","Transmission control protocol\/internet protocols","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"10433","title":"Easy and Secure Handling of Sensors and Actuators as Cloud-Based Service","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078728526&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.2965639&partnerID=40&md5=6ec2be0710026cb1540a10f3afd35f7e","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"[Sanchez-Herrera, Reyes; Marquez, Marco A.; Andujar, Jose M.] Huelva Univ, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Huelva 21007, Spain.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"8955897","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Sanchez-Herrera, R.; Huelva University, Spain; email: reyes.sanchez@die.uhu.es"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Access","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000525404800007","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Sanchez-Herrera, Reyes Marquez, Marco A.

When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Choi, D."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2020.2965977","end_page":"14145","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Intelligent actuators","open-source hardware","open-source software","robot control","3D printers","Actuators","Controllers","Cost effectiveness","Intelligent robots","Machine design","Open systems","Position control","Speed control","Speed regulators","Commercial products","Electronic speed controllers","General purpose motors","Intelligent actuator","Open-source hardwares","Position and speed control","Robot controls","Robotic applications","Open source software"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"14134","title":"Development of Open-Source Motor Controller Framework for Robotic Applications","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079797032&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.2965977&partnerID=40&md5=2cf8d642ac1fc33d347271f780958a51","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Myongji University, Seoul, 17058, South Korea","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"8957033","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Choi, D.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, South Korea; email: dongilc@mju.ac.kr"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Access","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000524735300013","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Choi, Dongil","author_keywords":"Intelligent actuators; open-source hardware; open-source software; robot control","beginning_page":"14134","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"32","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"LB6HQ","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":"dongilc@mju.ac.kr","ending_page":"14145","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2019R1G1A1008726]; 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea; Myongji University","funding_text":"This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1G1A1008726), and in part by the 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University. 10.13039\/501100003725-National Research Foundation of Korea and 10.13039\/501100002538-Myongji University.","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"IEEE Access","issue":null,"keywords_plus":"FIELD-ORIENTED CONTROL","meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":"DOAJ Gold","orcid_id":"choe, dong-il\/0000-0002-0566-2922","page_count":"12","part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":"IEEE ACCESS","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","publisher_city":"PISCATAWAY","pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":"Choi, DL (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Seoul 17058, South Korea.","research_areas":"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":"IEEE ACCESS","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"0","usage_count_180":"1","usage_count_2013":"1","wos_categories":"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"0"},{"index":279,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"We propose an open source hardware platform called Blinky, a sound-to-light conversion sensor that harvests sound power at low-rate and conveniently.

Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the entire chain of the HiCCE-128 electrophysiological data acquisition system. The system comprises of 128 independent channels capable of acquiring signal at 31.25 kHz, with 16 effective bits per channel with a measured noise level of about 3\u03bcV. The reliability and feasibility of the implemented system have been confirmed through a series of tests and real-world applications. The modular design methodology based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) standard allows the connection of the HiCCE-128 board to programmable system-on-chip carrier devices through the high-speed FMC link.

Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp\/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp\/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB\/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Access","authors":["Kamaleldin, A.","Hesham, S.","Gohringer, D."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2020.3015706","end_page":"148826","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"21693536 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["field programmable gate array (FPGA)","Many-core architecture","network-on-chip (NoC)","parallel computing","reconfigurable computing","RISC-V","Cluster computing","Cost engineering","Energy efficiency","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Integrated circuit interconnects","Memory architecture","Network-on-chip","Open systems","Architecture configuration","Dynamic and partial reconfiguration","Energy efficient computing","Intra-cluster communication","Multicore architectures","Non recurring engineering","Proposed architectures","System-on-chip architecture","Integrated circuit design"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"148812","title":"Towards a Modular RISC-V Based Many-Core Architecture for FPGA Accelerators","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090293022&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3015706&partnerID=40&md5=c02b817d9ce3cb8637ea7ace82b1dd12","volume":"8","year":"2020","author_address":"[Kamaleldin, Ahmed; Hesham, Salma; Gohringer, Diana] Tech Univ Dresden, Adapt Dynam Syst, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.

However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products.

Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-It-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education.

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Internet Things J.","authors":["Park, J.-H."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/JIOT.2015.2496259","end_page":"230","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"23274662 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["All-terminal reliability","Internet of Things","Point-to-point link networks","Radio broadcast module networks","Reliability analysis","Wireless random mesh networks","Wireless regular networks","Broadcasting","Cost effectiveness","Fading (radio)","Graph theory","Hardware","Internet","Internet of things","Mesh generation","MESH networking","Open source software","Open systems","Radio broadcasting","Radio links","Reconfigurable hardware","Reliability","Reliability theory","Telecommunication networks","Wireless networks","All terminal reliability","Module networks","Point-to-point link","Random meshes","Regular networks","Reliability analysis"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"2","start_page":"219","title":"All-Terminal Reliability Analysis of Wireless Networks of Redundant Radio Modules","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963750665&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2015.2496259&partnerID=40&md5=e719b8d175904696c11715da2c8d006d","volume":"3","year":"2016","author_address":"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Dongjak-Ku, 156-756, South Korea","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"7312886","notes":["Cited By :15","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Park, J.-H.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, South Korea; email: hyunie@cau.ac.kr"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000373148800008","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Park, Jae-Hyun","author_keywords":"All-terminal reliability; Internet of Things; point-to-point link networks; radio-broadcast module networks; reliability analysis; wireless random mesh networks; wireless regular networks","beginning_page":"219","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"23","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"DH9XH","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":"hyunie@cau.ac.kr","ending_page":"230","funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"IEEE Internet Things J.","issue":"2","keywords_plus":"MODEL","meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":"Park, Jae-Hyun\/0000-0003-2616-9907","page_count":"12","part_number":null,"publication_date":"APR","publication_name":"IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","publisher_city":"PISCATAWAY","pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":"Park, JH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea.","research_areas":"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","researcher_id":"Park, Jae-Hyun\/R-6013-2017","source_abbreviation_29c":"IEEE INTERNET THINGS","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"9","usage_count_180":"0","usage_count_2013":"10","wos_categories":"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"9"},{"index":286,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos501-973.ciw"],"abstract":"SENORA is an open hardware and software architecture for the cooperative coordination of multiple heterogeneous mobile robots operating in a common environment.

In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (JJ Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them. \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Sensors J.","authors":["Santos, O.C.","Uria-Rivas, R.","Rodriguez-Sanchez, M.C.","Boticario, J.G."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/JSEN.2016.2533266","end_page":"3874","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"1530437X (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["affective computing","emotion recognition","sensor systems","Data handling","Physiology","Signal processing","Affective Computing","Ambient intelligence","Ambient intelligent","Educational activities","Educational settings","Emotion recognition","Physiological signals","Sensor systems","Learning systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"10","start_page":"3865","title":"An Open Sensing and Acting Platform for Context-Aware Affective Support in Ambient Intelligent Educational Settings","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963894139&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2016.2533266&partnerID=40&md5=c3ca1f8668ddfd67a0daec7bc042ae24","volume":"16","year":"2016","author_address":"[Santos, Olga C.; Uria-Rivas, Raul; Boticario, Jesus G.] UNED, Dept Artificial Intelligence, aDeNu Res Grp, Madrid 28040, Spain.

This concept harnesses the flexibility of software-defined hardware to implement optoelectronic systems which can be configured to adapt to multiple high speed optical engineering applications. As an application example, a software-defined optical interferometer using a commercial software-defined radio platform is built. The system is tested by performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic signals in a concentrated dye solution. Using software modifications only, conventional single carrier and also multicarrier heterodyne techniques with space and frequency diversity are performed. The latter technique shows a noticeable performance improvement in single-shot interferometric measurements. \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Sensors J.","authors":["Riobo, L.M.","Veiras, F.E.","Garea, M.T.","Sorichetti, P.A."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/JSEN.2018.2842143","end_page":"5760","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"1530437X (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["interferometry","open source hardware","Optoelectronic devices","photoacoustic effects","signal processing algorithms","software-defined hardware","Application programs","Digital devices","Hardware","Heterodyning","Interferometry","Laser beam effects","Laser beams","Modulation","Open source software","Open systems","Optical sensors","Optoelectronic devices","Photoacoustic effect","Open-source hardwares","Optical diffractions","Optical interferometry","Optical mixing","Signal processing algorithms","Synchronous digital hierarchy","Software radio"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"14","start_page":"5753","title":"Software-defined optoelectronics: Space and frequency diversity in heterodyne interferometry","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047810726&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2018.2842143&partnerID=40&md5=52874922eb507dfe939d46ac648cd573","volume":"18","year":"2018","author_address":"[Riobo, Lucas M.; Veiras, Francisco E.; Garea, Maria T.; Sorichetti, Patricio A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ingn, Dept Fis, GLOmAe, RA-1063 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.

These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this paper intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems. RaspMI is an open-source hardware and software system that is controlled by a graphical user interface developed by using the MonoDevelop cross-platform and C# programming language. This system has many features such as 72 dB dynamic range, 100 Hz sampling frequency, timer recording mode, text and SAC data file format, and latitude, longitude, date and time support with GPS module. RaspMI has subjected to the various tests in terms of the reliability and sensitivity. The obtained results have shown that RaspMI can be used as an alternative instrument for seismic ambient noise measurements.

High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations. \u00a9 2007-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Syst.

State of art equipment for stiffness evaluation are expensive, require expertise to operate and not amenable for field deployment. In this context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The accuracy of results was verified with the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS measurement and sitting\/supine postures for imaging system was also investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE J.

Worse, these errors can prevent wireless reprogramming, resulting in longer delays and costly human interventions. This letter describes shoulder angel - an ultra-low-power, low-cost, open hardware and software platform that ensures users can always recover and reprogram wireless sensors, in spite of software errors. Shoulder angel uses a physically separate coprocessor to monitor a device's power consumption and other behaviors, while keeping the device in a reprogrammable state. Our results show that shoulder angel is able to recover from otherwise fatal software errors while incurring an energy overhead of only 7\u03bcW. \u00a9 2009-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Emded.

ADA consists of off-The-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware. It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks.We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Robot.

In this work, we address the design, control, estimation, and planning problems for cooperative localization, grasping, and transportation of objects in challenging outdoor scenarios. We demonstrate an autonomous team of MAVs able to plan safe trajectories for manipulation of ferrous objects, while guaranteeing interrobot collision avoidance and automatically creating a map of the objects in the environment. Our solution is predominantly distributed, allowing the team to pick and transport ferrous disks to a final destination without collisions. This result is achieved using a new magnetic gripper with a novel feedback approach, enabling the detection of successful grasping. The gripper design and all the components to build a platform are clearly provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the proposed solution is validated through experimental results, where difficulties include inconsistent wind, uneven terrain, and sandy conditions. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Robot.

However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Robot.

It supports a wide variety of data formats, algorithms, and rendering techniques for both polygonal and volumetric data. In particular, VTK's volume rendering module has long provided a comprehensive set of features such as plane clipping, color and opacity transfer functions, lighting, and other controls needed for visualization. However, due to VTK's legacy OpenGL backend and its reliance on a deprecated API, the system did not take advantage of the latest improvements in graphics hardware or the flexibility of a programmable pipeline. Additionally, this dependence on an antiquated pipeline posed restrictions when running on emerging computing platforms, thereby limiting its overall applicability. In response to these shortcomings, the VTK community developed a new and improved volume rendering module, which not only provides a modern graphics processing unit-based implementation, but also augments its capabilities with new features such as fast volume clipping, gradient-magnitude-based opacity modulation, render to texture, and hardware-based volume picking. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Comput Graphics Appl","authors":["Chaudhary, A.","Jhaveri, S.J.","Sanchez, A.","Avila, L.S.","Martin, K.M.","Vacanti, A.","Hanwell, M.D.","Schroeder, W."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/MCG.2018.2880818","end_page":"43","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"02721716 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Application programming interfaces (API)","Data handling","Graphics processing unit","Opacity","Open systems","Pipelines","Program processors","Textures","Visualization","Volume rendering","Volumetric analysis","Gradient magnitude","Graphics processing","Hardware-accelerated","Medical data visualization","Medical visualization","Opacity transfer functions","Programmable shaders","Visualization toolkits","Data visualization","algorithm","computer assisted diagnosis","computer graphics","diagnostic imaging","human","image processing","software","tooth","trunk","Algorithms","Computer Graphics","Diagnostic Imaging","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Software","Tooth","Torso"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"26","title":"Cross-Platform Ubiquitous Volume Rendering Using Programmable Shaders in VTK for Scientific and Medical Visualization: Open Source, Hardware Accelerated Ray Casting","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062857916&doi=10.1109%2fMCG.2018.2880818&partnerID=40&md5=088e8befc2adbb900bdc2ab303328c30","volume":"39","year":"2019","author_address":"Kitware, Inc., Clifton Park, NY, United States","custom2":"30869596","custom3":null,"custom7":"8663650","notes":["Cited By :2","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: ICGAD"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":301,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"Editor's note: This article presents an open-source platform for wearable health monitoring.

Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers. \u00a9 1981-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Micro","authors":["Beamer, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/MM.2020.2997639","end_page":"119","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"02721732 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Open systems","Simulators","Commercial simulators","Design process","Hardware design","Hardware performance counters","Open-source hardwares","Rtl simulations","Simulation speed","Software simulation","Open source software"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":"112","title":"A Case for Accelerating Software RTL Simulation","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085759424&doi=10.1109%2fMM.2020.2997639&partnerID=40&md5=c0ca150b7b9fd798be999f0926579d36","volume":"40","year":"2020","author_address":"[Beamer, Scott] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Comp Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"9099598","notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: IEMID","Correspondence Address: Beamer, S.; University of CaliforniaUnited States; email: sbeamer@ucsc.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Micro","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000545423800013","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Beamer, Scott","author_keywords":"Open source software; Hardware; Optimization; Computational modeling; Generators; Acceleration","beginning_page":"112","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"12","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"MF6AX","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"1937-4143","email_address":"sbeamer@ucsc.edu","ending_page":"119","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"Army Research LaboratoryUnited States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL); Army Research Office [W911NF1910466]","funding_text":"This work was supported in part by the Army Research Laboratory and in part by the Army Research Office under Contract\/Grant W911NF1910466.","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"IEEE Micro","issue":"4","keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":"8","part_number":null,"publication_date":"JUL-AUG","publication_name":"IEEE MICRO","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","publisher_city":"LOS ALAMITOS","pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":"Beamer, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Comp Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.","research_areas":"Computer Science","researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":"IEEE MICRO","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"0","usage_count_180":"0","usage_count_2013":"0","wos_categories":"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"0"},{"index":308,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"For five years, OpenPiton has provided hardware designs, build and verification scripts, and other infrastructure to enable efficient, detailed research into manycores and systems-on-chip.

Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardwarebased networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks. \u00a9 1986-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Network","authors":["Forconesi, M.","Sutter, G.","Lopez-Buedo, S.","Lopez De Vergara, J.E.","Aracil, J."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/MNET.2014.6915434","end_page":"19","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"08908044 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Hardware and software","Open-source network"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"5","start_page":"13","title":"Bridging the gap between hardware and software open source network developments","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907937823&doi=10.1109%2fMNET.2014.6915434&partnerID=40&md5=12411f0b377a0a132b08725040e5e312","volume":"28","year":"2014","author_address":"[Forconesi, Marco] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Networks & Operating Syst Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.

Mobile robots give access to a wide range of fields, such as complex mechanics, sensors, wireless transmission, mathematics, and computer science. However, despite their potential as educational tools, robots are still not as widespread in schools as they could be. In this article, we identify five key reasons: lack of diversity, high cost, noninclusive design, lack of educational material, and lack of stability over time. Then, we describe our answers to these problems, as we implemented them in the Thymio project: a mature mass-produced open-hardware robot, at a low price, with a multiage and gender-neutral feature set, and with a design promoting creativity, facilitating learning, and providing a wide range of interaction possibilities from built-in behaviors to text programming, passing through different visual programming environments. We highlight some neglected key issues that differentiate open-source hardware from open-source software, for instance the legal uncertainty of designing open hardware using professional computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the difficulty to distribute the development. Our solution to these being to increase the awareness of CAD editors to open-source hardware and to provide a two-layer development model for hardware. \u00a9 1994-2011 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Rob Autom Mag","authors":["Mondada, F.","Bonani, M.","Riedo, F.","Briod, M.","Pereyre, L.","Retornaz, P.","Magnenat, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/MRA.2016.2636372","end_page":"85","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"10709932 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Behavioral research","Computer aided design","Computer programming","Education","Educational robots","Hardware","Laws and legislation","Machine design","Mobile robots","Open source software","Open systems","Robot programming","Robotics","Robots","Software engineering","Computer aided design tools","Development model","Educational materials","Educational tools","Open-source hardwares","Robotics technology","Visual programming environments","Wireless transmissions","Computer hardware"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"77","title":"Bringing Robotics to Formal Education: The Thymio Open-Source Hardware Robot","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013649120&doi=10.1109%2fMRA.2016.2636372&partnerID=40&md5=585f424408eb09bac3f0849ea1ee419f","volume":"24","year":"2017","author_address":"Laboratoire de Systemes Robotiques, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"7859350","notes":["Cited By :43","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: IRAME"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":312,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"One of the chief obstacles in achieving wider acceptance of robotics is that only experienced roboticists can develop robotics applications.

Open source systems have already revolutionized a number of industries by empowering end users to contribute to the products that they need and want and by fueling grass-roots development and continual improvement of projects in completely new areas. While there have been innumerable successes in software and electronics hardware, open mechanical hardware is taking longer to catch on. There are a number of likely reasons for this, including the complexity, expense, and time associated with fabricating mechanical components as well as the challenge and reliability of assembling the wide range of mechanical and electronic components required to produce a fully functional system. In comparison with open-source software efforts, open hardware has numerous additional practical challenges associated with dissemination and evolution of the product driven by end users. However, rapid fabrication technologies have improved to the point of being able to produce parts that are strong, robust, and precise enough for practical robotic systems, and the pricing of the systems and supplies have lowered to the point that many of these machines are available in fabrication facilities at most universities. \u00a9 1994-2011 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Rob Autom Mag","authors":["Dollar, A.","Mondada, F.","Rodriguez, A.","Metta, G."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/MRA.2016.2646068","end_page":"31","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"10709932 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"30","title":"Open-Source and Widely Disseminated Robot Hardware [From the Guest Editors]","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016625042&doi=10.1109%2fMRA.2016.2646068&partnerID=40&md5=c47da329b9eda6325c5a18d546d2f362","volume":"24","year":"2017","author_address":null,"custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"7886405","notes":["Cited By :1","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: IRAME"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Editorial","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":314,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"This article discusses an open-hardware robotics kit approach for designing spatial haptic interfaces.

You might guess the reason to be simple-such companies must be set up and run by idealists who lack any hardheaded business sense. Not true! What's held back the opensource hardware movement is not a lack of business acumen; it's the rapid evolution of electronic technology. The reasons for this are subtle, but as I will explain below, swift advances in electronic technology inherently favor large closed businesses at the expense of small teams or individual innovators, who benefit most by working with open systems.

In this paper, we propose an I\u03bcTOA-fusion-based platform to solve this problem. Firstly, Time-of-arrival (TOA)-based distance ranging method is considered to compensate for the drifting errors and accumulation introduced by inertial sensors. Secondly, a geometrical kinematic model and maximum correntropy criterion (MCC)-based Kalman filter method are proposed to fuse the multiple information. The open-source hardware and software are detailed in this paper for real-time human motion capture and reconstruction applications. Experiment results show that our proposed hardware can be easily equipped for total body motion reconstruction with a considerable enhancement of the wear-ability and comfort. Furthermore, the main achievements have been presented with a performance comparison between the proposed platform and state-of-the-art commercial ones. Above all, our proposed platform can significantly suppress the accumulative error and drifting problem of conventional inertial systems.

ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC\/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in the FPGA by storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans Appl Supercond","authors":["Madden, T.J.","Cecil, T.W.","Gades, L.M.","Quaranta, O.","Yan, D.","Miceli, A.","Becker, D.T.","Bennett, D.A.","Hays-Wehle, J.P.","Hilton, G.C.","Gard, J.D.","Mates, J.A.B.","Reintsema, C.D.","Schmidt, D.R.","Swetz, D.S.","Vale, L.R.","Ullom, J.N."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/TASC.2017.2650903","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"10518223 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["firmware","FPGA","microwave multiplexing","ROACH","superconducting detectors","superconducting microcalorimeters","TES","C++ (programming language)","Calorimeters","Computer operating systems","Computer programming","Computer software","Data handling","Ethernet","Firmware","Hardware","Linux","Microwaves","Mixing","Multiplexing","Multiplexing equipment","Open source software","Open systems","Signal processing","Static random access storage","Table lookup","Tellurium","Fiber-optic interfaces","First in first outs","Micro-calorimeters","Open-source hardwares","Phase accumulators","Polyphase filter banks","ROACH","Superconducting detector","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":null,"title":"Development of ROACH Firmware for Microwave Multiplexed X-Ray TES Microcalorimeters","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014891308&doi=10.1109%2fTASC.2017.2650903&partnerID=40&md5=9e87ce88f0c4ec524c2a33bb83149c25","volume":"27","year":"2017","author_address":"[Madden, Timothy J.; Cecil, Thomas W.; Gades, Lisa M.; Quaranta, Orlando; Yan, Daikang; Miceli, Antonino] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.

Creamino is capable of processing multiple EEG channels in real-time and operates under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X in real-time on a standard PC. Its objective is to provide a system that can be readily fabricated and used for neurophysiological experiments and, at the same time, can serve as the basis for development of novel BCI platforms by accessing and modifying its open source hardware and software libraries. Schematics, gerber files, bill of materials, source code, software modules, demonstration videos, and instructions on how to use these modules are available free of charge for research and educational purposes online at https:\/\/github.com\/ArcesUnibo\/creamino. Application cases show how the system can be used for neuroscientific or BCI experiments.

Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans Comput Aided Des Integr Circuits Syst","authors":["Guo, Q.","Chen, T.","Chen, Y.","Wang, R.","Chen, H.","Hu, W.","Chen, G."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/TCAD.2013.2288688","end_page":"463","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"02780070 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Bug forecast","code review","design characteristics","functional verification","machine learning","Code review","Computational resources","Critical issues","Design characteristics","Functional verification","Learning techniques","Machine learning techniques","Open-source hardwares","Design","Hardware","Learning algorithms","Learning systems","Silicon","Forecasting"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"451","title":"Pre-silicon bug forecast","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897641299&doi=10.1109%2fTCAD.2013.2288688&partnerID=40&md5=f2802073fc8caa28c47a76501efb450d","volume":"33","year":"2014","author_address":"[Guo, Qi; Chen, Tianshi; Chen, Yunji; Hu, Weiwu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, State Key Lab Comp Architecture, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.

To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software equivalent.

In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the \"Arduino\" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context. \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans Educ","authors":["Rodriguez-Sanchez, M.C.","Torrado-Carvajal, A.","Vaquero, J.","Borromeo, S.","Hernandez-Tamames, J.A."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/TE.2016.2526676","end_page":"254","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"00189359 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Cooperative\/collaborative learning","engineering education","IEC 61160","innovation","open-source hardware","open-source software","teaching strategies","Curricula","Domestic appliances","Embedded systems","Open systems","Problem solving","Software engineering","Students","Teaching","Wireless telecommunication systems","Academic achievements","Collaborative learning","Industrial environments","Industry requirements","Information communication technology","Open-source hardwares","Project based learning","Wireless communications","Open source software"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":"248","title":"An Embedded Systems Course for Engineering Students Using Open-Source Platforms in Wireless Scenarios","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960172704&doi=10.1109%2fTE.2016.2526676&partnerID=40&md5=74a6594e5cbaa8c6d7eb9e11900f14fc","volume":"59","year":"2016","author_address":"[Rodriguez-Sanchez, M.

Solutions that permit cheap and rapid conversion of courses to remote environments seem to be of high value, especially when social distancing renders direct teaching impossible. Intended Outcomes: Demonstration of a flexible and cheap architecture that permits rapid transformation of digital circuits laboratories to the remote environment. Validation of system's performance and usefulness on a large group of students. Application Design: Remote digital circuits laboratories from the literature are designed to complement stationary classes. For successful teaching during pandemic, a low-cost, flexible, and efficient solution to online laboratory based on commonly available technologies is required. Findings: The proposed remote laboratory architecture enables rapid conversion of on-site teaching to online model, while supporting in-situ upgrades and functionality enhancements.

The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literature without specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator. \u00a9 2005-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans.

Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are presented, which was mainly constructed from conventional instruments and components. This switched architecture system is similar to commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US$ 50000). The sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers, which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this \"open-hardware\"project, the hardware design and software components are openly available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the MIMO measurement capability.

The system is composed of a control center (CC) and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans. Instrum.

A need has been identified for an open-source alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the university researcher and for enabling the development of new synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility. A new modularized architecture for the OpenPMU is presented using an open messaging format which the authors propose is adopted as a platform for PMU research. \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans.

This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i.e., 50\/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated. Interoperability and data exchange with other systems is achieved by use of open schemas and communication protocols. This allows rapid integration with popular numerical simulation environments. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans. Instrum.

This, coupled with the availability of free and open software development tools, opens up great possibilities for developing countries as they are not large capital investments needed for the conception, design, and manufacture of these systems. However, currently very few universities offer courses for building the skills necessary to achieve a marketable product, increasing dependence on Asian technology.

Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans Nucl Sci","authors":["Abu-Nimeh, F.T.","Ito, J.","Moses, W.W.","Peng, Q.","Choong, W.-S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/TNS.2015.2499600","end_page":"629","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"00189499 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Electronics","Instrumentation","Nuclear imaging","Open source hardware","Open source software","Application programs","Computer workstations","Data acquisition","Electronic equipment","Firmware","Hardware","Information dissemination","Medical imaging","Open source software","Radiation detectors","Signal processing","High-performance platforms","Homeland security applications","Instrumentation","Multichannel data","Multiple channels","Nuclear imaging","Open-source hardwares","System configurations","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"2","start_page":"620","title":"Architecture and Implementation of OpenPET Firmware and Embedded Software","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954092278&doi=10.1109%2fTNS.2015.2499600&partnerID=40&md5=4e45494db57a9b658227737abc294c0d","volume":"63","year":"2016","author_address":"[Abu-Nimeh, Faisal T.; Ito, Jennifer; Moses, William W.; Peng, Qiyu; Choong, Woon-Seng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"7378325","notes":["Cited By :1","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: IETNA"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000375028700034","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Abu-Nimeh, Faisal T.

Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However, emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and \u03c0\/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback. \u00a9 1986-2012 IEEE.","alternate_title1":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","authors":["Marzo, A.","Corkett, T.","Drinkwater, B.W."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1109\/TUFFC.2017.2769399","end_page":"111","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"08853010 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Acoustic levitation","airborne","Arduino","open hardware","parametric audio","phased arrays","ultrasonic haptics","ultrasonics","Acoustic fields","Antenna phased arrays","Audio acoustics","Controllers","Hardware","Medical imaging","Real time systems","Ultrasonic transducers","Ultrasonics","Acoustic levitation","airborne","Arduino","Haptics","Open hardware","parametric audio","Application programs"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"102","title":"Ultraino: An Open Phased-Array System for Narrowband Airborne Ultrasound Transmission","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032722793&doi=10.1109%2fTUFFC.2017.2769399&partnerID=40&md5=1564f89a18668718fc8dd2df7e1fe217","volume":"65","year":"2018","author_address":"[Marzo, Asier; Drinkwater, Bruce W.] Univ Bristol, Mech Engn Dept, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England.

Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0102 to 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 CFU\u00a0ml\u22121 22\u201354% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b2-galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.\u00a0coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9\u00a0h compared with 13.5\u00a0h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E.\u00a0coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: \u201cAudioMoth.\u201d The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384\u00a0kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500\u00a0m, extending to 1\u00a0km with continuous recording. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of \u223cUS$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and\/or unreliable. Here, we present \u2018OpenDropOff\u2019, an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n\u00a0=\u00a011), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n\u00a0=\u00a01), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala\u2019s unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4\u00a0km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3\u00b0 and 6.8\u00b0, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Imaging instruments have enabled in situ observations of these organisms that can be automated and are less invasive than traditional sampling methods. However, these instruments are often costly and require sophisticated engineering expertise to operate. The In situ Plankton Assemblage eXplorer (IPAX) is an open-source low-cost imaging platform for zooplankton studies. The IPAX is a programmable instrument that has powerful LED illumination and a high-resolution camera that can image zooplankton in situ, while material costs are less than USD $450. The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100\u00a0\u00b5m features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0cm field of view and 5\u00a0mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs. The IPAX enables economical and autonomous surveys of zooplankton in various aquatic habitats. Its low cost facilitates construction and deployment of multiple units that can cover large spatial areas, while its versatility also allows adaptations to many experimental needs for aquatic ecology. \u00a9 2020 The Author.

Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an environment of continual improvement and open communication. This approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open source microscope stage costs less than 3% to 9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world.","alternate_title1":"J.

Light-sheet microscopy creates a thin sheet of light at a certain depth of field within a volumetric sample. Typically, this configuration involves a pair of orthogonal objectives which constrains the positioning of samples and sample-mounting apparatus in range of the detection objective.

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation. \u00a9 2018 The Authors R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alternate_title1":"R D Manage.","authors":["Hausberg, J.P.","Spaeth, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1111\/radm.12348","end_page":"95","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"00336807 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"75","title":"Why makers make what they make: motivations to contribute to open source hardware development","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057756137&doi=10.1111%2fradm.12348&partnerID=40&md5=87a3df3c344b423815e0df7a93b75255","volume":"50","year":"2020","author_address":"[Hausberg, J.

We describe how the scanner can be used to image interference and diffraction from rectangular single-slit, double-slit, and circular apertures. The experiments are very simple to setup and require no specialized components besides a small laser and a flatbed scanner. Due to the presence of Automatic Gain Control in the scanner, which we were not able to override, we were unable to get an excellent fit to the data. Interestingly, we found that the less-than-ideal data were actually pedagogically superior as it forced the students to think about the process of data acquisition in much greater detail instead of simply performing the experiment mechanically.

Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1%, and the random one was less than 3 \u03bcL.

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits. \u00a9 2017 Copyright is held by the owner\/author(s).

To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGAs, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature codebase reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings. \u00a9 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Physiology research has been critically dependent on cutting-edge technological support of mechanical, electrical, optical, and more recently computer engineers. Evolution of modern experimental equipment is constrained by lack of direct communication between the physiological community and industry producing this equipment. Fortunately, recent advances in open source technologies, including three-dimensional printing, open source hardware and software, present an exciting opportunity to bring the design and development of research instrumentation to the end user, i.e., life scientists.

State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness. This paper presents VirtualSense, an open-hardware open-source ultra-low-power reactive wireless sensor module featuring a Java-compatible VM. \u00a9 2012 Emanuele Lattanzi and Alessandro Bogliolo.","alternate_title1":"Int.

For this purpose, we have designed a basic low-cost pressure sensor that can be built from components easily available. Several of these basic sensors (of sizes and shapes chosen specifically for the task) are integrated into a posture sensor cushion, which is electronically controlled by an Arduino microcontroller board. This accounts for experiments involving either a single cushion to be used by an individual end-user setting approach or classroom approaches where several of these cushions make up a sensor network via ZigBee wireless connections. The system thus formed is an excellent alternative to other more expensive commercial systems and provides a low-cost, easy-to-use, portable, scalable, autonomous, flexible solution with free hardware and software, which can be integrated with other sensing devices into a larger affect detection system, customizable to cope with postural changes at required time intervals and support single and collective oriented experimentation approaches. \u00a9 2015 Ricardo Barba et al.","alternate_title1":"Int.

In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario. \u00a9 2016 L.

But drawbacks of IoT, such as having to use dedicated equipment and having to pay for a flat fee monthly, do not satisfy the consumers' demands. These shortcomings of IoT is causing the appearance of users who try to design the environment of IoT that responds their demands and naturally, attempts to have monitoring system through open-source hardware like Arduino. Open source hardware has attracted a great deal of attention for the diffusion of the Internet of things as a key element of the Internet construction. The emergence of open source hardware, which has the advantage of low cost and easy and fast development, has made it possible to embody the idea of object Internet application services.

The robot uses computer vision, a self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and error-prone.

It is based upon a single-degree-of- freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a \"motorized fader.\" A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented. \u00a9 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","alternate_title1":"Comput Music J","authors":["Berdahl, E.","Kontogeorgakopoulos, A."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1162\/COMJ_a_00166","end_page":"34","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"01489267 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Computer programming","DC motors","Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","Feedback","Open systems","Software engineering","Voltage dividers","Control signal","Device Driver","Embedded implementation","Force feedback","Open-source hardwares","Reconfigurable","Serial connection","Single degree of freedoms","Open source software"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"23","title":"The firefader: Simple, open-source, and reconfigurable haptic force feedback for musicians","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887359566&doi=10.1162%2fCOMJ_a_00166&partnerID=40&md5=2bab2e82322581bddffbdea6ae73257e","volume":"37","year":"2013","author_address":"[Berdahl, Edgar] Tech Univ Berlin, Sekretariat EN 8, Audio Commun Grp, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.

With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an open hardware platform and easily accessible components. As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures, records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1) collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware platform that allows for an effective way to compare different commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype sensors.

Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China\u2019s makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China\u2019s makers demonstrate that the future of making\u2014if to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industry\u2014rests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China\u2019s first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China\u2019s makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of \u201chacking with Chinese characteristics,\u201d they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines.

These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.","alternate_title1":"Media Cult.

For knowledge? As cultural production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer challenge the \u2018dominant paradigm\u2019 that knowledge and information should be protected and monetized, the logic of \u2018open sourcing\u2019 has extended into many cultural spheres. This article positions \u2018openness\u2019 as a value that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of \u2018openness\u2019 from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses. The insights in this article are valuable for anyone studying open source and peer production processes and the knowledge claims surrounding them. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.","alternate_title1":"Media Cult.

To produce good design thinkers, design activities must be implemented in engineering curriculums, and have to start at early years. In this prospect, many leading universities have launched many interesting initiatives. These initiatives are, however, arduous for implementation in the context of universities in the developing countries due to deep-rooted local constraints, like shortage of financial and skilled human resources. Therefore, some tailored design learning initiatives, taking into account these constraints, have to be developed. In this context, a cost-effective project has been designed and implemented, in our faculty, to early introduce mechanical engineering students, in their first years, to engineering design. The proposed project was designed with respect to a proposed framework of desired engineering design competencies in conjunction with concerns for overcoming constraints and barriers of implementation context. The project encompasses two successive activities for the first and second years. The first activity plunges the students in a design thinking approach to create robotic applications using only cost-effective robotic kits. The second activity is dedicated to the design, analysis, and building of mechanical systems using only commonly used materials and cheap open hardware devices. Through this project, the students significantly improved some targeted skills as creative problem solving, communication, and teamwork. Finally, the project is thought to be valuable for all universities with similar context of limited resources. \u00a9 SAGE Publications.","alternate_title1":"Int. J. Mech. Eng.

Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King\u2019s College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors \u20130.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","alternate_title1":"Prog. Phys.

A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts\u2019 behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital \u201cRaymundo Abarca Alarc\u00f3n,\u201d constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.","alternate_title1":"Surg.

For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap\/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs. \u00a9 2016, \u00a9 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.","alternate_title1":"J.

It has transformed manufacturing across virtually every industry, bringing about incredible advances in research and medicine. The rapidly growing consumer market now includes convenient and affordable desktop 3D printers. These are being used in the laboratory to create custom 3D-printed equipment, and a growing community of designers are contributing open-source, cost-effective innovations that can be used by both professionals and enthusiasts. User stories from investigators at the National Institutes of Health and the biomedical research community demonstrate the power of 3D printing to save valuable time and funding. While adoption of 3D printing has been slow in the biosciences to date, the potential is vast. The market predicts that within several years, 3D printers could be commonplace within the home; with so many practical uses for 3D printing, we anticipate that the technology will also play an increasingly important role in the laboratory. ?? ?????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????3D printing????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????3D????????????????????????????3D??????????????????????????????????????????3D????????????????????????????????3D?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?? ?? ????? ??? 3D ???? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ???????. ? ??? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????. ??? ???? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??? ???? 3D ???? ???????. ??? ??? 3D ?? ??? ??? ?? ????? ???? ???, ???? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ????. ?? ???(National Institutes of Health)? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ?? ???, 3D ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ? ??? ?????. ???? 3D ???? ?????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????. ??? ? ? ??? 3D ???? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?????. ??? ?? 3D ??? ?? ??? ??, ? ??? ?????? ?? ? ??? ??? ? ??? ?????. ?? 3D ??,???????,??????????????????????????????????????????????,?????????????????,???????3D ??????????????????????,????????? 3D ????,???????????????????????,???????????????,??????????????????(National Institutes of Health)??????????????????????,3D ?????????????????????,?? 3D ????????????????,?????????????????,?????,3D ??????????????? 3D ??????,????,??,????,?????????????????? ?? 3D ?????????,???????????????????????????????????????????,?????????????????,?????????3D ??????????????????????,????????? 3D ????,??????????????????????????,???????????????,??????????????????

Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures. \u00a9 2018 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.","alternate_title1":"SLAS Tech.","authors":["Shumate, J.","Baillargeon, P.","Spicer, T.P.","Scampavia, L."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1177\/2472630318769454","end_page":"447","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"24726303 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D printing","dispenser","HTS","IoT","microcontroller","3D printers","Dispensers","Gravimetric analysis","Microcontrollers","Open source software","Open systems","Precision balances","Quality control","Throughput","3-D printing","High throughput screening","Internet of Things (IOT)","Laboratory environment","Open-source hardwares","Operator interventions","Real time measurements","Visual verification","Internet of things","computer aided design","gravimetry","high throughput screening","information","laboratory","liquid dispensing","measurement precision","physical parameters","quality control","Review","simulation","software","three dimensional printing","weight","cloud computing","devices","high throughput screening","laboratory automation","quality control","standards","solvent","Automation, Laboratory","Cloud Computing","High-Throughput Screening Assays","Quality Control","Software","Solvents"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"5","start_page":"440","title":"IoT for Real-Time Measurement of High-Throughput Liquid Dispensing in Laboratory Environments","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045285455&doi=10.1177%2f2472630318769454&partnerID=40&md5=086dbe37a10d23c0a92e528cdbeb8ef9","volume":"23","year":"2018","author_address":"[Shumate, Justin; Baillargeon, Pierre; Spicer, Timothy P.; Scampavia, Louis] Scripps Florida, Scripps Res Inst, Mol Screening Ctr, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.

Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and\/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests.

Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive\/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic\/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive\/restrictive patients. Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory\/expiratory pressures up to 20\/10 cm H2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45 +\/- 1.68 without support to 2.83 +\/- 1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80 +\/- 1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.","alternate_title1":"Eur.

Several methods have been described in the literature for measuring the amount of animal movement but most are flawed or expensive. Here, we describe an open source, modular, low-cost, user-friendiy, highly sensitive, non-invasive system that records all the movements of a rat in its cage. Methods: Our activity monitoring system quantifies overall free movements of rodents without any markers, using a commercially available CCTV and a newly designed motion detection software developed on a GNU\/Linux-operating computer. The operating principle is that the amount of overall movement of an object can be expressed by the difference in total area occupied by the object in two consecutive picture frames. The application is based on software modules that allow the system to be used in a high-throughput workflow. Documentation, example files, source code and binary files can be freely downloaded from the project website at http:\/\/bioinformatics.org\/gemvid\/. Results: In a series of experiments with objects of pre-defined oscillation frequencies and movements, we documented the sensitivity, reproducibility and stability of our system. We also compared data obtained with our system and data obtained with an Actiwatch device. Finally, to validate the system, results obtained from the automated observation of 6 rats during 7 days in a regular light cycle are presented and are accompanied by a stability test. The validity of this system is further demonstrated through the observation of 2 rats in constant dark conditions that displayed the expected free running of their circadian rhythm. Conclusion: The present study describes a system that relies on video frame differences to automatically quantify overall free movements of a rodent without any markers. It allows the monitoring of rats in their own environment for an extended period of time. By using a low-cost, open source hardware\/software solution, laboratories can greatly simplify their data acquisition and analysis pipelines and improve their workload. \u00a9 2006 Poirrier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","alternate_title1":"J.

X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab\/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1). The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds greater than 2m.s(-1) and reject attitude disturbances of 20' within 0.8s.","alternate_title1":"Int. J.

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings. \u00a9 2020 Pearce JM.","alternate_title1":"F1000 Res.","authors":["Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.12688\/f1000research.22942.2","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"20461402 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["COVID-19","Influenza pandemic","Medical hardware","Open hardware","Open source","Pandemic","Ventilation","Ventilator","Article","artificial ventilation","computer aided design","coronavirus disease 2019","equipment design","human","Internet","noninvasive ventilation","oxygen therapy","pandemic","positive end expiratory pressure","pressure controlled ventilation","pressure support ventilation","public access ventilator","systematic review","Betacoronavirus","Coronavirus infection","virus pneumonia","Betacoronavirus","Coronavirus Infections","Humans","Pandemics","Pneumonia, Viral"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"A review of open source ventilators for COVID-19 and future pandemics","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084868717&doi=10.12688%2ff1000research.22942.2&partnerID=40&md5=8c7bf02c31f0aaffdfab62f45c1df17a","volume":"9","year":"2020","author_address":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI  49931, United States","custom2":"32411358","custom3":null,"custom7":"218","notes":["Cited By :27","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Pearce, J.M.; Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, United States; email: pearce@mtu.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"F1000 Research Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"F1000Research","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":400,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"The Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP) is a public\/private partnership established through the World Bank to improve food safety systems through a globally coordinated and locally-driven approach. This concept paper aims to establish a framework to help GFSP fully leverage the potential of open models. In preparing this paper the authors spoke to many different GFSP stakeholders who asked questions about open models such as: what is it? what's in it for me? why use an open rather than a proprietary model? how will open models generate equivalent or greater sustainable revenue streams compared to the current \"traditional? approaches? This last question came up many times with assertions that traditional service providers need to see opportunity for equivalent or greater revenue dollars before they will buy-in. This paper identifies open value propositions for GFSP stakeholders and proposes a framework for creating and structuring that value. Open Educational Resources (OER) were the primary open practice GFSP partners spoke to us about, as they provide a logical entry point for collaboration. Going forward, funders should consider requiring that educational resources and concomitant data resulting from their sponsorship should be open, as a public good. There are, however, many other forms of open practice that bring value to the GFSP. Nine different open strategies and tactics (Appendix A) are described, including: open content (including OER and open courseware), open data, open access (research), open government, open source software, open standards, open policy, open licensing and open hardware. It is recommended that all stakeholders proactively pursue \"openness\" as an operating principle. This paper presents an overall GFSP Open Ecosystem Engagement Strategy within which specific local case examples can be situated. Two different case examples, China and Colombia, are presented to show both project-based and crowd-sourced, direct-to-public paths through this ecosystem. \u00a9 2015 Stacey P et al.","alternate_title1":"F1000 Res.","authors":["Stacey, P.","Fons, G.","Bernardo, T.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.12688\/f1000research.6123.1","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"20461402 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Article","China","climate change","Colombia","conceptual framework","cost effectiveness analysis","curriculum","employment","environmental sustainability","food quality","food safety","food security","human","international cooperation","knowledge","open access","open content","open data","open ecosystem engagement strategy","open government","open hardware","open licensing","open policy","open source software","open standard","open study","policy","public-private partnership"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"An open ecosystem engagement strategy through the lens of global food safety","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937546089&doi=10.12688%2ff1000research.6123.1&partnerID=40&md5=c19073afcb2e6a5b6319abff016de82a","volume":"4","year":"2015","author_address":"Creative Commons, Mountain ViewCA  94042, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"129","notes":["Cited By :1","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Bernardo, T.M.; College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State UniversityUnited States"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Faculty of 1000 Ltd","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"F1000Research","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":401,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing. \u00a9 2019, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

The framework has been implemented in real hardware and software. Experiments with the implemented system shows that our framework can help increase the lifetime of the solar powered IoT system. The framework prevented the IoT device from power down due to the full discharge of the battery at night time, by changing the execution rate based on energy accumulation and battery status. The proposed framework has been implemented using open hardware compatible with Arduino, so it can be used for a wide range of IoT applications and services. \u00a9 2018, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design\/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This \"scale-stealing\" mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Gambardella, A","Von Hippel, E"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1287\/stsc.2018.0075","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2333-2050","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Open Sourcing as a Profit-Maximizing Strategy for Downstream Firms","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"4","year":"2019","author_address":"[Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Invernizzi Ctr Res Innovat Org Strategy & Entrepr, I-20136 Milan, Italy.

An important aspect of the design is that the illumination unit consists of reflective elements, thereby reducing chromatic aberrations an order of magnitude as compared to refractive counterparts.

Existing systems require precise mechanical control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists. Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI. The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of similar to 0.7 mu m. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm(2) region in similar to 2 mins with throughput comparable to existing high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly available and utilizable without loss of capacity.

Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.

One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food- and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license. \u00a9 2011 Rowe et al.","alternate_title1":"PLoS ONE","authors":["Rowe, A.A.","Bonham, A.J.","White, R.J.","Zimmer, M.P.","Yadgar, R.J.","Hobza, T.M.","Honea, J.W.","Ben-Yaacov, I.","Plaxco, K.W."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0023783","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"19326203 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["arsenic","paracetamol","DNA","analytic method","article","biosensor","computer program","cost effectiveness analysis","cyclic potentiometry","device","DNA determination","drug quality","education","electrochemistry","environmental monitoring","food quality","mathematical analysis","medical research","microcomputer","potentiometry","potentiostat","chemical analysis","developing country","economics","education","electrical equipment","genetic procedures","genetics","instrumentation","laboratory","polymerase chain reaction","university","Biosensing Techniques","Chemistry Techniques, Analytical","Developing Countries","DNA","Education","Electrical Equipment and Supplies","Electrochemistry","Laboratories","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Universities"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"9","start_page":null,"title":"Cheapstat: An open-source, \"do-it-yourself\" potentiostat for analytical and educational applications","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052705319&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0023783&partnerID=40&md5=f29fd14566755f957a3079dd606438ec","volume":"6","year":"2011","author_address":"[Rowe, Aaron A.; Bonham, Andrew J.; White, Ryan J.; Plaxco, Kevin W.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.

To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3-D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods. \u00a9 2013 Zhang et al.","alternate_title1":"PLoS ONE","authors":["Zhang, C.","Anzalone, N.C.","Faria, R.P.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0059840","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"19326203 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["article","computer aided design","computer program","cost minimization analysis","equipment design","optics","process development","process optimization","three dimensional imaging","Computer-Aided Design","Costs and Cost Analysis","Magnetics","Optics and Photonics","Printing","Thermodynamics"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":null,"title":"Open-Source 3D-Printable Optics Equipment","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875448705&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0059840&partnerID=40&md5=2f7878f62e025d13defc7d1dd6287ad8","volume":"8","year":"2013","author_address":"[Zhang, Chenlong; Anzalone, Nicholas C.; Faria, Rodrigo P.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Michigan Tech Open Sustainabil Technol Lab, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (\u03bcBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The \u03bcBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the \u03bcBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The \u03bcBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the \u03bcBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The \u03bcBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the \u03bcBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics. \u00a9 2013 Myers et al.","alternate_title1":"PLoS ONE","authors":["Myers, F.B.","Henrikson, R.H.","Bone, J.","Lee, L.P."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0070266","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"19326203 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["integrase","article","battery life","controlled study","diagnostic equipment","DNA determination","DNA purification","equipment design","fluorescence analysis","gene identification","genotype","global positioning system","heater uniformity","Human immunodeficiency virus 1","integrase gene","limit of detection","loop mediated isothermal amplification","microfluidic analysis","microfluidic biomolecular amplification reader","nonhuman","nucleic acid amplification","physical parameters","process development","sensitivity analysis","virus gene","Diagnosis","Electric Power Supplies","Genomics","HIV","Hot Temperature","Humans","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques","Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques","Point-of-Care Systems","Spectrometry, Fluorescence","Time Factors"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"8","start_page":null,"title":"A Handheld Point-of-Care Genomic Diagnostic System","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880969980&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0070266&partnerID=40&md5=958ea4c501a027765424bc7e50137557","volume":"8","year":"2013","author_address":"[Myers, Frank B.; Henrikson, Richard H.; Lee, Luke P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15% of the cost for materials.

Applying this philosophy to microfluidic devices can play a fundamental role in disseminating these technologies outside specialist labs and into industrial use. Here we show how nanoliter droplets can be manipulated using a commercial DVD writer, interfaced with an Arduino electronic controller. We couple the optical setup with a droplet generation and manipulation device based on the \"confinement gradients\" approach. This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup. \u00a9 2016 Frot et al.

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)\u2013a common model species in ecotoxicology\u2014to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water. \u00a9 2017 Steffens et al.

In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan\/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering.

In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term \u2018superlamellae consolidation\u2019 to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of >99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions. \u00a9 2018 Nandy et al.

This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC (R)) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components. To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Lopin, P","Lopin, KV"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0201353","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"1932-6203","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"PSoC-Stat: A single chip open source potentiostat based on a Programmable System on a Chip","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"13","year":"2018","author_address":"[Lopin, Prattana] Naresuan Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Phitsanulok, Thailand.

We describe a low cost (below $700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed \u2018lab-on-a-comb\u2019 to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of ~420 \u00d7 300mm, which allows 29 \u2018lab-on-a-comb\u2019 devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1\u03bcl samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes. \u00a9 2019 Needs et al.

In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment. \u00a9 2019 Machado et al.

Collaborations and interactions are the backbone of the contemporary Do-It-Yourself (DIY) or 'maker culture', a distributed milieu of open software programmers and hardware hackers, but also crafters, backyard tinkerers, hobbyists and homesteaders. The scene is held together by micro-management tactics, or 'molecular' management, using protocols to guide collaborative innovation and shared craft practices, forming an emergent and innovative creative cottage industry. The maker culture is thus less of a DIY and more a do-it-together culture, merging collaborative play and interactions, often for the sake of shared curiosity. The mindset of the participants is that of the explorative craftsman; using a practical attitude of sharing ideas, methods and skills among practitioners, and the interactions are managed in a flat and meshworked manner through the use of protocols. The text specifically examines the protocols of the maker movement, finding an immediate connection between hardware protocols, like the 'makers bill of rights' guiding the principles of open source hardware, and the principles reflected in the social protocols of two hacker spaces. The maker culture is not only a loose network of dispersed tinkerers, it is also a close-knit molecular assemblage of materials, tools, skills and makers. \u00a9 2012 Intellect Ltd Editorial.

Art traditionally functions as an environment for philosophical and creative activity that works to secure its borders from intruding dictatorial ethics, ideology, politics or dogma that might sully its aim to maintain its open arduous exploration of the clash between image and meaning, icon and significance, or perception and identity in reference to culture and history. Integrating technology into this discourse introduces a milieu of associations, expectations and conclusions about how technological innovation, practices and products should be steered, which can also influence what we both make and teach. The web has since evolved into a pervasively instantaneous space for more involved forms of communication (Google hangout), content sharing (SVN), publishing (blogs), community building (messageboards, Facebook), creative performance (Isadora) and more. Now creative interactive initiatives are not limited to merely making a statement or triggering a semiotic synapse, but rather can have a social impact, enacting, mobilizing and serving as a resource for the public. Telematic Art that includes the activities surrounding Digital Communities and their behaviour, does not merely provide an environment to discuss social issues, but embodies social interaction in ways in which new forms of collective expression can be realized. The development of telematics tools is empowering for the public while serving as a medium that influences how individuals interact. Between DIY\/DIWO models, open source hardware, software, and creation initiatives, practivist initiatives, creative hacking ideologies, immersion, and web-based communication tools to localize the international collaborative workshop, I believe our formats for education and exchange are becoming more collective and empowering, and with the inclusion of digital social collaboration initiatives seen in myriad examples of Telematic Art, there exists the potential to motivate a mindset desiring new shifts in perception and making with the goals of serving the global community in significant and direct ways.","alternate_title1":"Technoetic Arts","authors":["Kazemzadeh, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1386\/tear.11.3.253_1","end_page":"261","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"1477965X (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Collaboration","Consciousness","Cybernetics","Food deserts","Lilipad","Refarmthecity","Urban farming","Waterworks"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"253","title":"Postnational technollaboration within the postbiotanical village (an apophenoetic prophecy)","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897490960&doi=10.1386%2ftear.11.3.253_1&partnerID=40&md5=a2829cee9f90faea1e663ee1a65fb0d7","volume":"11","year":"2013","author_address":"Gallaudet University, United States","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Kazemzadeh, M.; Gallaudet UniversityUnited States"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Intellect Ltd.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Technoetic Arts","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Conference Paper","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":425,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Arduino is a popular open source hardware toolkit for science and engineering education due to its easy use and various good examples. But, students or beginners who have no experience and knowledge of electronic engineering or programming languages still feel a considerable barrier to use Arduino. This study analyzes the barrier of beginners in using the open source hardware. In order to resolve the difficulty in firmware programming, we adopt a functional concise script composed of simplified service commands and minimum options to use the open hardware and proposes a new script-based open source hardware programming environment. From the comparison result with previous development toolkit, we confirm that the programming by the proposed script-based simple programming toolkit is substantially simple by adopting simple script and automatic generations of irrelevant instructions, type declarations and semicolons in programming the open source hardware of Arduino. \u00a9 2016 SERSC.","alternate_title1":"Int.

In contrast, ultrasonic waves are used instead of electromagnetic waves in ultrasonic radar. The low power consumption, low cost and ease of implementation are considered the main features of the ultrasonic radar to be devoted in several applications such as security purposes, object detection and avoidance systems in robotics. This work presents a design and implementation of ultrasonic radar for distance measurements. The design consists of an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino board as a controller, a servo motor and a java application. The detection range of the proposed system is tested up to 500 cm with the angle of rotation from (0 to +180) and (180 to 0) degrees for different types of obstacles or objects (sponge, wood an aluminum). The design is built using open source hardware (Arduino Uno 328) which is coded via Micro C environment as a software entity. The effectiveness of the proposed design is measured using a statistical analysis of the distance error between the radar and the obstacles. The results obtained for all types of obstacles are tabled and graphed to prove that a very small error can be achieved using the proposed design. \u00a9 2018 Haraa Raheem Hatem et. al.","alternate_title1":"Int.

The possible solutions to problems are often evaluated with laboratory prototypes in order to determine their real performance. We propose in this paper an architecture for the design and development of robotic systems (particularly autonomous multi-robot Systems) that facilitate the work in laboratory due to an open robust and reliable architecture. Method: The architecture is supported in open source hardware and software. The operation and communication strategy is characterized by a low consumption of resources, both in processing and communication, and real-time operation. As developement platform and Operating System, we used Linux: the communication scheme and the embedded systems run on a 32-bit processor, with a 16-bit instruction set (not ARM, but with Harvard architecture), at 80 MHz (Tensilica Xtensa LX106) for the implementation of the agents. The tools used allow the solution to be bothe efficient and inexpensive. Results: The architecture has been successfully applied in the implementation of a strategy of navigation for a set of small autonomous robots. A set of robots were provided with wireless communication capability, minimum capacity of environmental sensing (obstacle detection) and a navigation algorithm based on population sizes (mimicking the bacterial Quorum Sensing). The system is implemented with great ease, demonstrating both the viability of the navigation strategy and the versatility, robustness and scalability of the OpenRRArch architecture. Conclusions: The proposed architecture constitutes a solution for the construction of distributed control systems, in particular multi-agent robotic systems. It enables the rapid, low-cost and high-performance implementation of systems with real-time cooperation and communication capabilities. The architecture allows the integration of agents with different processing capabilities, which allows adaptation to the needs of the task. The functions of each agent can be reduced or increased from their code, and\/or by selecting other embedded hardware.","alternate_title1":"Tecnura","authors":["Mart\u00ednez Sarmiento, Fredy Hern\u00e1n","Giral Ram\u00edrez, Diego Armando"],"database_provider":"http:\/\/www.scielo.org\/","date":"2017-01-30","doi":"10.14483\/udistrital.jour.tecnura.2017.1.a07","end_page":"104","file_attachments1":"http:\/\/www.scielo.org.co\/pdf\/tecn\/v21n51\/v21n51a07.pdf","id":"S0123-921X2017000100007-col","issn":"0123-921X","journal_name":"Tecnura","keywords":["control","Linux","Open-source","robots","sistemas embebidos","Control","Embedded Systems","Linux","Open-source","Robots"],"language":"es","name_of_database":"SciELO Colombia","number":"51","start_page":"96","title":"OpenRRArch: una arquitectura abierta, robusta y confiable para el control de robots aut\u00f3nomos","translated_title":"OpenRRArch: An open, robust and reliable architecture for controlling autonomous robots","type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.org.co\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0123-921X2017000100007&lang=en","volume":"21","year":"2017","author_address":null,"custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":null,"place_published":null,"publisher":null,"secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":null,"short_title":null,"type_of_work":null,"accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":429,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Despite the fact that the open-source community around the RISC-V instruction set archi- tecture is growing rapidly, there is still no high-speed open-source hardware implementation of the IEEE 754-2008 oating-point standard available.

The design has been verified with the industry standard simulation-based Universal Verification Methodology using the Specman e Hardware Verification Language. The most challenging part of the verification is the reference model, for which we in- tegrated the Floating-Point Unit of an existing Intel processor using the Function Level Interface provided by Specman e. With the use of Intel's Floating-Point Unit we have a \"known good\" and fast reference model. The Back-End ow was done with Global Foundries' 22 nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (GF22FDX) process using Cadence tools. We reached 1.8 GHz over PVT corners with a 0.8 V forward body bias, but there is still a large potential for further RTL opti- mization.

Firstly, based on the open source hardware of Fritz humanoid head robot, an integrated emotional expression mapping model was proposed by extending the functional module of voice, vision and so on. Secondly, to achieve a natural interaction between the expression robot and the operator, the integrated visual analysis is mainly utilised for emotion calculation. Haar-like featured cascade classified algorithm is utilised for automatic face location. Gabor feature is filtered and down-sampled as the emotional expression feature. To deal with unreasonable samples distribution in traditional eigenface, an optimised eigenvectors\u2019s selection is built by comparing projection reconstructed images with original image. Finally, the classification of with-in class PCA with energy dimension is served as expression recognition.

Though many similar platforms or schemes particular for smart home applications have been proposed, many issues such as multiple connectivity due to diversity of smart home applications and supporting for real-time operations have not been solved properly. We propose a smart home foundation scheme adopting open source hardware devices and cloud computing technology to explore these issues. In this scheme, Arduino Yun-based smart hardware devices can connect to the cloud server through multiply network connectivity. By utilising Spacebrew technology, a bidirectional real-time communication can be implemented which provides a solid foundation for real-time operations of smart home. The core functions of the scheme are exposed through RESTful web services in a SaaS (short for software as a service) manner and can be called by various clients and other applications. Demonstrative applications show that the proposed smart home foundation scheme provides adequate support for creating smart home applications based on wireless open source hardware devices.

This architecture is a hardware and software co-design where embedded processors drive the FPGA for motor control. It is robot type independent, as long as the motors are equipped with incremental position encoders and driven by PWM signals. Low cost, low power consumption, high stability, flexibility and expandability are the key advantages. The architecture and related IP cores are developed through a component-based design model which interprets a mechatronic system by computation, communication, configuration and coordination components, together with composition of these components and blackboxes. The motor controller IP core is provided in the consistency of open hardware. Open software implies the use of OROCOS (Bruyninckx, 2001). The performance of visual servoing behaviour is evaluated by visual coupling of a Performer MK2 robot and a KUKA lightweight robot.

Students often struggle to learn program due to lack of extensive hands-on practice and sufficient time to become familiar with programming concept. In this paper we report on an action research study of students' exploration and use of previously unexplored low-cost open-source mobile devices for learning programming. The study was conducted over a period of 14 weeks in University of West London, UK, with the postgraduate students studying Mobile Application Development (MAD) module which is a part of the MSc Network and Mobile Computing course. We introduced the Wikireader, a handheld reading device, and Nanonote, a lightweight pocket computer. In this study, we used mixed methods research methodology and data analysis was guided by the Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education (FRAME) model. The results of our evaluations indicate open-source devices have potential to enhance motivation to learn programming without being restricted to the limited practical sessions in the university lab and also facilitate offline reading.

By analogy, we use the 'urban metabolism' concept showing the life of a city. A city is a set of very complex processes involving both public and private stakeholders, areas and infrastructures. Urban metabolism can be analysed and therefore its status evaluated based on measuring specific parameters in order to offer sustainable services for people. The internet of things (IoT) paradigm helps the collection of large amounts of data that become available for decision makers and city managers to improve the urban metabolism.

His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU\/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called \"self-learning\", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by \"artificial intelligence\"can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation. \u00a9 2020 Andreas Beinsteiner, published by De Gruyter 2020.","alternate_title1":"Open Cult.

Analyzing the air distribution inside these facilities and the correct operation of the fans can be a challenging. This could be determined using cost prohibitive techniques as particle image velocimetry or deploying large wind sensors networks on-site. To avoid this limitation without a lack of measurement accuracy, this research was focused on developing and test a low-cost anemometer network based in low cost propeller\u2019s anemometers, built using fused 3D-printed and open-hardware platforms. Four propeller anemometers with three to six blades were simulated using the 6-DOF method of ANSYS computer fluid dynamics software. Similar results were obtained for all the simulated models with minor differences. Anemometers were tested in an open circuit wind tunnel before to be evaluated in two open compost dairy barn building using high-volume low-speed and low-volume high-speed fans. Data were analyzed by employing contour maps, descriptive statistics and correlation. The results show that the anemometer network determines the fan\u2019s wind profile for wind speeds over 0.7 m s-1 and it was possible to determine the facilities spots with ventilation problems. The proposed anemometer network and methodology are a good alternative to analyze the operating conditions of the tested agricultural facilities and optimize its performance. \u00a9 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

In a view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes - supervised and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible, which results in at least 50% test time reduction.

Studying multiple subjects for extended periods can be made more efficient through simultaneous recordings, but scaling up recordings to accommodate larger numbers of subjects simultaneously requires coordination and consideration of costs and flexibility. To facilitate this process, we have developed OpBox, an open source set of tools to acquire electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) flexibly from multiple rodent subjects simultaneously. OpBox combines open source hardware and software with off-the-shelf components to create a system that costs less than commercial solutions ($500 per subject), and can be easily deployed for multiple subjects. Coded in MATLAB, OpBox scripts can simultaneously and flexibly collect and display multiple analog and digital data streams, for instance real-time EEG and EMG, event triggers from a behavioral system, and rotary encoder data. OpBox also calculates and displays real-time spectral representations and event-related potentials (ERPs). To verify the performance of our system, we compare our amplifiers with two other commercial amplifiers, a Grass P55 AC preamplifier and an Intan RHD2000-series amplifier. The OpBox amplifier performs comparably to commercial amplifiers for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), noise floors, and common mode rejection. We also demonstrate that our acquisition system can reliably record multichannel data from multiple subjects, and has been successfully tested with 12 subjects running simultaneously on a single standard desktop computer. Together, OpBox increases the flexibility and lowers the cost for simultaneous acquisition of electrophysiology data from multiple subjects.

Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-cage measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications. \u00a9 2019 Godynyuk et al.","alternate_title1":"eNeuro","authors":["Godynyuk, E.","Bluitt, M.N.","Tooley, J.R.","Kravitz, A.V.","Creed, M.C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1523\/ENEURO.0292-19.2019","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"23732822 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino","Open source hardware","Two-bottle choice","water","water","adult","Article","behavior assessment","chocolate milk","cost benefit analysis","female","food intake","home-cage activity test","liquid","male","metabolism","mouse","nerve cell","neuroscience","nonhuman","photometry","priority journal","rodent","time lapse imaging","animal","animal housing","C57BL mouse","devices","drinking behavior","equipment design","milk","physiology","procedures","rodent","Animals","Drinking Behavior","Equipment Design","Female","Housing, Animal","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Milk","Rodentia","Water"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"5","start_page":null,"title":"An open-source, automated home-cage sipper device for monitoring liquid ingestive behavior in rodents","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073125045&doi=10.1523%2fENEURO.0292-19.2019&partnerID=40&md5=58c7e3fc559d53995aa31a06075b9ab1","volume":"6","year":"2019","author_address":"[Godynyuk, Elizabeth; Tooley, Jessica R.; Kravitz, Alexxai, V; Creed, Meaghan C.] Washington Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.

This modular approach results in several frameworks that facilitate the functional expansion of the whole solution, the simplification of fault diagnosis and repair processes, and the reduction of development time, to mention a few. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.","alternate_title1":"Dyna rev.fac.nac.minas","authors":["Aristiz\u00e1bal, Luis M.","R\u00faa, Santiago","Gaviria, Carlos E.","Osorio, Sandra P.","Zuluaga, Carlos A.","Posada, Norha L.","V\u00e1squez, Rafael E."],"database_provider":"http:\/\/www.scielo.org\/","date":"2016-02","doi":"10.15446\/dyna.v83n195.49828","end_page":"205","file_attachments1":null,"id":"S0012-73532016000100025-col","issn":"00127353 (ISSN)","journal_name":"DYNA","keywords":["hardware de fuente abierta","plataformas de control de ROVs","exploraci\u00f3n subacu\u00e1tica","open-source hardware","ROV control platforms","underwater exploration"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"SciELO Colombia","number":"195","start_page":"198","title":"Design of an open source-based control platform for an underwater remotely operated vehicle","translated_title":"Dise\u00f1o de una plataforma de control basada en fuente abierta para un veh\u00edculo subacu\u00e1tico operado remotamente","type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958750307&doi=10.15446%2fdyna.v83n195.49828&partnerID=40&md5=0e2887deef62fa751d054c0a8b0fede1","volume":"83","year":"2016","author_address":"Escuela de Ingenier\u00edas, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medell\u00edn, Colombia","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :12","Export Date: 18 February 2021"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"DYNA (Colombia)","short_title":"Dise\u00f1o de una plataforma de control basada en fuente abierta para un veh\u00edculo subacu\u00e1tico operado remotamente","type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":443,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential\u2013drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manufacturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable. This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them. Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (Turtle-Bot 2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future. \u00a9 2018 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.","alternate_title1":"Adv.

A computer architecture course involves mainly the microprocessor structure and operation which constitutes the heart of the whole system. Due to microprocessor complexity, a number of simulation software solutions have been developed for supporting the corresponding courses. On the other hand, simulators offer only a visual environment where the students cannot change operational or structural characteristics for studying the corresponding microprocessor behavior. Moreover, and much more important is the fact that students cannot demystify the physical level where bit manipulation takes place. A novel and low cost approach for studying in depth microprocessor structure and operation at programming and hardware level is presented and finally proposed for the very first time in this paper. The student uses programmable hardware modules for developing the internal structure of a microprocessor. Finally, the developed microprocessor can be studied from programmer\u2019s or developer\u2019s view. \u00a9 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","alternate_title1":"Int. Rev.

Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware. \u00a9 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","alternate_title1":"IEICE Trans Inf Syst","authors":["Kobayashi, R.","Kise, K."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.1587\/transinf.2016EDP7383","end_page":"1015","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"09168532 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Data compression","Hardware accelerator","Open source","Sorting","Acceleration","Computer hardware","Data compression","Embedded systems","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Hardware","Image processing","Internet of things","Open source software","Open systems","Technology transfer","Computational performance","Hardware accelerators","High performance systems","Internet of Things (IOT)","Open sources","Open-source hardwares","Performance constraints","Tuning design parameters","Sorting"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"5","start_page":"1003","title":"A high performance FPGA-based sorting accelerator with a data compression mechanism","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018942266&doi=10.1587%2ftransinf.2016EDP7383&partnerID=40&md5=26097ffda059444d4fb9a32735fa7d07","volume":"E100D","year":"2017","author_address":"[Kobayashi, Ryohei] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3053577, Japan.

However, utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware codesign leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily.

This variability is greater in the no-tillage system because there is no homogenization of the soil surface layer. This study evaluated the effect of fertilization strategies on soil chemical properties at distinct soil depths after three and six years from the beginning of the experiment in a Haplohumox under long-term no-tillage. Besides, the variation of these properties considering two methods of soil sampling, with and without inclusion of the seeding row, was evaluated. Ten treatments were applied, nine considering P sources (rock phosphate and triple superphosphate), row preparation equipment (double disc opener and coulter opener), fertilizer placement (in-row and broadcast), time of application (summer and winter) and one control treatment, without fertilizer. The measured soil chemical properties were higher in the surface layers and depth distribution, except for P, was not influenced by the fertilization strategies. The soil P values were the lowest in the 0-5 cm layer where the coulter opener equipment had been continuously used for more than three years and no fertilizer was applied. With the inclusion of the sowing row in the soil sampling, higher K, Ca and CEC values were observed. The methodologies of soil sampling, with and without the inclusion of the sowing row and the 0-10 and 0-20 cm sampling layers resulted in similar fertilizer and lime recommendations for areas under long-term no-tillage.","alternate_title1":"Rev.

This paper describes and shows the results of a novel method of visualizing environmental emissions of corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure using photographic paper. H2S is a neurotoxic and flammable gas that smells like rotten eggs and is frequently associated with oil and natural gas extraction. Communities living with oil and gas development in Wyoming report odors of rotten eggs and describe symptoms of H2S exposure. H2S is recognized as an acute and chronic threat to human and environmental health and oil and gas companies are required to have plans in place to prevent and respond to accidental, high concentration releases of H2S. They are not, however, required to monitor, report or prevent routine daily emissions. Yet 15-25% of the oil and gas wells in the US are predicted to contain H2S, and some communities surrounded by multiple wells report chronic, routine exposure. Chronic exposure is difficult to represent with current tools for monitoring H2S because they are designed to measure acute workplace exposure. Informed by STS theories of black boxes and regimes of imperceptibility that focus on the need to revise not only regulations but also material tools of science, this paper describes the development of an indexical approach to visualizing this hazard. In indexical design, the reactive sensing element of a scientific instrument is brought to the foreground. The silver in the photopaper is an index as it tarnishes with H2S exposure. Discolored tests strips can be arranged together to form data-rich maps of the exposure landscape where this discoloration both represents how the gas spreads through a space and is a physical trace of the gas. Preliminary results in the form of data-rich maps show that regulating H2S emissions as primarily accidental is inappropriate and fails to adequately protect human health.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Wylie, S","Wilder, E","Vera, L","Thomas, D","McLaughlin, M"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.17351\/ests2017.123","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2413-8053","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Materializing Exposure: Developing an Indexical Method to Visualize Health Hazards Related to Fossil Fuel Extraction","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"3","year":"2017","author_address":"[Wylie, Sara] Northeastern Univ, Sociol Anthropol & Hlth Sci, Social Sci Environm Hlth Res Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a \"how-To\" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.","alternate_title1":"Seismol.

Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to \"... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies.\"In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, includingmultitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores. \u00a9 Seismological Society of America.","alternate_title1":"Seismol.

First, the integrated system design was adopted based on the Linux architecture, and the power-efficient opensource hardware was taken as the mini Linux PCs on the bridge site. Next, several sensor subsystems were integrated physically via the Ethernet, while nine core software modules were developed based on opensource software and integrated into a logical whole. The stability of the system was improved through dual PC redundancy and intelligent fault diagnosis. The data collected by sensors were analyzed in real time and only the valid data and alarms were transmitted to the remote monitoring center. In addition, the remote transmission and active control were completed, with the aid of 3G\/4G router, VPN and reverse SSH tunneling. In this way, the author developed an easy-to-maintain and cost-efficient SHM system. Finally, the effectiveness of the system was verified through the application in a bridge on an expressway in Yunnan Province, China. The results fully demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and cost effectiveness of the proposed system. This research fills up the gap in Linux-based SHM system design for bridges in remote regions, providing a reliable and advanced reference for the construction of bridge SHM systems. \u00a9 2019 Lavoisier.

Researchers have been working in developing such monitoring systems for the past decades. However, the needs of elderly people and their families are yet to be fulfilled, especially since the developed existing systems need their users to change their lifestyles. This work aims at suggesting a system for monitoring the occupancy of an elderly person on the bed. Capacitive proximity sensing system has been proven to be a probable solution for indoor localization, which senses the presence of a human body. Nevertheless, the requirements for installation are many, which make the integration costly. In this paper, a flexible and integrated solution is proposed that makes use of inexpensive, open source hardware, allowing indoor localization and fall detection. The bed monitoring system is made up of aluminum sheets sensor electrodes installed under the bed sheets to detect the sleeping patterns of the subject. An alarm system has been integrated into the room to enable the elderly to call for help during an emergency. Presence detector and light controlling device are installed on the floor surface to detect the mobility of the elderly and turn ON\/OFF the room lights automatically. The proposed system allows elderly people to live independent living at homes with all amenities.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Arshad, A","Ismail, AF","Khan, S","Hashim, W","Hasan, MK"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.18311\/ajprhc\/2017\/14970","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2250-1444","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Bedroom Monitoring System for Isolated Elderly People and Patients","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"9","year":"2017","author_address":"[Arshad, Atika; Ismail, Ahmad Fadzil; Khan, Sheroz; Hasan, Mohammad Kamrul] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Malaysia.

Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are \"Things\" with improved functionality, becoming \"Smart Things\" within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Gonzalez-Amarillo, CA","Cardenas-Garcia, CL","Caicedo-Munoz, JA","Mendoza-Moreno, MA"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.19053\/01211129.v29.n54.2020.11060","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"0121-1129","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Smart Lumini: A Smart Lighting System for Academic Environments Using IOT-Based Open-Source Hardware","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"29","year":"2020","author_address":"[Gonzalez-Amarillo, Carlos-Andres] Univ Cauca, Popayan Cuaca, Colombia.

Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V). The overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds. \u00a9 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu\u00edmica.","alternate_title1":"J.

A case study is presented where the platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical oxygen demand\/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than current commercially available tools. It is concluded that OS hardware development is a promising solution for the equipment necessary to perform water quality measurements in both developed and developing regions. \u00a9 IWA Publishing 2014.

Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for specific monitoring applications and working environments. \u00a9 IWA Publishing 2019.","alternate_title1":"J.

Advances such as open source hardware, personal medical devices, and mobile phone apps are creating opportunities for custom-made medical devices and personalized care. However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for regulation (ensuring safety and performance) with the need to innovate flexibly and efficiently. Compared with the emergence of new technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to the latest developments. For example, current regulations may not be suitable for approaches involving open source hardware, an increasingly popular way to create medical devices in the maker community. Medical device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of different ways, outside of clinical settings. Similarly, while regulatory guidance has been updated to address the proliferation of health-related mobile phone apps, it can be hard to know if and when these regulations apply. In this viewpoint, we present three examples of novel medical technologies to illustrate the types of regulatory issues that arise in the current environment. We also suggest opportunities for support, such as advances in the way we review and monitor medical technologies. \u00a9 2015 JMIR Publications.

However, developing an FPGA-based system is challenging because the complexity of the hardware and software co-design. In this paper, we propose a platform named hCODE to simplify the design, share, and deployment of FPGA accelerators. First, we adopt a shell-and-IP design pattern to improve the reusability and the portability of accelerator designs. Second, we implement an open accelerator repository to bridge hardware development and software development on one platform. On the hCODE platform, hardware developers can provide designs that follow hCODE specifications, which allowing software engineers to easily search, download, and integrate accelerators in their applications without caring about the hardware details. \u00a9 2017 Information Processing Society of Japan","alternate_title1":"IPSJ Trans.

There are several types of anemometers, with medium and high costs, such as cup, hot wire and pitot tubes, the hot wire being more sensitive and expensive than others. The device developed in this work is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US$ 50.00, using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer. The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet\/Brazil is R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments. As the reference anemometer (IPMet) has high embedded technology and the prototype is low cost, we conclude that the project has an attractive cost benefit for possible development and production, reaching the objective of this work.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Avallone, E","Mioralli, PC","Natividade, PSG","Palota, PH","da Costa, JF","Antonio, JR","Verderio, SA"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.2298\/FUEE1903359A","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"0353-3670","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"AN INEXPENSIVE ANEMOMETER USING ARDUINO BOARD","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"32","year":"2019","author_address":"[Avallone, Elson; Mioralli, Paulo Cesar; Gomes Natividade, Pablo Sampaio; Palota, Paulo Henrique; da Costa, Jose Ferreira; Antonio, Jonas Rafael; Verderio Junior, Silvio Aparecido] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Sao Paulo, Catanduva, SP, Brazil.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":null,"place_published":null,"publisher":"UNIV NIS","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":null,"short_title":null,"type_of_work":null,"accession_number":"WOS:000475451100004","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Avallone, Elson Mioralli, Paulo Cesar Gomes Natividade, Pablo Sampaio Palota, Paulo Henrique da Costa, Jose Ferreira Antonio, Jonas Rafael Verderio Junior, Silvio Aparecido","author_keywords":"Anemometer; low cost; airspeed measurement; Arduino; open hardware","beginning_page":"359","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"30","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"II8OK","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"2217-5997","email_address":"elson.avallone@ifsp.edu.br","ending_page":"368","funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Facta Univ.-Ser.

In this study, as a first step a 3d printer is constructed by modifying open source hardware and controlled by improving open source software. Subsequently, an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) is designed and constructed by using this 3d printer. The ankle foot orthosis, very important for human walking, is designed to control motion of the ankle and prevents deformities. An AFO can generally be used for following purposes: brace weak limbs, grasp ankle and foot in the right position and correct the foot drop. Since the users have different sizes of ankles and different types of deformities, an AFO must be produced to match in size to the end-user. Therefore off-the-shelf AFOs may not suitable for the each end user. Considering these factors, 3d printers are of great importance for producing individualized biomedical equipment. In this study, a distinctive ankle foot orthosis is first modelled by using CAD software and then produced by using constructed 3d printer. This AFO is the first ankle foot orthosis produced by a 3d printer in the literature of our country.

This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H\/W) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system.

The group just developed its first open-source CubeSat, the FloripaSat-I, which aims to empower students to develop space systems through a practical approach, where they have full control of the design and test of a real spacecraft. The project has already gone through all the stages of a CubeSat mission prior to the launching and operation stages. A prototype of the satellite, as well the engineering models 1 and 2 (EM-I and EM-II) were built. The expertise provided by the engineering models allows the development of a functional flight model (FM). This paper presents the validation and qualification tests that pass various FloripaSat-I models, from the engineering model to the flight model. All stages of the project are described, the tests performed in each phase, as well as the lessons learned.

The internal complexity of these rapid tests increases with the complexity of the diagnostic assay implemented by them. Some assays require precise temperature control (\u00b11\u00b0C\u20135\u00b0C) for an extended time (i.e. 15\u201360 minutes) for the reactions involved to run properly. Microheating components in them must meet strict criteria with respect to power consumption, physical size and cost. The proposed finite element model is intended to provide tools for in silico validation of device designs (geometries, structural materials), as well as to help in the interpretation of heat transfer processes inside the thermal system present in a molecular diagnostics device. The proposed model was developed for and validated with polyimide etched foil heating elements actively controlled via a mini-thermostat. The thermostat was designed for battery-based operation and implemented with open-source hardware (Arduino-compatible). Plastic test structures were created that emulated disposable Lab-on-a-Chip devices with microfluidic channels to hold liquid volumes on the scale of 0.1 mL. The experimental setup was demonstrated to maintain target temperatures over at least 30 minutes with at least \u00b11\u00b0C around the set point operated from batteries. Physical parameters of the resistive heating element used were fed into the finite element model and simulation results compared to the performance of the aforementioned experimental setup. \u00a9 2017 WIT Press.","alternate_title1":"Int.

For hardware development, the Bottom Up methodology was used, and Kanban methodology was used for the software.

The system automatizes the process of collecting the data in a continuous manner for long periods of time, for this, the module is equipped with a source of solar energy that allows autonomous operation. In order to obtain viability of design and prototype implementation, the construction of two systems was proposed based on DigiMesh and Wi-Fi; those prototypes could be applied to different scenarios such as urban and rural areas. Additionally, it was performed an evaluation of broadcasting of information to platforms of Internet of Things (IoT), where the data collected by the nodes will be managed and displayed. This system was conceived as a low-cost alternative compared with conventional weather stations that offer these facilities and are based on free hardware and software components. Finally, the validation of the obtained results was performed using a statistical analysis with the collected data of the weather station Davis Vantage Pro, obtaining a maximum average relative error of 4.93%.","alternate_title1":"Enfoque UTE","authors":["Qui\u00f1ones-Cuenca, Manuel","Gonz\u00e1lez-Jaramillo, V\u00edctor","Torres, Rommel","Jumbo, Miguel"],"database_provider":"http:\/\/www.scielo.org\/","date":"2017-02","doi":"10.29019\/enfoqueute.v8n1.139","end_page":"343","file_attachments1":"http:\/\/None\/pdf\/enfoqueute\/v8s1\/1390-6542-enfoqueute-8-s1-00329.pdf","id":"S1390-65422017000100329-ecu","issn":"1390-6542","journal_name":"Enfoque UTE","keywords":["Estaci\u00f3n meteorol\u00f3gica","medioambiente","RSI","IoT","Wi-Fi.","Environment","IoT","weather stations","Wi-Fi","WSN."],"language":"es","name_of_database":"SciELO Ecuador","number":"","start_page":"329","title":"Sistema De Monitoreo de Variables Medioambientales Usando Una Red de Sensores Inal\u00e1mbricos y Plataformas De Internet De Las Cosas","translated_title":"Monitoring System of Environmental Variables Using a Wireless Sensor Network and Platforms of Internet of Things","type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"http:\/\/scielo.senescyt.gob.ec\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1390-65422017000100329&lang=en","volume":"8","year":"2017","author_address":null,"custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":null,"place_published":null,"publisher":null,"secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":null,"short_title":null,"type_of_work":null,"accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":486,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and\/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.","alternate_title1":"Int. J. Comput. Intell.

These systems usually consist of sensing and actuating layer that is made up of sensors such as passive infrared sensors, also known as motion sensors; temperature sensors; smoke sensors, and web cameras for security surveillance. These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices.

That is the latest buzz arising from the Californian trade press. What do we get when this dictum is sampled with the old rallying cry: \"Information wants to be free\"? We suggest that the predominant, bounded critique of intellectual property is thereby destabilised. Constitutive of that critique was the exceptionality attributed to infor-mation goods (bits) vis-a-vis tangible goods (atoms). It was thus intellectual property could be presented as something altogether different from private property. We recognise that this way of framing the issue has had tactical advantages, but contend that it has stood in the way of a deeper understanding of what intellectual property is. When the critique of proprie-tary software is expanded by an emerging movement for open hardware development, however, the boundary between intellectual property and property as such crumbles. This enables us to renew our critique of the political economy of infor-mation.","alternate_title1":"TripleC","authors":["S\u00f6derberg, J.","Daoud, A."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.31269\/vol10iss1pp66-76","end_page":"76","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"1726670X (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Economic sociology","Hackers","Hacking","Information","New media studies","Open-hardware","Property","Science and technology studies"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"1","start_page":"66","title":"Atoms want to be free too! expanding the critique of in-tellectual property to physical goods","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856877033&doi=10.31269%2fvol10iss1pp66-76&partnerID=40&md5=11218737c14dee68dad8010a9df38d8e","volume":"10","year":"2012","author_address":"Department of Sociology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :9","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: S\u00f6derberg, J.; Department of Sociology, , Gothenburg, Sweden; email: johan.soderberg@sts.gu.se"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Unified Theory of Information Research Group","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"TripleC","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":489,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Two prominent social progressive movements are faced with a few contradictions and a paradox.

On the other, we have an emergent field of open and Commons-oriented peer production initiatives which create common pools of knowledge for the whole of humanity, but are dominated by start-ups and large multinational enterprises using the same Commons. Thus we have a paradox: the more communist the sharing license used in the peer production of free software or open hardware, the more capitalist the practice.

Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY\u2019s Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries\u2019 open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer. \u00a9 2019 DeBell, Goertzen, Larson, Selbie, Selker and Udell.","alternate_title1":"Front.

Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv\/Fm or Fq'\/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (\u03c3PSII or \u03c3PSII'). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 \u03bcmol photons m-2s-1) and high (200 \u03bcmol photons m-2 s-1) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell-1 decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv\/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'\/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'\/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research. \u00a9 \u00a9 2017 Hoadley and Warner.","alternate_title1":"Front.

This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with \u00b5Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca 2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take \u223c1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed. \u00a9 2019 Battefeld, Popovic, van der Werf and Kole.","alternate_title1":"Front.

Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment\/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware\/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Remote Sens.","authors":["Stanghellini, G.","Del Bianco, F.","Gasperini, L."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/RS12162575","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"20724292 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV)","Marine geophysics","NAIADI Project (New Autonomous\/automatIc systems for the study AnD monitoring of aquatic envIronments)","Repeated 4D surveys","Shallow water environments","Architecture","Computer architecture","Costs","Geological surveys","Geophysics","Hydrographic surveys","Stratigraphy","Unmanned surface vehicles","Autonomous surface vehicles","Conventional systems","Multibeam echo sounder","Planning and execution","Sediment\/water interfaces","Seismic reflections","Shallow water environment","Stratigraphic changes","Autonomous vehicles"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"16","start_page":null,"title":"OpenSWAP, an open architecture, low cost class of autonomous surface vehicles for geophysical surveys in the shallow water environment","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090092490&doi=10.3390%2fRS12162575&partnerID=40&md5=89bbb08b3d6fccea7b636b818cd86bb0","volume":"12","year":"2020","author_address":"[Stanghellini, Giuseppe; Gasperini, Luca] CNR, UO Geol Marina, Ist Sci Marine, ISMAR CNR, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.

IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km2) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa\/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Symmetry","authors":["Choi, R.","Lee, S.","Lee, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/SYM12040552","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"20738994 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Automatic repeat request (AQR)","Internet of things (IoT)","LoRa","LoRaWAN","Low power wide area network (LPWAN)","Open hardware","Open source"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":null,"title":"Reliability improvement of lora with ARQ and relay node","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087061718&doi=10.3390%2fSYM12040552&partnerID=40&md5=571d2025462a326a60dca6ba7289c5a9","volume":"12","year":"2020","author_address":"[Choi, Rocksan] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea.

The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Appl.

Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20\u00b0 platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US $ 37 in parts, which is 1\/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities. The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Appl.

We developed OPENDROP, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OPENDROP consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OPENDROP, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47% of attempts to replicate OPENDROP were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device.

Consumers can save substantial money by offsetting purchases with DIY pre-designed 3-D printed products. However, even more value can be obtained with distributed manufacturing using mass customization. Unfortunately, the average consumer is not technically sophisticated enough to easily design their own products. One solution to this is the use of an overlay on OpenSCAD parametric code, although current solutions force users to relinquish all rights to their own designs. There is thus a substantial need in the open source design community for a libre 3-D model customizer, which can be used in any design repository to democratize design. This study reports on the design, function, and validation of such software: the Free Open Source 3-D Customizer. It is demonstrated with a case study of the customization of 3-D printable external breast prosthetics. The results showed that novice users can adjust the available parameters according to their needs and save these to a new file on a website. This PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) library is free and open source and has potential for increasing the usefulness of online repositories to enable distributed manufacturing using consumer customized 3-D printable products. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

In part due to these cost savings, the manufacturing of scientific equipment is beginning to move away from a central paradigm of purchasing proprietary equipment to one in which scientists themselves download open-source designs, fabricate components with digital manufacturing technology, and then assemble the equipment themselves. This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under $20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications. By designing using open-source principles and the proposed procedures, the outcome will be customizable, under control of the researcher, less expensive than commercial options, more maintainable, and will have many applications that benefit the user since the design documentation is open and freely accessible. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

Unfortunately, demonstrated systems have high capital costs, which limits access for the poor. The most expensive component of such systems is the heat exchanger (HX). Thus, this study focuses on cost optimization of HX designs for flow-through SWPs using high-effectiveness polymer microchannel HXs. The theoretical foundation for the cost optimization of a polymer microchannel HX is provided, and outputs are plotted in order to provide guidelines for designers to perform HX optimizations. These plots are used in two case studies: (1) substitution of a coiled copper HX with polymer microchannel HX, and (2) design of a polymer microchannel HX for a 3-D printed collector that can fit in an arbitrary build volume. The results show that substitution of the polymer expanded HX reduced the overall expenditure for the system by a factor 50, which aids in making the system more economical. For the second case study, the results show how future system designers can optimize an HX for an arbitrary SWP geometry. The approach of distributed manufacturing using laser welding appears promising for HX for SWP. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

How to use IoT to improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students\u2019 identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms, such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students\u2019 behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen the motivation of students\u2019 learning. This IoT system can improve the attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students\u2019 learning process for higher education. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8WPV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements.

This situation has produced different effects in today\u2019s society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers\u2019 community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

The proposed system can be replicated for educational or research purposes without having wide knowledge about electronic engineering. Using standard calibrated instrumentation, commonly available in any laboratory, the accuracy of measurements is ensured. A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is also provided. Finally, the proposed system is validated by comparing the results obtained from some commercial photovoltaic modules to the measurements given by an independently accredited laboratory. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Energies","authors":["Montes-Romero, J.","Piliougine, M.","Mu\u00f1oz, J.V.","Fern\u00e1ndez, E.F.","De La Casa, J."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/en10111869","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"19961073 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Characterization system","I-V curve","Outdoor measurements","Uncertainty analysis","Computer programming languages","Photovoltaic cells","Accredited laboratories","Accuracy of measurements","Current voltage curve","Electrical characteristic","I - V curve","Outdoor measurements","Standard test condition (STC)","Uncertainty of measurement","Uncertainty analysis"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"11","start_page":null,"title":"Photovoltaic device performance evaluation using an open-hardware system and standard calibrated laboratory instruments","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036646729&doi=10.3390%2fen10111869&partnerID=40&md5=99299a42c5c08ef418def5be2758526e","volume":"10","year":"2017","author_address":"[Montes-Romero, Jesus; Vicente Munoz, Jose; Fernandez, Eduardo F.; de la Casa, Juan] Univ Jaen, IDEA Res Grp, Campus Lagunillas, Jaen 23071, Spain.

To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines. \u00a9 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach with 3-D printing. The results showed how the Free Inactive Patent Search enables users to search using plain language text to find public domain concepts and then provides a hyperlinked list of ideas that takes users to the USPTO database for the patent for more information. All of the source code to operate the search and the website are open source themselves and provided in the public domain for free. In the case study on 3-D printing the time to identify public domain patents was cut by a factor of more than 1500.

These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP.

To overcome these barriers, this study provides open source (OS) designs for a low-cost circuit milling machine. First, design modifications for mechanical and electrical subsystems of the OS Distributed 3-D (D3D) Robotics prototyping system are provided. Next, Copper Carve, an OS custom graphical user interface, is developed to enable circuit board milling by implementing backlash and substrate distortion compensation. The performance of the OS D3D circuit mill is then quantified and validated for: positional accuracy, cut quality, feature accuracy, and distortion compensation. Finally, the return on investment is calculated for inventors using it. The results show by properly compensating for motion inaccuracies with Copper Carve, the machine achieves a motion resolution of 10 microns, which is more than adequate for most circuit designs. The mill is at least five times less expensive than all commercial alternatives and the material costs of the D3D mill are repaid from fabricating 20\u201343 boards. The results show that the OS circuit mill is of high-enough quality to enable rapid invention and distributed manufacturing of complex products containing custom electronics. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

The system itself can be largely fabricated using FPF\/FGF following the self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) methodology.

The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software.

Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur, researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost $170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost $163 to fabricate, plus an additional cost of $2 per month for cellular network access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable, successfully transferring 95% of sensor data to the internet website. Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts. \u00a9 2018 by the authors","alternate_title1":"J.

This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M\u03a9 show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Mater.","authors":["Chandra, H.","Allen, S.W.","Oberloier, S.W.","Bihari, N.","Gwamuri, J.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/ma10020110","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"19961944 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3-D platform","Conductivity","Four-point probe","Indium tin oxide","ITO","Libre hardware","Open source hardware","Sheet resistance","TCO","Transparent conducting oxide","Annealing","Automation","Electric conductivity","Firmware","Hardware","Indium","Mapping","Open systems","Printing machinery","Printing presses","Probes","Resistors","Sheet resistance","Software engineering","Tin","Tin oxides","3-D platform","Four point probe","Indium tin oxide","Open-source hardwares","Transparent conducting oxide","Open source software"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"2","start_page":null,"title":"Open-source automated mapping four-point probe","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013860771&doi=10.3390%2fma10020110&partnerID=40&md5=c832388a2796f66ff08cbef7dab20754","volume":"10","year":"2017","author_address":"[Chandra, Handy; Allen, Spencer W.; Oberloier, Shane W.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

Several polymers have been tested, but sodium alginate is in widespread use for cell encapsulation applications, due to its low toxicity and easy manipulation. Different cell encapsulation methods have been described in the literature using pressure differences or electrostatic changes with high cost commercial devices (about 30,000 US dollars). Herein, a low-cost device (about 100 US dollars) that can be created by commercial syringes or 3D printer devices has been developed. The capsules, whose diameter is around 500 \u00b5m and can decrease or increase according to the pressure applied to the system, is able to maintain cells viable and functional. The hydrogel porosity of the capsule indicates that the immune system is not capable of destroying host cells, demonstrating that new studies can be developed for cell therapy at low cost with microencapsulation production. This device may aid pre-clinical and clinical projects in low-and middle-income countries and is lined up with open source equipment devices. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Initially used as a means to develop freely-available software, open source projects have been applied to hardware including scientific tools. Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Micromachines","authors":["Brennan, M.D.","Bokhari, F.F.","Eddington, D.T."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/mi9040191","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2072666X (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3D printing","Functional prototyping","Open source labware","3D printers","Hardware","Open source software","Open systems","Syringes","3-D printing","Commercial products","Freely available software","Open source projects","Open sources","Open-source model","Scientific community","Scientific tool","ISO Standards"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":null,"title":"Open design 3D-printable adjustable micropipette that meets the ISO standard for accuracy","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045738200&doi=10.3390%2fmi9040191&partnerID=40&md5=4b2a032f437e8fee1383aa8da9fcc8e0","volume":"9","year":"2018","author_address":"[Brennan, Martin D.; Bokhari, Fahad F.; Eddington, David T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Bioengn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"191","notes":["Cited By :5","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Eddington, D.T.; Department of Bioengineering, United States; email: dte@uic.edu"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"MDPI AG","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Micromachines","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000434880200053","article_number":"191","author_full_name":"Brennan, Martin D.

In the last two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously, the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a dreadful \"chip-in-a-lab\"-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future perspectives. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Micromachines","authors":["Nguyen, T.","Andreasen, S.Z.","Wolff, A.","Bang, D.D."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/mi9080403","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2072666X (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino","Lab on a chip","Microcontroller","Open source hardware","Point of care device"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"8","start_page":null,"title":"From lab on a chip to point of care devices: The role of open source microcontrollers","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051829516&doi=10.3390%2fmi9080403&partnerID=40&md5=e0dc224cc6335d16a8e4756ad66c9fa2","volume":"9","year":"2018","author_address":"[Trieu Nguyen; Bang, Dang Duong] Tech Univ Denmark DTU Food, Natl Food Inst, Lab Appl Micro & Nanotechnol LAMINATE, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker- and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large. \u00a9 2016 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Remote Sens.","authors":["Busch, J.A.","Bardaji, R.","Ceccaroni, L.","Friedrichs, A.","Piera, J.","Simon, C.","Thijsse, P.","Wernand, M.","van derWoerd, H.J.","Zielinski, O."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/rs8110879","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"20724292 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Aquatic optics","Citizen's applications for earth surveillance","Data repositories","DIY","Emerging technologies","Incentives to mobilize the crowd","Interoperability","Open access","Open labware","Smartphones","Interoperability","Remote sensing","Smartphones","Water quality","Data repositories","Emerging technologies","Incentives to mobilize the crowd","Open Access","Open labware","Digital storage"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"11","start_page":null,"title":"Citizen bio-optical observations from coast- and ocean and their compatibility with ocean colour satellite measurements","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032068870&doi=10.3390%2frs8110879&partnerID=40&md5=92a41c7f8c6bfe854ba0b4451d917a0a","volume":"8","year":"2016","author_address":"[Busch, Julia A.; Friedrichs, Anna; Zielinski, Oliver] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Schleusenstr 1, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.

This paper provides a methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories. \u00a9 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Anzalone, G.C.","Glover, A.G.","Pearce, J.M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s130405338","end_page":"5346","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["3-D printer","Arduino","Chemical oxygen demand","COD","Colorimetery","Open source","Open-source colorimeter","Open-source hardware","Open-source sensor","RepRap","Arduino","COD","Colorimetery","Open sources","Open-source","Open-source hardwares","RepRap","Chemical oxygen demand","Color","Colorimetry","Developing countries","Hardware","Open systems","Sensors","Colorimeters"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"4","start_page":"5338","title":"Open-source colorimeter","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877350057&doi=10.3390%2fs130405338&partnerID=40&md5=1f87fe402451d7742775c93d3dc6385d","volume":"13","year":"2013","author_address":"[Anzalone, Gerald C.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost \u2015open hardware\u2016 platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 &lt; 0.1 mS\/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies. \u00a9 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Bitella, G.","Rossi, R.","Bochicchio, R.","Perniola, M.","Amato, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s141019639","end_page":"19659","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino","Contactless temperature sensor","Infrared thermometry","Microcontroller","Multi-sensor platform","Open-hardware","Soil water content","Wireless data","Agronomy","Computer hardware","Costs","Hardware","Mean square error","Microcontrollers","Open source software","Soil moisture","Sustainable development","Temperature sensors","Web services","Arduino","Contactless temperature sensors","Infrared thermometry","Multi-sensor platforms","Soil water content","Wireless data","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"10","start_page":"19639","title":"A novel low-cost open-hardware platform for monitoring soil water content and multiple soil-air-vegetation parameters","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908537939&doi=10.3390%2fs141019639&partnerID=40&md5=f5024ba9ab91a758b2cf3bbee6a9396a","volume":"14","year":"2014","author_address":"[Bitella, Giovanni; Bochicchio, Rocco; Perniola, Michele; Amato, Mariana] Univ Basilicata, Sch Agr Forestry Food & Environm Sci, I-85100 Potenza, Italy.

The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP\/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented. \u00a9 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Trilles, S.","Luj\u00e1n, A.","Belmonte, \u00d3.","Montoliu, R.","Torres-Sospedra, J.","Huerta, J."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s150305555","end_page":"5582","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Internet of things","Interoperability","OGC sensorthings API","Open hardware","Sensorized platform","Web of things","Wireless sensor networks","Digital storage","Hardware","HTTP","Internet","Internet of things","Interoperability","Sensor nodes","Social networking (online)","Wireless sensor networks","World Wide Web","Environmental conditions","OGC sensorthings API","Open geospatial consortium","Open hardware","Proposed architectures","Sensorized platform","Web of things","Wireless sensor node","Internet protocols"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"5555","title":"SEnviro: A sensorized platform proposal using open hardware and open standards","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928693201&doi=10.3390%2fs150305555&partnerID=40&md5=a137959641ed85c58d691178f492459b","volume":"15","year":"2015","author_address":"[Trilles, Sergio; Lujan, Alejandro; Belmonte, Oscar; Montoliu, Raul; Torres-Sospedra, Joaquin; Huerta, Joaquin] Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :25","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Trilles, S.; Institute of New Imaging Technologies, Universitat Jaume I, Av.

At the \u2018thing\u2019 level\u2014devices and inter-device network communication\u2014the core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. \u00a9 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Fisher, R.","Ledwaba, L.","Hancke, G.","Kruger, C."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s150306818","end_page":"6844","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Industrial networks","Internet of Things","Machine to machine","Smart grid","Wireless sensor network","Intelligent buildings","Internet","Internet of things","Sensor nodes","Wireless sensor networks","Commercial Devices","Embedded platforms","Industrial networks","Intelligent devices","Machine to machines","Network communications","Off-the-shelf components","Smart grid","Gateways (computer networks)"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"6818","title":"Open hardware: A role to play in wireless sensor networks?","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928661924&doi=10.3390%2fs150306818&partnerID=40&md5=b7e9b64582018a5bc5808f404146e797","volume":"15","year":"2015","author_address":"[Fisher, Roy; Kruger, Carel] Univ Pretoria, Adv Sensor Networks Res Grp, ZA-0083 Pretoria, South Africa.

Such a system provides for the use of an electric pump for the circulation of heat transfer fluid connecting the solar thermal panel to the storage tank. The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display. \u00a9 2015 by the authors;

One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation Kd coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Bardaji, R.","S\u00e1nchez, A.-M.","Simon, C.","Wernand, M.R.","Piera, J."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s16030373","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino","Buoy","Citizen science","Diffuse attenuation coefficient","Do-it-yourself","KdUINO","Light","Low-cost sensor","Oceanography","Buoys","Data acquisition","Embedded systems","Light","Oceanography","Transparency","Water quality","Arduino","Citizen science","Diffuse attenuation coefficients","Do it yourself","KdUINO","Low-cost sensors","Costs"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":null,"title":"Estimating the underwater diffuse attenuation coefficient with a low-cost instrument: The KdUINO DIY buoy","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961249487&doi=10.3390%2fs16030373&partnerID=40&md5=8f707565c77f1681bd8d908910b2de48","volume":"16","year":"2016","author_address":"[Bardaji, Raul; Sanchez, Albert-Miquel; Simon, Carine; Piera, Jaume] CSIC, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Phys & Technol Oceanog, ICM, 37-49 Passeig Maritim Barceloneta, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.

Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Piromalis, D.","Arvanitis, K."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s16081227","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Actuators","Agriculture","Arduino","ARM","Energy management","Expandable platforms","Networks","Open-source","Sensors","Wireless","Actuators","Agriculture","Computer hardware","Design","Energy management","Hardware","Network architecture","Networks (circuits)","Radio","Reconfigurable architectures","Reconfigurable hardware","Sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Arduino","Expandable platforms","Functional requirement","Open sources","Proposed architectures","Real-life implementations","Socio-economic impacts","Wireless sensor and actuators","Open systems","agriculture","computer network","devices","equipment design","human","telemetry","wireless communication","Agriculture","Computer Communication Networks","Equipment Design","Humans","Telemetry","Wireless Technology"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"8","start_page":null,"title":"Sensotube: A scalable hardware design architecture for wireless sensors and actuators networks nodes in the agricultural domain","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982746790&doi=10.3390%2fs16081227&partnerID=40&md5=b908f66daf7e8ded3d6824a7fdc509b6","volume":"16","year":"2016","author_address":"[Piromalis, Dimitrios; Arvanitis, Konstantinos] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Iera Odoos 75, Athens 11855, Greece.

Therefore, monitoring parameters involved in the deterioration process, principally temperature and relative humidity, is useful for preventive conservation. In this study, a total of 15 microclimate stations using open source hardware were developed and stationed at the Mosque-Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba, which is registered with UNESCO for its outstanding universal value, to assess the behavior of interior temperature and relative humidity in relation to exterior weather conditions, public hours and interior design. Long-term monitoring of these parameters is of interest in terms of preservation and reducing the costs of future conservation strategies. Results from monitoring are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this system. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Mesas-Carrascosa, F.J.","Verd\u00fa Santano, D.","de Larriva, J.E.M.","Ort\u00edz Cordero, R.","Hidalgo Fern\u00e1ndez, R.E.","Garc\u00eda-Ferrer, A."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s16101620","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Cultural heritage","Open source hardware","Relative humidity and temperature monitoring","Architectural design","Hardware","Open systems","Reconfigurable hardware","Conservation strategies","Cultural heritages","Deterioration process","Monitoring parameters","Open-source hardwares","Preventive conservation","Relative humidity and temperatures","Temperature and relative humidity","C (programming language)"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"10","start_page":null,"title":"Monitoring heritage buildings with open source hardware sensors: A case study of the mosque-cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84990909332&doi=10.3390%2fs16101620&partnerID=40&md5=5c8e38605e462c4a6666d92b0d7fc9e2","volume":"16","year":"2016","author_address":"[Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier; Santano, Daniel Verdu; de Larriva, Jose Emilio Merono; Cordero, Rafael Ortiz; Fernandez, Rafael Enrique Hidalgo; Garcia-Ferrer, Alfonso] Univ Cordoba, Dept Graph Engn & Geomat, Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":"1620","notes":["Cited By :25","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Mesas-Carrascosa, F.J.; Department of Graphic Engineering and Geomatics, Campus de Rabanales, Spain; email: fjmesas@uco.es"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"MDPI AG","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Sensors (Switzerland)","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000386131600072","article_number":"1620","author_full_name":"Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier Santano, Daniel Verdu de Larriva, Jose Emilio Merono Cordero, Rafael Ortiz Fernandez, Rafael Enrique Hidalgo Garcia-Ferrer, Alfonso","author_keywords":"relative humidity and temperature monitoring; cultural heritage; open source hardware","beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"35","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"DZ8OY","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"1424-8220","email_address":"fjmesas@uco.es; p12vesad@uco.es; jemerono@uco.es; p82orcor@uco.es; ig1hifer@uco.es; agferrer@uco.es","ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":"Cabildo Catedralicio of Cordoba","funding_text":"The authors would like to thank the Cabildo Catedralicio of Cordoba for support this Project.","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Sensors","issue":"10","keywords_plus":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE; CULTURAL-HERITAGE; PREVENTIVE CONSERVATION; MICROCLIMATE; SYSTEM; ACQUISITION; ENVIRONMENT; PARAMETERS; POMPEII; HOUSE","meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":"DOAJ Gold, Green Published","orcid_id":"de Larriva, Jose Emilio Merono\/0000-0002-9857-4808; Garcia-Ferrer, Alfonso\/0000-0002-7558-400X; Ortiz-Cordero, Rafael\/0000-0001-9910-7016; Hidalgo Fernandez, Rafael Enrique\/0000-0002-4384-6220; Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier\/0000-0002-5674-1292","page_count":"14","part_number":null,"publication_date":"OCT","publication_name":"SENSORS","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","publisher_city":"BASEL","pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":"Mesas-Carrascosa, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Graph Engn & Geomat, Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.","research_areas":"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","researcher_id":"de Larriva, Jose Emilio Merono\/Q-6245-2019; Garcia-Ferrer, Alfonso\/Q-8365-2019; Garcia-Ferrer, Alfonso\/K-7322-2017; Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier\/L-3094-2017","source_abbreviation_29c":"SENSORS-BASEL","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"13","usage_count_180":"0","usage_count_2013":"19","wos_categories":"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"13"},{"index":541,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP\/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)\u2014this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS\u2014located on the user\u2019s computer.

The system allows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recorded with a 24-bit EEG system with minimum bandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication. \u00a9 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Avery, J.","Dowrick, T.","Faulkner, M.","Goren, N.","Holder, D."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s17020280","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Arduino","Brain imaging","Electrical impedance tomography","Evoked activity","Long term monitoring","Open source hardware","Brain","Brain mapping","Data handling","Electric impedance","Electric impedance measurement","Electric impedance tomography","Electrodes","Hardware","Neuroimaging","Open source software","Polychlorinated biphenyls","Printed circuit boards","Tomography","Arduino","Brain imaging","Electrical impedance tomography","Long term monitoring","Open-source hardwares","Open systems","animal","electrode","human","imaging phantom","impedance","tomography","x-ray computed tomography","Animals","Electric Impedance","Electrodes","Humans","Phantoms, Imaging","Tomography","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"2","start_page":null,"title":"A versatile and reproducible multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography system","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011650068&doi=10.3390%2fs17020280&partnerID=40&md5=a958f898ae7de518eb1e120cf976bd49","volume":"17","year":"2017","author_address":"[Avery, James; Dowrick, Thomas; Faulkner, Mayo; Goren, Nir; Holder, David] UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England.","custom2":"28146122","custom3":null,"custom7":"280","notes":["Cited By :49","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Avery, J.; Department Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, United Kingdom; email: j.avery@ucl.ac.uk"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"MDPI AG","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Sensors (Switzerland)","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000395482700064","article_number":"280","author_full_name":"Avery, James Dowrick, Thomas Faulkner, Mayo Goren, Nir Holder, David","author_keywords":"Electrical Impedance Tomography; brain imaging; long term monitoring; evoked activity; open source hardware; Arduino","beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"51","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"EM7HS","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"1424-8220","email_address":"j.avery@ucl.ac.uk; t.dowrick@ucl.ac.uk; mayo.faulkner@ucl.ac.uk; n.goren@ucl.ac.uk; d.holder@ucl.ac.uk","ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":"EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP\/M506448\/1]; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR\/K00767X\/1]","funding_text":"This work was supported by EPSRC grant EP\/M506448\/1 and MRC grant MR\/K00767X\/1.","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Sensors","issue":"2","keywords_plus":"FREQUENCY-DIFFERENCE EIT; ANESTHETIZED RAT; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN-FUNCTION; STROKE; CORTEX; MODEL; VALIDATION; PHANTOM; FMRI","meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":"DOAJ Gold, Green Published","orcid_id":"holder, david\/0000-0003-2755-6124; Avery, James\/0000-0002-4015-1802","page_count":"20","part_number":null,"publication_date":"FEB","publication_name":"SENSORS","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","publisher_city":"BASEL","pubmed_id":"28146122","reprint_address":"Avery, J (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England.","research_areas":"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","researcher_id":"; Avery, James\/C-8526-2018","source_abbreviation_29c":"SENSORS-BASEL","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"48","usage_count_180":"0","usage_count_2013":"18","wos_categories":"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"48"},{"index":543,"__source":["scopus.ris","wos1-500.ciw"],"abstract":"Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain.

These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m\/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.

The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and intuitive. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream\u2014such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system\u2019s control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios\u2014low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)\u2014demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC\/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed\/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering\/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Viciana, E.","Alcayde, A.","Montoya, F.G.","Ba\u00f1os, R.","Arrabal-Campos, F.M.","Manzano-Agugliaro, F."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s19030627","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Electricity","Energy metering","Low cost","Network analyser","Power quality","Smart meter","Costs","Electric power measurement","Electricity","Energy conservation","Information management","Internet of things","Online systems","Open systems","Quality control","Renewable energy resources","Smart meters","Energy metering","Hardware implementations","Internet of Things (IOT)","Low costs","Low-voltage power systems","Power quality measurements","Renewable energy source","Traditional power system","Power quality"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":null,"title":"An open hardware design for internet of things power quality and energy saving solutions","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061135766&doi=10.3390%2fs19030627&partnerID=40&md5=c07d5677bf6eec7baf93ada08241cdb3","volume":"19","year":"2019","author_address":"[Viciana, Eduardo; Alcayde, Alfredo; Montoya, Francisco G.; Banos, Raul; Arrabal-Campos, Francisco M.; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco] Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain.","custom2":"30717225","custom3":null,"custom7":"627","notes":["Cited By :12","Export Date: 18 February 2021","Correspondence Address: Montoya, F.G.; Department of Engineering, Spain; email: pagilm@ual.es"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"MDPI AG","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Sensors (Switzerland)","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000459941200190","article_number":"627","author_full_name":"Viciana, Eduardo Alcayde, Alfredo Montoya, Francisco G.

However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave\u2019s DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

For the autonomous grasping mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them. Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation tasks. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, suitable methods for the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity\u2013electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs.

This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and low signal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform (shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signals with better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added\/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule\u2010based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects.

Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device\u2019s several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples\/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Different implementations are commercially available from the industry and yet there is quite an interest from the scientific community to spread its use to the majority of society by means of cost effectiveness and ease of use for solutions. These devices make the most sense when combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), going a step further and alleviating repetitive routines which could be strenuous if traditional methods were adopted. In this work, a low cost and modular solution for a multispectral camera is presented, based on the use of a single panchromatic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor combined with a rotating wheel of interchangeable band pass optic filters. The system is compatible with open source hardware permitting one to capture, process, store and\/or transmit data if needed. In addition, a calibration and characterization methodology has been developed for the camera, allowing not only for quantifying its performance, but also able to characterize other CMOS sensors in the market in order to select the one that best suits the budget and application. The process was experimentally validated by mounting the camera in a Dji Matrice 600 UAV to uncover vegetation indices in a reduced area of palm trees plantation. Results are presented for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showing a generated colored map with the captured information. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Nowadays, industrial advances make the electronic stages in these systems obsolete compared to the mechanical elements, which generates a recurring problem in technological, commercial and industrial applications. This article presents a methodology for the development of an open-architecture controller that is based on reconfigurable hardware under the open source concept for servo applications. The most outstanding contribution of this paper is the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for online self tuning with a focus on both high-quality servo control and reduction of vibrations during the positioning of a linear motion system. The proposed techniques have been validated on a real platform and form a novel, effective approach as compared to the conventional tuning methods that employ empirical or analytical solutions and cannot improve their parameter set. The controller was elaborated from the Graphical User Interface to the logical implementation while using free tools. This approach also allows for modification and updates to be made easily, thereby reducing the susceptibility to obsolescence. A comparison of the logical implementation with the manufacturer software was also conducted in order to test the performance of free tools in FPGAs. The Graphical User Interface developed in Python presents features, such as speed profiling, controller auto-tuning, measurement of main parameters, and monitoring of servo system vibrations. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his\/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge.

The sensor, based on instantaneous measurements, functions as a position server for dual\u2010axis solar trackers in photovoltaic plants. The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun\u2019s position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual\u2010axis solar tracking with a low\u2010cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The experimental results reveal the relevance of using the Open Hardware and Software motes when setting up outdoor wireless sensor networks. \u00a9 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.","alternate_title1":"Sensors","authors":["Bagula, A.B.","Inggs, G.","Scott, S.","Zennaro, M."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3390\/s90604845","end_page":"4868","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"14248220 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Energy efficiency","Open motes squidbee","Wireless sensor networks","Battery lifetime","Environment monitoring","Environment monitoring system","Field deployment","Open hardware","Open motes squidbee","Received signal strength","Sensing performance","Energy efficiency","Hardware","Molluscs","Wireless sensor networks"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"6","start_page":"4845","title":"On the Relevance of Using Open Wireless Sensor Networks in Environment Monitoring","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70849092749&doi=10.3390%2fs90604845&partnerID=40&md5=048da6fa455ad0711b034e55122f7085","volume":"9","year":"2009","author_address":"[Bagula, Antoine B.; Inggs, Gordon; Scott, Simon] Univ Cape Town, Dept Comp Sci, ZA-7707 Cape Town, South Africa.

The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum.

The main challenge for obtaining such a product was the large number of hardware and software components to be integrated, passing points as diverse as a Raspberry with its Grandstream interface adapter, Asterisk with its trunk and protocol contexts, platforms such as AWS and Docker. It is important to highlight that the stated objectives were achieved, obtaining a functional, resilient and scalable solution where complexity is centralized in the components hosted in the cloud. In this way, the benefits of virtualization and consolidation in the cloud have been extended to telephony in recent years.

The project involves several technological innovations, including portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4\u00b0 and best accuracy below 0.3\u00b0, and with a typical precision (SD method) around 0.3\u00b0 and best precision below 0.2\u00b0. Part of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts. \u00a9 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","alternate_title1":"Behav. Res.

The CloudThink infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure and set will accelerate its adoption. \u00a9 2015 \u00a9 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","alternate_title1":"Transport","authors":["Wilhelm, E.","Siegel, J.","Mayer, S.","Sadamori, L.","Dsouza, S.","Chau, C.-K.","Sarma, S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.3846\/16484142.2015.1079237","end_page":"329","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"16484142 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["cloud theory","data security","eSafety","information system","intelligent transport system","Access control","Application programming interfaces (API)","Digital storage","Fuel economy","Information systems","Intelligent systems","Motor transportation","Open source software","Open systems","Security of data","Traffic control","Transportation","Vehicles","Wireless telecommunication systems","Cloud theory","eSafety","Intelligent transport systems","Multiple applications","Open-source hardwares","Third party services","Transportation system","Vehicle communications","Vehicle to vehicle communications"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"3","start_page":"320","title":"Cloudthink: A scalable secure platform for mirroring transportation systems in the cloud","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942888628&doi=10.3846%2f16484142.2015.1079237&partnerID=40&md5=48cfedfd63fd1cba9715b7140ec0afe8","volume":"30","year":"2015","author_address":"[Wilhelm, Erik] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore.

While the percentage of elderly population was 25% in 2000 it is projected that it will reach 40% in 2020 and exceed 50% in 2050. The rapid increase of elderly population is leading to the decrease of productive population. It will also cause an aggravation of domestic productivity. Productivity decline due to the increase of elderly population can become visible within a few years. Information communication technology is finding ways to respond to this problem. Smart technology can enhance productivity through automation and intellectualization in a simple and repetitive labor field. Among smart technologies, the development of IoT technology has been carried out actively. Many examples that can increase productivity using IoT have been suggested widely. This study will describe the development of IoT using open source software and hardware that can minimize the development time of IoT technology. With examples of applying IoT technology to home automation for the development of a similar system in the future, this study seeks to suggest that productivity improvement using IoT communication to solve the problems of the decrease in productive population and productivity decline. In order to show that the issue of productivity decline due to aging can be solved using open source technology, this study suggested a direction by developing home automation using open source hardware and software. \u00a9 2018, Medwell Journals.","alternate_title1":"J.

This paper aims to descriptively disseminate the concept of horizontal integration with emphasize on Internet of Things (IoT) from research in tropical functional food resources to teaching excellence framework. The five-stage framework includes (1) vision internalization, (2) persistence propagation, (3) new technology adaptation, (4) extending collaboration, and (5) outcome integration. The vision internalization stage produces a better understanding of the big picture and systematic approach. The experience is then brought to Research Methodology and Research Design classes. Persistence propagation may be better translated to relentlessly solving the problem and to increase the laboratory power, including providing fail-safe and verification procedures of possibly dubious results produced in the laboratory. The research may improve operating procedures or methods in a laboratory manual. The movement of open hardware dan IoTmakes it possible for faster technology adaptation to food-laboratory. IoT is integrated into the closest courses. When an integration requires expansion and collaboration, students are prepared to conduct functional food research in partner laboratories. The outcome integration fully materialized when enough new and related knowledge are accumulated. Researchers may visit and align the current curriculum in the subject of Functional Food Technology.

Arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform that has been widely popular in the past decade among hobbyists and academics. Arduino is increasingly being adopted in courses that span different disciplines in schools and universities. As a result, numerous papers are being published every year in different engineering education conferences and journals reporting the integration of Arduino in teaching. In this work, the impact of Arduino on embedded systems education is investigated. First, challenges facing embedded systems education are identified from the literature. Second, different Arduino teaching integration methodologies reported in the literature are surveyed and analyzed. Third, the question whether Arduino successfully addresses embedded education challenges or not is discussed taking both surveyed findings and recent market trends into consideration.

By combining commercially-available hardware, pattern-matching techniques and programming skills, we are able to foster students' interest on developing innovative potentiallymarketable systems. This freeware project, implemented as a configurable publicly-available library, can be adapted to the needs of any course or student. In our laboratory this open-source DLL is used for remotely controlling a robot (based on an open-hardware Arduino platform), using a PC and the Wiimote, although the DLL can be integrated in any C, C++, Java or C# project. A GUI application (based on a Model-View-Presenter paradigm) is also provided and can be used as a template for new applications or just for debugging purposes.

The platform proposed here is intended for research which trades smaller population size with more sophisticated individual robot capabilities. The validation of proposed swarm robotic algorithms using real-world hardware is essential, but is fraught with difficulty due to the expense and complexity of developing and maintaining multiple operational units. A number of open hardware platforms have been proposed, although most prioritize small size and low cost over advanced capabilities such as vision. We are interested in a number of different research directions which utilize vision as a core capability and find the existing open hardware platforms to be insufficient (and existing commercial platforms too expensive). In this paper we describe a set of desirable characteristics for an open, extensible visually-guided robot platform. We then present our solution, the BuPiGo (pronounced buppy-go), describing the hardware itself and a model developed for simulation purposes. We also present some initial results on using the BuPiGo for visual homing an individual navigation task that we hope to exploit for swarm tasks in the future.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Vardy, A","Shiell, N"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":"10.4108\/eai.3-12-2015.2262522","end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2032-9407","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"English","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"BuPiGo: An Open and Extensible Platform for Visually-Guided Swarm Robots","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"3","year":"2016","author_address":"[Vardy, Andrew] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Sci, St John, NF, Canada.

It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM\/GPRS technology and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog Gateways scheme in real-time application. \u00a9 2018, Chulalongkorn University.

A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer. A 23 factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peakto-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed. The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly. With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle. \u00a9 2020, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

Yet there are a number of reasons why it has not yet seen wide proliferation in the commercial vehicle industry. First, until recently, hardware-in-the-loop testing required the use of expensive special-purpose hardware solutions to achieve the needed real-time performance. Second, the development of highly accurate real-time-capable models of diesel engines, transmissions and complete vehicles was prohibitively labor-intensive. Third, the development of test cases required special programming skills. Fourth, the test cases were not portable from one controller program to the next, which limited their re-use. In recent years the performance and user-friendliness of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software products have changed to the point that they can now be used in very complex and sophisticated HIL test systems for automobiles and commercial vehicles. As a result, these next generation HIL systems are Built on open hardware and software architectures derived from PCs. This reduces long-term cost of ownership by a substantial amount. Capable of running simulation tools and plant models from many different origins and vendors in real-time. This reduces the effort in developing high-fidelity real-time models for the purpose of HIL testing by a large amount. Capable of running test cases that are implemented in such a way that they can be re-used across many controller programs and across different test benches. This paper will provide details on the three points made above. It will show how one can implement HIL testers for commercial vehicle applications based on COTS hardware and software. It will also show how one can re-use non-real-time plant models for HIL testing.

Most of the HILs built around the world focus on specific part of a vehicle. This paper describes an in house HIL system developed for the complete hybrid car. In this HIL, the focus was to have HIL based on open hardware which is low cost and modular. It is customizable as per complex interdisciplinary vehicle requirements from Original Equipment Manufacturer that reduces dependency on suppliers and allows testing in an integrated vehicle environment. Code for operating HIL is developed in house. This HIL allows engineers to access ECU and plant model simultaneously and generate test report automatically. It consists of a vehicle plant model developed using MathWorks\u00ae Tool chain-MATLAB and Simulink. FPGA Plugin consist of software implementation of vehicle sensors in LabVIEW\u2122 software from National Instruments (NI). NI VeriStand\u2122 provides interface between LabVIEW code and plant model. Each release of vendors' software and functional safety checked in HIL, in an integrated and automated manner, before releasing to production line. This reduces bugs in field and eventually saves money and time to market. Because of early algorithm proving in vehicle development lifecycle, time and resources are saved. HIL has reduced tedious and cumbersome ECU testing on physical vehicle. Functional safety and performance related test cases have been prepared and executed to check redundant safety and fail safe functionality in ECUs, required to meet ISO 26262 standard.

The design is based on a tailless, staggered tandem wing configuration, with a carbon fiber frame and electric propulsion. The developed aircraft has a maximum weight of 12.5 kg, well within the 25 kg limit outlined by Transport Canada for permission-free operation. The UAV was designed to fly missions exceeding 24 hours, performing surveillance and oil pipeline monitoring and inspection, either autonomously or under radio control from a ground station, with medium to high payload capacity. This paper describes the process of designing, manufacturing and testing the developed configuration. The operational requirements are delineated as conceptualized by the development team. A description of the prototype development, including aerodynamics, structural and stability performance, and stability derivatives is included, based on data generated through analytical analysis, simulations in the aerodynamics and stability design software, XFLR5, and testing. The configuration was developed and modeled in the software package SolidWorks, leading to the manufacturing plans for the prototype. As this UAV performs radio controlled and autonomous flights, it makes use of the APM Arduplane, which is an open source hardware and software autopilot package. In order to achieve PID tuning, Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulations were performed between the autopilot board and two computers simultaneously running the Mission Planner software and the flight simulator X-Plane 10 software. A description of this tuning process is provided. The paper concludes with the results of performed flight tests, documenting performance achievements, and an outline of recommendations for further development.

This fundamental shift however will require a transformation and redesign of the vehicle's technical architecture. Today, a vehicle's ADAS, communications, and entertainment features exist isolated in separate devices and systems and are purpose built, leading to duplicative functions, increased costs, and difficult control, management, maintenance, and upgrade of the system. This presentation will illustrate a central control system architecture built around an IoV Gateway, an open hardware platform that integrates ICT devices for future vehicles. Not only will this gateway orchestrate the common devices and CMS as a collective unit, this open architecture will allow for scalable, flexible and easy development of 3rd party equipment, such as V2X, and new applications. New modules and\/or software applications for additional features, repairs, and upgrades can be added later without changing the existing system. This will reduce development efforts tremendously as the developer can focus on his or her subject matter expertise by adding on the features or applications onto the platform without changing the underlying system. \u00a9 2017 SAE International.","alternate_title1":"SAE Techni.

First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x 100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to 226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2) = 47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within +\/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance.","alternate_title1":"Atmos. Meas.

Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory platform that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions. \u00a9 Author(s) 2019.","alternate_title1":"Geosci.

In this paper, a low-cost, computer-Aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontalto-vertical spectral ratio (H = V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H=V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analogto-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis. \u00a9 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to \"tinkering scientists\", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the \"tinkering engineer\". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise. \u00a9 Author(s) 2020.","alternate_title1":"Geosci. Instrum.

The panoptic vision of the drone is a fundamental part of contemporary \"complex of visuality\" defined by the military-industrial complex, according to Mirzoeff. He proposes \"the right to look\" as a form of opposition to this alliance of visuality and power. The right to look from the skies as a practice of contravisuality using drones is claimed and exercised by an increasing number of hackers, artivists, social scientists, independent journalists and environmental activists, such as Mark Devries (FarmDrones) or Lot Amoros (Guerilla Drone, Flone). In order to investigate and act in the present on \"Our future drone\", we propose the creation of a citizen laboratory and a learning community in the use of UAVs as social technology.

Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17\u20130.63% (0.05\u20130.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65\u20139.38% (2.15\u20133.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes\u2019 jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population. \u00a9 2018, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

Therefore, there has been demand for the development of a device that can measure the HOB angle continuously. In this paper, we propose the rapid prototyping of an HOB measurement system using open-source hardware and software. The proposed system helps to maintain the HOB angle at a particular angle by displaying the angle and helps the medical study of pneumonia patients by enabling continuous data acquisition. Firstly, we eliminate the process of making an MCU board by utilizing an open-source hardware mbed LPC1768. Secondly, we reduce the software development time by using libraries and hence enabling the easy use of peripherals. Thirdly, for rapid prototyping, we build the enclosure of the proposed system using a 3D printer. The proposed system can be attached and detached to and from a bed. Therefore, we can attach it to the bed of a patient for whom measurement of the HOB angle is necessary. Finally, we check the measurement performance and the validity of the proposed system through an experiment utilizing an incremental encoder. \u00a9 ICROS 2015.","alternate_title1":"J. Inst.

Although availability of these platforms is undeniable, the performance of these machines in handling tasks which require execution within critical time constraints is still in question. Moreover, technical documentation and support for open hardware are scarce in comparison to expensive commercially distributed platforms. In this paper, we present a detailed process to implement embedded Linux and the real-time extension of Xenomai to two popular open embedded hardware, BeagleBone Black and i. MX6Q SABRELite. Also, we analyze the response time of real-time mechanisms and its performance for inter-task communication (ITC) between real-time tasks. Response time of real-time mechanisms is an important measure to predict the realtime performance of each platform. The performance evaluation is performed both in kernel space and user space using the metrics of jitter, to estimate the periodicity of the cyclic task, and execution time of three real-time mechanisms including semaphore, message queue, and message pipe. The results of this study would serve as a guideline in developing real-time systems on low cost open embedded hardware platforms using the real-time Linux extension of Xenomai.

We adopted the Arch Max (ARM Cortex-M4-based open-source hardware) as an HIL simulator platform. Using the nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) mechanism of the Cortex-M4 core, we assigned three interrupts with different priorities to handle three parts of the HIL simulator. The model equation of the inverted pendulum system was solved in real-time using the Runge-Kutta method in a timer interrupt service routine. An input capture interrupt-based method was used to simulate the motor drive by converting the duty ratio of pulse width modulation (PWM) signals into the voltage level applied to a DC motor. To simulate incremental rotary encoders, which are two sensors for the inverted pendulum system, a timer interrupt-based quadrature pulse generation algorithm was presented and to generate the quadrature pulse more accurately, an error compensation method was also provided. Finally, animation functionality to give a visual indication of how the controller is progressing was implemented through Vpython. Through experiments, we illustrated that the proposed HIL simulator successfully simulates the real inverted pendulum and is useful for teaching students about designing a working controller through programming embedded devices. \u00a9 ICROS 2017.","alternate_title1":"J.

In order to guarantee the robustness against the uncertainty of the actuator, we derive a model in which the robot body\u2019s acceleration is the system\u2019s control input. We then verify its validity by implementing a 2-DOF pendulum system using an omni-directional robot(ODR). The 2-DOF pendulum system can be stabilized without a mathematical model of the actuator in the proposed method. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate uncertainty in the actuator parameters. Furthermore, the method provides the advantages of flexible selection of motors used as actuators. First, we design a mechanical part to measure the angular velocity of the motor and to measure the inclination of an inverted pendulum. Second, we derive a mathematical model of a 2-DOF pendulum system for acceleration which the control input. The controller adopts the Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) to obtain the acceleration required for stabilization. The determined acceleration is converted to the velocity references of wheels through integration and transformation. The velocity references are followed through PI-velocity controllers. Third, the control system is implemented using the open source hardware Nucleo-32 F303K8 board. We illustrate the proposed control system\u2019s effectiveness through stabilization experiments.

We use the Arduino Due as opensource hardware. The proposed high speed monitoring system has four features. First, it does not affect the operation of the user application running on a micro-controller. The proposed system performs realtime monitoring using an algorithm that minimizes the computational load. Second, data channels can have different data types and update periods. Consequently, flexible data monitoring is possible. Third, the proposed system uses MATLAB\/Simulink for monitoring. As a result, users can utilize all the powerful functions supported by MATLAB to process the monitored data. Finally, the algorithm of the proposed high speed monitoring system can be applied to any micro-controller with serial communication peripheral. Through experiments, we verify the performance of the developed monitoring system. It is shown that the data loss does not happen through the basic experiment. Through realtime monitoring experiment for the sensorless drive system of the BLDC motor, it is illustrated that the proposed system has its strength in high speed monitoring of data changing very fast such as current or back EMF signals. \u00a9 ICROS 2019.","alternate_title1":"J.

Among them, crevasses, which are deep cracks in glaciers, can cause fatal accidents since they are difficult to locate as they are covered with snow. In this paper, we present the development, design, and deployment of an UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) that can explore ice-sheets and be used in various polar research fields. The developed UGV was customized to remotely detect crevasses and prevent related accidents. In order to adapt to the harsh terrain of Antarctica, the vehicle features ground clearance over 260 mm, four-wheel-drive ability with a 400W high-power motor, as well as passive joints and differential links to allow for four-point contact on rough terrain. The UGV is also designed to run for more than two hours on the Antarctic ice sheet at a speed of 2.5 m\/sec. The control unit uses open-source hardware and software for rapid function implementation and ease of future customization. In November 2019, the UGV detected crevasses successfully by towing an IPR (Ice Penetrating Radar) along the 2.6 km section of the Browning Pass around Jang Bogo Station, Antarctica. Further improvement is required for heading angle errors due to magnetic compass malfunctions in Antarctica, and for the vibration and misalignment of the traction device for the towing research equipment. \u00a9 ICROS 2021.","alternate_title1":"J.

These devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data considering a 99% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error of 20.8 W\/m2. An analysis of its response time also estimated from a dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment. The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US $ 60.00 is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices. \u00a9 2018 International Journal of Thermodynamics.

In particular, 3D printing technology is expanding into the realms of classical science, technology and our daily lives. Relatedly, in the present study, we demonstrate the manufacture of a nano-LC MALDI spotter robot using 3D printing technology. The parts of the spotter robot were either made using a 3D printer or purchased as 3D printer parts from the 3D printer online market, so that anyone can make the robot without a deep knowledge of engineering or electronics, i.e., DIY (do-it-yourself) product. In the nano-LC MALDI spotter, the nano-LC eluent and MALDI matrix were mixed in a T-union and discharged from the capillary outlet.

The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1. \u00a9 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

In order to educate new generations of software and IT engineers to be able to develop such microservice-based applications, educators at universities should establish an efficient platform to ensure this process.

The platform is focused on supporting lightweight publish\/subscribe messaging protocols, such as MQTT, and built-on open-source hardware development boards such as Arduino\/Genuino. This Smart City learning platform is designed to enable the collaborative development of systems, applications and services for the cities of the future, and it should be efficient enough to support the learning of all the necessary skills that can be used for the development of complex and large-scale systems.

This research addresses the design and construction of a tool that favors the process of visual and auditory stimulation in patients with neurological disorders, as part of a joint project between the University of Las Tunas, Holguin and the Center for Research and Rehabilitation of Hereditary Ataxy (CIRAH). In this institution there is a testing device capable of visual and auditory stimulation, but it is in very poor technical condition, it is not portable and it is the only one in the region. To achieve compliance with the target we used open hardware platform Arduino connected to different sensors. These sensors measure the potential generated by the patient's response projected on a TV where the stimulus sent from the platform is displayed. It was determined that the sampling frequency of the analog signal is 1 KHz to ensure reliability of measurements and serial communication protocol is developed, that allows to configure the visual and auditory stimulator. In addition, a graphical user interface that communicates with the protocol created and facilitates test setup was implemented. Finally, an extensible tool to the rest of the country's health institutions at a reduced cost was obtained.","alternate_title1":"Rev cuba cienc informat","authors":["P\u00e9rez Guzm\u00e1n, Ricardo Enrique","C\u00e9spedes P\u00e9rez, Ariel","Garc\u00eda Berm\u00fadez, Rodolfo Valent\u00edn","P\u00e9rez C\u00e9spedes, Arianna"],"database_provider":"http:\/\/www.scielo.org\/","date":"2017-09","doi":null,"end_page":"91","file_attachments1":"http:\/\/scielo.sld.cu\/pdf\/rcci\/v11n3\/rcci07317.pdf","id":"S2227-18992017000300007-cub","issn":"2227-1899","journal_name":"Revista Cubana de Ciencias Inform\u00e1ticas","keywords":["eye movement","visual and auditory stimuli","Arduino","movimientos oculares","estimulaci\u00f3n visual y auditiva","Arduino"],"language":"es","name_of_database":"SciELO Cuba","number":"3","start_page":"77","title":"Estimulador visual y auditivo para pruebas cl\u00ednicas de electrooculograf\u00eda basado en la plataforma Arduino","translated_title":"Visual and auditory stimulator to clinical electrooculographic tests based on Arduino platform","type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"http:\/\/scielo.sld.cu\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2227-18992017000300007&lang=en","volume":"11","year":"2017","author_address":null,"custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":null,"place_published":null,"publisher":null,"secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":null,"short_title":null,"type_of_work":null,"accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":624,"__source":["scielo.ris"],"abstract":"AbstractOne possible solution to small-scale automation problems, is use the rapid prototyping platform called Arduino, this paper shows the current status of the device and its use in industrial control tasks.

This process requires the implementation of strategies for real-time filtering for the time of occurrence of each R wave. Various mathematical techniques have been implemented for the detection of the R wave and these require digital systems with high performance computing. At present, there are opportunities to implement filtering strategies in low-cost devices in real time. The principal goal of this paper is to present the results obtained by implementing a real-time digital filter for the detection of the R wave of the ECG signal. The implemented strategy is based on the averaging and derived filters theory, which have been implemented on an ARM programmable device and open hardware. The filtering system provides a binary signal indicating the occurrence of the R wave and is input to a system for quantifying the instantaneous heart rate.

It examines the Ground Truth project, which addresses the Palestinian-Bedouin struggle for indigenous rights in the Naqab desert, in the southern region of Israel\/Palestine. It focuses on the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial photography with balloons and kites, alongside other collaborative practices, for mapping and visualizing Bedouin political and spatial claims. Against a backdrop of increasingly technologically savvy legal-professional cultures in human-rights organizations, this article proposes that a community-based DIY approach to truth making may challenge entrenched thresholds of participation and open opportunities for creating hybrid forums in the human-rights field. Finally, it suggests that civic technoscience can offer an experimental ground for training oneself in critical ways of thinking and engaging with technology.

First, we will look at the open source hardware development as a methodology that fulfills demands for mass customization. In the open source hardware development, project owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources. Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs. Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers' participation is one of the key factors in successful project management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation. \u00a9 2018 International Journal of Industrial Engineering.","alternate_title1":"Int J Ind Eng Theory Appl Pract","authors":["Kim, J.","Hong, Y.S."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":null,"end_page":"662","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"10724761 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Developer participation","Google project Ara","Mass customization","Open source hardware","Platform evaluation","Computer aided manufacturing","Project management","Developer participations","Google project Ara","Mass customization","Open-source hardwares","Platform evaluation","Open systems"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":null,"start_page":"647","title":"Platform planning framework for open source hardware development with case study of project ara","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060689787&partnerID=40&md5=d656d33f9c6edd5593eaacb6ee2b5235","volume":"25","year":"2018","author_address":"Department of Industrial Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: IJIEF","Correspondence Address: Hong, Y.S.; Department of Industrial Engineering, South Korea; email: yhong@snu.ac.kr"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"UNIV CINCINNATI INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"International Journal of Industrial Engineering : Theory Applications and Practice","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":"WOS:000456069800008","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Kim, Jiyun Hong, Yoo S.","author_keywords":"open source hardware; mass customization; platform evaluation; developer participation; Google project Ara","beginning_page":"648","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"17","conference_date":"2016","conference_host":null,"conference_location":"Seoul, SOUTH KOREA","conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":"18th International Conference on Industrial Engineering (IUIE)","date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"HH9PB","document_type":"Article; Proceedings Paper","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"1943-670X","email_address":"yhong@snu.ac.kr","ending_page":"662","funding_agency_and_grant_number":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2017R1E1A1A03070846]","funding_text":"This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. NRF-2017R1E1A1A03070846).","group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Int.

This paper presents two OSHWs developed for the diagnosis of heritage metal artefacts. The DiscoveryMat application allows the qualitative analysis of slightly oxidised metals such as copper and aluminium-based alloys, through the standardized monitoring of the variation of their corrosion potential (Ecorr) with time. The Pleco allows the local identification of corrosion products through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots and this contributes to a better adjustment of conservation treatments on metal artefacts covered with heterogeneous corrosion layers through the selective intervention on some corrosion products and the preservation of others. If the Pleco can already be found in the toolbox of some conservation professionals, the DiscoveryMat application is still in its infancy and needs to be developed in the future as a participatory tool. \u00a9 2018, Research Trend.

In a pilot project, such devices were introduced to university students learning to become elementary school science teachers. The potential for such devices to replace currently used commercial DAQs was examined, as well as the attitude of the students to this equipment. Focus was on the Arduino-based platform, which can operate in two different modes as a standalone data-logger device or as a DAQ connected to a computer with full data visualisation.

The buoy also has a real-time clock and an SD memory card to save data and the time of the measurements. Volunteers tested KdUINOs in Canada and Antarctica. They did some preliminary tests with KdUINOs where they compared light diffuse attenuation coefficient between Ramsey Lake and Lake Laurentian. Ramsey Lake has depths up to 100 m, a diverse population of fish and normal pH for the boreal region of Canada. KdUINO was deployed through fall freeze and left in place until spring melt through winter 2015, with atmospheric temperatures down to -20\u00b0 C during the winter, and it worked properly under these freezing weather conditions. The preliminary tests concluded that Ramsey Lake was found to have a Kd about six times lower than Lake Laurentian, indicating, as expected, that Ramsey Lake is much more transparent than Lake Laurentian. In Antarctica, taking advantage of the annual research campaigns of the Hesperides vessel, a volunteer, who was a technician of the ship, made measurements using the KdUINO at 60\u00b0 S and 61\u00b0 S. The temperature of the water\/air of the sampling points was 1.5\u00b0 C and -2\u00b0 C. light diffuse attenuation coefficient values obtained are within the expected values in this region.","alternate_title1":"Sea Technol.","authors":["Bardaji, R.","Best, M.","Piera, J."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":null,"end_page":"39","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"00933651 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["air temperature","data acquisition","data buoy","hardware","latitude","light attenuation","sensor","ship motion","vessel","Antarctica","Canada","Michigan","Ramsey Lake","United States"],"language":"English","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"2","start_page":"37","title":"Citizen science in high-latitude ecosystems: Kduino buoy to support data gathering in extreme environments","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026670576&partnerID=40&md5=a5d7bb25ebbc6157c1899a4c64a29104","volume":"58","year":"2017","author_address":"McGill University, Canada","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Export Date: 18 February 2021"],"place_published":null,"publisher":"Compass Publications Inc.","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Sea Technology","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":648,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"Due to proliferation in the metropolitan areas there existing problem of poor traffic congestion has grown at alarming event and it is not easy to find the stolen vehicles.

In particular, it can support IP-based wireless connectivity and social networking through the Telegram Bot communicate with the elderly and their authorized persons such as family, a nurse, or a social worker. The user will receive the information from the proposed system, such as on\/off states of the power strip, a type of devices connected to the power strip, and current measurement values from them, through a Telegram application on a smartphone. After checking the on\/off states, the type of devices, and current measurement values, the user can decide which relays need to be controlled and send text messages with the indices of the specific relays and corresponding commands to the proposed system. Furthermore, to receive any alert messages for power saving and accident prevention, we can change the reference values for the sensors.

The OS4BME project aims at developing a new generation of biomedical engineers, able to exploit emerging technologies generated by the recent \"Makers\" revolution. During the one week summer school, students from various sub-Saharan countries were introduced to these new design, development and sharing paradigms. Students worked together to identify new simple biomedical devices, which could help in daily clinical practice in their countries. A cheap and easy-to-use neonatal monitoring device was chosen as a Crowd design project. The OS4BME Baby Monitor was designed and assembled by the students during the one week summer school, demonstrating the creative potential of the new generation of biomedical engineers empowered with the paradigms of crowdsourcing and rapid prototyping. \u00a9 2015 by authors.","alternate_title1":"Int.

The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safety-critical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safety- critical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real time oper ating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safety- critical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for in- dustrial machinery. \u00a9 J.UCS.","alternate_title1":"J. Univers. Comput.

This article charts the device-level technologies used in the creation the IoT, including hardware, software and communications. IoT's emergence coincided with the development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology offering advantages such as the communicable range, ability to write data to a tag, and the possibility of reading multiple tags more efficiently with a single reader. RFID is now just one of many component IoT technologies. We have arrived at a situation where it is practically trivial to integrate computation and communication into any manufactured thing, and it is equally feasible to connect and technologically perceive natural things using communicable sensors. Furthermore, it is possible to react to, and control the environment using embedded computing devices coupled with actuators. Thorough comprehension of functional and non-functional requirements is necessary to develop an effective, efficient design specification for an IoT device. But given the large design space and complexity, there are numerous barriers to entry. As a result, many types of device have been adopted as practical de facto hardware development platforms across research communities, anc hacker and maker communities. In each case, intermediary 'operating systems', designed to simplify their programming by masking hardware complexity, are typically used. Their technical specifications are often not fully disclosed, but they do rely on well- defined standards to ensure the necessary interoperability. The majority of devices are characterised as single board computers. The final design for a market-ready product will likely be as efficient and cost-effective as possible in terms of design, but include sufficient redundancy to support software updates and potential shifts in standards. Since the early 2000s, the wireless sensor network community has worked with highly constrained devices characterised by limited energy, storage, communications, packet loss, etc. Incremental improvement! to hardware components have led to net energy efficiency improvements, increased computation for equivalent or less energy, more storage, etc. Algorithms and protocol! have been developed to further improve efficiency and reliability. The 'maker' movements have focused on open source hardware whereas those on the educationa side have sought to reduce the barriers to entry in terms of cost and simplification, e.g. the Raspberry Pi. Industrialists have increasingly tended to incorporate monitoring systems into their operations. Cellular connectivity has also been adopted and both are now converging on IoT. Although wireless connectivity has been central to the development of many IoT standards, devices with wired connections can also be part of the IoT. Indeed, many standards relevant to IoT are designed independent of the particular physical communications medium enabling seamless interoperability at higher layers and easing connectivity concerns in integrated applications. A number of approaches exist to developing software for IoT devices. As the computing power available increases, the ease with which one may programme the device tends to improve. The fewer resources that are available, the closer the software developer must get to the hardware. To reduce the complexity of programming devices, operating systems and associated programming languages have been designed or adapted to suit the embedded environment. Considering the more computationally powerful single board computers, certain flavours of Linux have been developed. High-end boards with significant processing capabilities are capable of running full-blown operating systems. Recently, mobile operating systems, such as Android, have been used, and stripped down versions have been touted by the big developers. From a devices perspective, it is easier than ever to connect a sensor, a controller, or a mundane household item to the Internet. On the other hand, there are still significant challenges to be overcome. With regard to industrial applications with strict performance requirements, multiple constraints, and often-difficult operational environments, work is far from complete.","alternate_title1":"J.

Historically, good platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes. Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing laboratory procedures for students to study controls. The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-touse hardware and software. The \"motor shield\" is an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller design. The Arduino board is powered by, and communicates with Simulink, through a standard USB connection.","alternate_title1":"Comput. Educ.

Rapid advances in electronic technologies have made a variety of inexpensive sensing, monitoring, and control capabilities available. A monitoring system was developed and evaluated for automatic measurement of liquid levels, and demonstrated by monitoring water levels in evaporation pans used in evaporation studies and irrigation scheduling. The system is composed of an ultrasonic sensor, a microcontroller-based data logger, and a temperature sensor. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the sensor to the liquid surface. Air temperature is measured by the temperature sensor, and is used to compensate for changes in the speed of sound due to air-temperature variations to improve accuracy of ultrasonic distance measurements. The datalogger is programmed to take measurements and to store data on a memory card which can be downloaded for processing and analysis. All components of the system were assembled in a PVC housing. The system was tested in the field, and resulted in water levels measured by the system corresponding very closely to those measured manually (R2 &gt; 0.98). This system is inexpensive, with total cost of US$85, and easy to build, install, and maintain. In addition to monitoring liquid levels, the system could be adapted to a variety of other measurements.","alternate_title1":"Agric. Eng. Int.

The conceptualization comprises all stages in the design process, ranging from need-finding to the openness of the design documents and the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for open design. The article builds on an extensive literature review about studies on 'open' in design: open-source software, open hardware, and participatory methods in design, such as co-design and participatory design, and user-engagement methods such as crowdsourcing and co-creation.","alternate_title1":"Proc.

The pipeline architecture was consisted of a NC pipeline thread, a driver and a NC Microcode Processor (NCMP). The NC Canonical Command (NCCC) interface and the NC Microcode (NCM) interface were defined to ensure the inter-changeability of different modules and the reconfiguration of the pipeline. The primary control functions from code interpretation to NCM generation were encapsulated in the NC pipeline thread. Standard programming interface and software development techniques were employed to guarantee the portability of the NC pipeline thread. The NCMP utilized reconfigurable open hardware to execute the NCM and perform the real-time control functions. The non-real-time section and real-time section of the NC pipeline was isolated by the NCM buffer. The experiment showed that the NC pipeline architecture was applicable to a wide range of general hardware and software platforms, and it provided a practical approach to construct open architecture CNC systems.","alternate_title1":"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong","authors":["Dong, J.-C.","Wang, T.-Y.","Xu, Y."],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":null,"end_page":"1139","file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"10065911 (ISSN)","journal_name":null,"keywords":["Computer numerical control","Numerical control microcode","Numerical control pipeline","Open architecture","Reconfigurable","Computer numerical control","Numerical control microcode","Numerical control pipeline","Open architecture","Reconfigurable","Architecture","Computer architecture","Computer control systems","Computer hardware","Computer software portability","Numerical control systems","Pipeline codes","Pipelines","Program interpreters","Real time control","Semiconductor storage","Software architecture","Standardization","Computer control"],"language":"Chinese","name_of_database":"Scopus","number":"6","start_page":"1130","title":"Open architecture CNC based on NC pipeline technology","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":"JOUR","url":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/inward\/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650069494&partnerID=40&md5=ed70c729c04615d28dcb5a16b76dbb84","volume":"15","year":"2009","author_address":"Tianjin Key Lab. of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies and Equipments, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":["Cited By :7","Export Date: 18 February 2021","CODEN: JJZXF","Correspondence Address: Dong, J.-C.; Tianjin Key Lab. of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies and Equipments, , Tianjin 300072, China; email: new_lightning@sohu.com"],"place_published":null,"publisher":null,"secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong\/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS","short_title":null,"type_of_work":"Article","accession_number":null,"article_number":null,"author_full_name":null,"author_keywords":null,"beginning_page":null,"book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":null,"conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":null,"document_delivery_number":null,"document_type":null,"early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":null,"ending_page":null,"funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":null,"issue":null,"keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":null,"page_count":null,"part_number":null,"publication_date":null,"publication_name":null,"publication_type":null,"publisher_address":null,"publisher_city":null,"pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":null,"research_areas":null,"researcher_id":null,"source_abbreviation_29c":null,"special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":null,"usage_count_180":null,"usage_count_2013":null,"wos_categories":null,"wos_core_collection_cited_count":null},{"index":674,"__source":["scopus.ris"],"abstract":"IP-PBXs work with VoIP telephones to connect a number of private extensions through lines to the public phone system, routing outbound, and incoming calls and providing features such as voice services on an IP based data network and teleconferencing. IP-PBXs can also mix IP and traditional telephony, as in trunking a call from an analog phone over the Internet and routing an incoming analog call from the PSTN to a VoIP telephone. An extremely low cost yet powerful IP-PBX reference design can be developed and put into production by the combination of the Analog Devices Blackfin, which is an open hardware, to Asterisk, Oslec, and uClinux. The IP04 is such an open hardware IP-PBX design that uses a four port IP-PBX running Asterisk and uClinux on a Blackfin processor. The Blackfin boot ROM starts reading from the 256-kbit SPI flash chip, when power is applied. IP04 requires a lot of flash storage to store the Asterisk executable and audio prompts in comparison to embedded Linux systems.","alternate_title1":"Electron. Eng.

To design such appliances, a hardware\/software co-design methodology, which allows concurrent hardware and software development before a system prototype is available, is the preferred solution. While different hardware and software specification techniques present obstacles that each combined approach has to overcome, the introduction of SystemC, a C++ class library for hardware and system level specification, has opened a new horizon. This paper combines open source components, to built a custom and flexible co-simulation environment based on SystemC. Even though commercial solutions for this problem have recently been introduced, their high cost and small to medium scale customization capability, make this open source and fully customizable competitor look appealing, especially for researchers and small companies.","alternate_title1":"Comp.

Today, developments in NdFeb magnets have caused these magnets to become essential elements in many technology fields. NdFeB magnets are widely used in the engines of hybrid electric vehicles due to the maximum energy product (BHmax). In addition, usage of NdFeB in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, electric motors, various generators and in large-scale or small-scale wind energy generators have increased significantly. In this study, before the production of NdFeB magnets, a virtual laboratory platform which can be used in research and development studies and production is realized.The developed virtual platform is designed and run as a desktop application. In future studies, web based applications will be developed by using open source hardware.In the study, mathematical functions were obtained from data related to B-r(permanent magnetism), H-c(magnetic coercivity), BHmax, and Curie temperature obtained in researches on different NdFeB alloys in real laboratory.The virtual laboratory platform was prepared with the obtained functions. The laboratory system can be used in industry for multi-purpose. In addition, it also allows for use for educational purposes. It is aimed to save cost and time during the the research and development studies in magnet design and to perform different magnet works.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Cakir, MF","Karhan, M"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":null,"end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"1302-0900","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"Turkish","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"Virtual Platform Model for Production of NdFeB Magnets","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"23","year":"2020","author_address":"[Cakir, Musa Faruk; Karhan, Mustafa] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Elekt & Otomasyon Bolumu, Cankiri, Turkey.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":null,"place_published":null,"publisher":"GAZI UNIV","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":null,"short_title":null,"type_of_work":null,"accession_number":"WOS:000545278700019","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Cakir, Musa Faruk Karhan, Mustafa","author_keywords":"NdFeB; BHmax (maximum energy product); Br (permanent magnetism); Hc (magnetic coercivity); virtual platform","beginning_page":"763","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"29","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"MF3XE","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":"2147-9429","email_address":"mustafakarhan@gmail.com","ending_page":"770","funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"J.

In developed countries, these systems are being replaced by mechatronic systems applied in variable dosing machines. Mechatronic systems have the advantage that their performance is not affected by the conditions of the soil and vegetation cover, in addition to the ease of making changes in the dose of input supplies, by allowing them to be carried out continuously and in real time. However, they have the disadvantage of their high acquisition cost. This study presents the laboratory test results of a mechatronic system developed with low-cost free hardware and software, and adapted to the Model LC-U-N seeder-fertilizer from the manufacturer Sembradoras del Bajio S. A de C. V. The seed dispenser was tested to the standard of the corn seed greased belt described in ISO 7256-1:1984. The results show good seed distribution quality at rotation frequencies of the seed disk of 0.524 to 2,199 rad s(-1), obtaining feeding quality indexes a 90%, seed loss and multiplicity less than 6 % and precision <18 %. The fertilizer and pesticide dispensers were tested based on the mexican standard NMX-0-222-SCFI-2004, with commercial UREA fertilizer, using five rotation frequencies in the range of 0.524 to 3.77 rad s(-1) and 1047 to 14,661 rad s(-1), respectively, with different openings of the outlet gate. In the case of the fertilizer dispenser, an application dose of 3 to 562 kg ha(-1) was obtained with the best performance when using gate openings 50 %, while the pesticide dispenser presented excellent performance, with which it was obtained an application rate of 0.004 to 16.4 kg ha(-1).","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Torres-Sandoval, J","Romantchik-Kriuchkova, E","Lopez-Cruz, IL","Lopez-Cantens, GD","de la O-Olan, M"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":null,"end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"0187-7380","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"Spanish","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"TESTS OF A SEEDER AND FERTILIZER MACHINE WITH A MECHATRONIC SYSTEM ADAPTED TO CONTROL THE DISPENSERS","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"43","year":"2020","author_address":"[Torres-Sandoval, Julio; de la O-Olan, Micaela] Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Campo Expt Valle Mexico, Texcoco, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.

In order to obtain viability of design and prototype implementation, the construction of two systems was proposed based on DigiMesh and Wi-Fi; those prototypes could be applied to different scenarios such as urban and rural areas. Additionally, it was performed an evaluation of broadcasting of information to platforms of Internet of Things (IoT), where the data collected by the nodes will be managed and displayed. This system was conceived as a low-cost alternative compared with conventional weather stations that offer these facilities and are based on free hardware and software components.

The development of systems for continuous monitoring are important to aquaculture crops since these can detect unwanted conditions that can be harmful for organisms. In this study, are valued open hardware and artificial intelligence as alternative platforms to develop new monitoring systems. The proposed system automatically records the physicochemical variables of the water (dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH) and processes them using fuzzy logic (artificial intelligence) for the determination of the water quality index. The system was tested in a shrimp culture (Litopenaeus vannamei) with a size of 1.67 +\/- 0.23g in a period of 84 days. The results show that the system analyzes the physicochemical variables most important of a shrimp culture and were able to qualify as a water quality index: poor, good and excellent according to the optimal thresholds required by the crop.

Some authors have described the innovation process as Engineering Innovation. Currently the software is no longer a technology support, hidden and invisible, to become the driver of value-creating process. Consequently, the challenge of software engineering and engineering innovation should be integrated and complement in order creates new ways to create value. To encourage innovation, in addition to understanding tools and practices of the innovation process, the innovation skills are required. These skills can be grouped into: technical, creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and management. This paper proposes a strategy based on the use of open source hardware and software to address the development of skills to innovate. The strategy is presented by narrating academic experiences. The aim of these experiments is the conception of new technological products.","alternate_title1":null,"authors":["Oviedo, SE","Diaz, D","Otazu, AM","Ibanez, F"],"database_provider":null,"date":null,"doi":null,"end_page":null,"file_attachments1":null,"id":null,"issn":"2255-1514","journal_name":null,"keywords":null,"language":"Spanish","name_of_database":null,"number":null,"start_page":null,"title":"A Strategic for Development of Technologic Innovation Skill","translated_title":null,"type_of_reference":null,"url":null,"volume":"4","year":"2015","author_address":"[Elizabeth Oviedo, Sandra; Diaz, Daniel; Maria Otazu, Alejandra; Ibanez, Francisco] Univ Nacl San Juan, Dept Informat, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","custom2":null,"custom3":null,"custom7":null,"notes":null,"place_published":null,"publisher":"RED UNIV CAMPUS VIRTUALES","secondary_authors":null,"secondary_title":null,"short_title":null,"type_of_work":null,"accession_number":"WOS:000368165800008","article_number":null,"author_full_name":"Elizabeth Oviedo, Sandra Diaz, Daniel Maria Otazu, Alejandra Ibanez, Francisco","author_keywords":"Software and innovation; Innovation engineering; Innovation skill; Open hardware and software; Creativity; Collaborative work; Arduino","beginning_page":"74","book_authors":null,"book_authors_full_name":null,"book_doi":null,"book_group_authors":null,"book_series_title":null,"cited_reference_count":"13","conference_date":null,"conference_host":null,"conference_location":null,"conference_sponsors":null,"conference_title":null,"date_generated":"2021-02-18","document_delivery_number":"DA9YN","document_type":"Article","early_access_date":null,"editors":null,"eissn":null,"email_address":"yddiaz@gmail.com","ending_page":"82","funding_agency_and_grant_number":null,"funding_text":null,"group_authors":null,"isbn":null,"iso_source_abbreviation":"Campus Virtuales","issue":"1","keywords_plus":null,"meeting_abstract":null,"open_access_indicator":null,"orcid_id":"de Mendoza, Francisco Ruiz\/0000-0002-1200-2850","page_count":"9","part_number":null,"publication_date":"MAR","publication_name":"CAMPUS VIRTUALES","publication_type":"J","publisher_address":"AVENIDA DE MARZO, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN","publisher_city":"HUELVA","pubmed_id":null,"reprint_address":"Oviedo, SE (corresponding author), Univ Nacl San Juan, Dept Informat, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","research_areas":"Education & Educational Research","researcher_id":"de Mendoza, Francisco Ruiz\/ABG-4159-2020","source_abbreviation_29c":"CAMPUS VIRTUALES","special_issue":null,"supplement":null,"total_times_cited_count":"0","usage_count_180":"0","usage_count_2013":"8","wos_categories":"Education & Educational Research","wos_core_collection_cited_count":"0"},{"index":703,"__source":["wos501-973.ciw"],"abstract":"One possible solution to small-scale automation problems, is use the rapid prototyping platform called Arduino, this paper shows the current status of the device and its use in industrial control tasks.
