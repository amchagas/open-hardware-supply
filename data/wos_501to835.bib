Abstract = {{Open Hardware and Free Software have both active communities. Open
   source software projects have helped many companies launch their
   products, but that has not happened in the same proportion for hardware.
   Assistive technology industry is known to be extremely restricted to
   proprietary solutions, which may lead to slower development cycles as
   there is a smaller community of device developers. This paper details
   how an Arduino-based open hardware project can be improved to become an
   industrial product with the same quality level of existing available
   devices. The resulting product is scheduled to be released to the public
   this year and will expand the use of power wheelchairs in Brazil so that
   people with disabilities have access to such electronic equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic development of information and communication technologies
   nowadays lead to arising the new solutions in monitoring and sensing
   applications. The most significant solution in that area are Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSN). These networks consist of a large number of small
   devices, each with different kinds of sensors. Sensor network nodes are
   arranged near or inside the potentially dangerous environment, which may
   cause the damage of the node. However, due to the small size and low
   cost nodes, these networks have a very broad application. The use of the
   WSN is dependent on the type of application used. Typical applications
   for this type of network can be: environmental monitoring, detection and
   tracking of people and vehicles, to detect various types of threats,
   machine monitoring or even health monitoring.
   The ability of the design and implement of the Wireless Sensor Networks
   is very important for today's engineers. The subject of the paper is
   issue related to the way of teaching Wireless Sensor Networks with the
   use of Arduino open source development board. The review of the learning
   path, which starts from the design and finishes on the implementation,
   was made. The advantages of the use of the open source hardware platform
   as also as open source software were determined. The way of design of
   Wireless Sensor Network using XBee protocol was explained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an open source hardware and software platform

   to prepare new laboratory demonstrations and projects for kinematics and

   consists of a computing portable station with static sensors and a
   microcontroller based mobile device small sensors embedded. The whole
   platform rely heavily on wireless technologies so the students could
   operate the platform with their own tablets or smartphones.
   To meet the open source requirements, all the components comply with
   open source restrictions and also the design documents and the source
   code are made publicly available to the education community. Therefore,
   there is not only an economical sensing alternative to current
   configurations of laboratories but an extensible system in which new
   requirements and sensors could be added covering new areas such as
   electronics, magnetism and thermodynamics. A user friendly web client
   permits the students to configure and perform measurements using an

Abstract = {{Robot development could benefit from reuse of hardware and software
   components. One of the most successful example is the Robot Operating
   System (ROS), which aims at supporting robot development and research in
   robotics by providing a modular and general purpose software framework;
   yet, at a lower level, i.e., mechanics, electronics, and firmware,
   component-based robotics is still in its early stages. Moreover, basic
   functionalities, such as robust odometry and pose tracking, seem to be
   solved on an ad-hoc basis, while no generic solution can be plugged in a
   system as an off-the-shelf component. This paper presents two modular
   tools for the development of robotics applications and how these can be
   deployed on different robot platforms as off-the-shelf, open hardware
   and open software, components at the hardware, firmware, and core
   software levels. A case study based on two mobile platforms is described
   showing how it is possible to reuse physical components in the building
   of a mobile robot and provide an off-the-shelf architecture which sports
   multi-sensor fusion for robust odometry and pose tracking, requiring a
   fraction of the effort with respect to ad hoc techniques.}},

   yaw of the waist, and 2 DOFs for head pan and tilt. Our main innovation
   is in the employment of a polyurethane based compliant spring system
   attached to conventional robotics servo motors, turning them into
   low-cost series elastic actuators (SEAs). To demonstrate the robot's
   capabilities in the context of cognitive robotics research and
   goal-directed behavior, we successfully employed a multiple timescale

Abstract = {{Selective openness allows a firm to sell a systemic innovation that
   combines both open and proprietary technologies. Such firm strategies
   are now common for open source software and other information goods.
   However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for
   hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware
   has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm
   openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries
   leveraged external communities and selective openness become the
   consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic
   innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary
   strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of
   the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware,
   software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and
   grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted
   to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented
   proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from
   its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent
   complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and

Abstract = {{This study provides an in-depth investigation into low-cost and no-cost
   substrate release mechanisms that allow gas metal arc weld 3-D printed
   ER4043 aluminum and ER70S-6 steel parts to be removed from a reusable
   print substrate with minimal energy. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and
   titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release
   agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of
   substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested
   for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a
   modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an
   1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the
   impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior
   to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were
   measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the
   parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed
   substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some
   instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed
   the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results
   thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from
   print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to
   distributed manufacturing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To provide process optimization of metal fabricating self-replicating
   rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and
   data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) of the gas
   metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source
   hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V
   where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the
   Arduino that is used to control the 3-D printer itself. Franklin
   firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the
   printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored
   readings to the user's computer. To test this custom current and voltage
   monitoring device this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal
   RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER1100, ER4043, ER4943,
   ER4047, and ER5356). The voltage and current data were analyzed on a per
   alloy basis and also layer-by-layer in order to evaluate the device's
   efficacy as a monitoring device for 3-D printing and the results of the
   integrated design are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a robotic platform based on the open source RepRap 3D printer
   that can print and maintain chemical artificial life in the form of a
   dynamic, chemical droplet. The robot uses computer vision, a
   self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize
   the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this
   categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet
   and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and
   either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce
   a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g.,
   division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and
   feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of
   nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and
   error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical
   confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches
   to artificial life.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological
   variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for
   both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies
   is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee
   population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based
   on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added
   temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular
   conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record
   changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees'
   thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with
   opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for
   controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives
   with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee
   colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa
   bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board
   hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus
   indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of
   open-screened bottom board models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The article describes the design phase, development and practical

   running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the
   system performance such as proper operation, and the control and

   energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to
   monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at
   moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and
   customizable device, even in terms of installation in different
   environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were
   used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol

Abstract = {{Phenotyping has become the rate-limiting step in using large-scale
   genomic data to understand and improve agricultural crops. Here, the
   Bellwether Phenotyping Platform for controlled-environment plant growth
   and automated multimodal phenotyping is described. The system has
   capacity for 1140 plants, which pass daily through stations to record
   fluorescence, near-infrared, and visible images. Plant Computer Vision
   (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent
   software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild
   Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally
   different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines
   produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions,
   Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water
   replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient
   growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV
   software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on
   height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and
   tissue water status traits. All similar to 79 000 images acquired during
   the course of the experiment are publicly available.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a completely randomizable flow-through outdoor mesocosm for
   climate change and ecotoxicology studies that was built with inexpensive
   materials. The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 6x water renewal per hour,
   avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an
   open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters
   and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH
   up to -0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6 degrees C in three
   treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with
   the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the
   diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an
   integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We
   validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system
   by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community
   extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a
   40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification,
   and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and
   consistent treatment manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the additive manufacturing of complex three-dimensional
   (3D) biological structures using soft protein and polysaccharide
   hydrogels that are challenging or impossible to create using traditional
   fabrication approaches. These structures are built by embedding the
   printed hydrogel within a secondary hydrogel that serves as a temporary,
   thermoreversible, and biocompatible support. This process, termed
   freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels, enables 3D
   printing of hydrated materials with an elastic modulus <500 kPa
   including alginate, collagen, and fibrin. Computer-aided design models
   of 3D optical, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging data
   were 3D printed at a resolution of similar to 200 mm and at low cost by
   leveraging open-source hardware and software tools. Proof-of-concept
   structures based on femurs, branched coronary arteries, trabeculated
   embryonic hearts, and human brains were mechanically robust and
   recreated complex 3D internal and external anatomical architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Today, open source software plays a significant role in information
   technology and consumer electronics. Open source hardware, which is the
   free exchange of a product's design information, is gaining popularity
   as well. Both ideologies are motivated by trading away competition

   open source movement to space technology. In the focus of our discussion
   are CubeSats, considered as an ideal playground for the introduction of
   technological and methodological novelties. We examine the legal
   background of open source designs and contrast the advantages of open
   source products for developers and users against closed source products.
   We then present an open source initiative for CubeSat technologies with
   the intention to encourage the CubeSat community to move towards open

Abstract = {{Precision agriculture combines the use of information and technology to
   ensure the best agricultural practices. Obtaining real-time non-invasive
   information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge.
   An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time
   data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is
   possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and
   open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The
   system presented has two main components: a device that records
   environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that
   links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the
   information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors
   used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the
   rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various
   scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover,
   this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is
   an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to
   other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and
   management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices
   to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of
   technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of
   calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this
   system in precision agriculture are presented. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published

Abstract = {{An embedded model predictive controller (eMPC) based on the linear MPC
   module in Statoil Estimation and Prediction Tool for Identification and
   Control has been developed, and it is intended to facilitate the MPC
   application on embedded hardware. The control design approach
   illustrates a viable way of migrating from an industrial PC-based MPC
   technology to an embedded platform. This work also provides the
   transformations and the real-time considerations necessary to achieve a
   functional high-performance predictive controller on a low-cost embedded
   hardware, with limited computational resources. The eMPC was implemented
   for rapid prototyping on the Ethernut 5 open-source hardware, and its
   performance was tested for a simulated process. The concept was tested
   using a real MPC application developed for a prototype of a new
   industrial process that requires an advanced embedded multivariable,
   constraint handling control solution. The results confirm the viability
   of the embedded MPC design approach. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{From the rising number of hackerspaces to an increase in hardware
   start-ups, maker culture is envisioned as an enabler of the next
   industrial revolutiona source of unhindered technological innovation, a
   revamp of broken economies and educational systems. Drawing from
   long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China's
   makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in
   implementing this vision. China's makers demonstrate that the future of
   makingif to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers,
   politicians, and scholars of the global tech industryrests on taking
   seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making
   outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon
   Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China's
   first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move
   away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting
   China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article
   demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses
   and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics,
   they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied
   in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in
   Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position
   China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening
   in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and
   innovation along geographical lines. This article contributes to
   critical scholarship of innovation and making cultures, technological
   expertise, and authorship.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate, the most oxidized form of nitrogen, is regulated to protect
   people and animals from harmful levels as there is a large over
   abundance due to anthropogenic factors. Widespread field testing for
   nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however,
   the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and
   quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An
   alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency
   Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this
   problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The
   development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly
   expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this
   goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical
   validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of
   performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This
   approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for
   toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the
   cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water
   quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The
   device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for
   less than 15\% of the cost for materials. This allows for greater access
   to the technology and the new, safer nitrate testing technique.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach to developing a vehicle communication
   platform consisting of a low-cost, open-source hardware for moving
   vehicle data to a secure server, a Web Application Programming Interface
   (API) for the provision of third-party services, and an intuitive user
   dashboard for access control and service distribution. The CloudThink
   infrastructure promotes the commoditization of vehicle telematics data
   by facilitating easier, flexible, and more secure access. It enables
   drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple
   applications to improve the transportation experience for all
   stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The
   foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which,
   taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to
   entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for
   projecting physical vehicles into the cloud. The application space
   initially consists of a few fundamental and important applications
   (vehicle tethering and remote diagnostics, road-safety monitoring, and
   fuel economy analysis) but as CloudThink begins to gain widespread
   adoption, the multiplexing of applications on the same data structure
   and set will accelerate its adoption.}},

Abstract = {{The new open-source quadrotor platform called X4-MaG presented here was
   developed for academic and research applications. X4-MaG is a small,
   low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of
   controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to
   powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments
   presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software
   embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a
   quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational
   resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It
   was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on
   quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice
   greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and
   estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly
   implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom
   made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new
   Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found
   to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than
   3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1). The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds
   greater than 2m.s(-1) and reject attitude disturbances of 20' within
   0.8s.}},

Abstract = {{One often-overlooked factor when selecting a platform for large-scale
   electrophysiology is whether or not a particular data acquisition system
   is `open' or `closed': that is, whether or not the system's schematics
   and source code are available to end users. Open systems have a
   reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard
   to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated
   circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for
   collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We
   discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular
   electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe
   examples of successful community-driven tool development within this
   field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to
   reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move
   toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data
   processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to
   modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to
   benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by
   commercial vendors.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability has become a major concern in many countries and is
   leading to strict regulations regarding the impact of products and
   services during their manufacturing, use, and disposal. Power
   consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a
   reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower
   expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the
   entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of
   material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive
   and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing
   sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an
   attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this
   paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on
   open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption
   monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy
   efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of
   the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the
   data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main
   sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a
   microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data
   storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends
   on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 \%. Solutions are
   suggested to improve the energy efficiency of the machine tool
   considered in this work.}},

Title = {{Open-source 3-D printing technologies for education: Bringing additive
   manufacturing to the classroom}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both
   Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and
   Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two
   educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum
   engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential
   of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the
   combination of economic constraints affecting all educational
   environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the
   cost of technological tools and technological innovation.
   Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online
   instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high
   school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including
   traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop,
   and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the
   workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research,
   teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order
   to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its
   potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary
   post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in
   the classroom for one year.
   Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS
   technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and
   into their classrooms.
   Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and
   visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed
   engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex
   technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use
   RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice:
   Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from
   the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D
   printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative
   education.
   Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential
   to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from
   active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.

Abstract = {{The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of the
   environment in relation to the health and well-being of the occupants.
   It is a holistic concept, which considers several categories, each
   related to a specific environmental parameter. This article describes a
   low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor
   variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the
   traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some
   sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the
   possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and
   letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting
   complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have
   demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by
   applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of
   the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer
   has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating
   self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring
   System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it
   provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of
   professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and
   potential applications.}},

Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Determination of moisture content of soil is absolutely crucial and must
   be performed frequently to assure the quality of construction work. In a
   view to suppress the limitations and inaccuracies of the existing
   methods, a new concept is successfully implemented. Artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) and state-of-the-art electronic circuitry are embedded
   to realize an automatic measurement system based on an open-source
   computing platform. Moreover, to facilitate user interaction with the
   system, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is created. This
   system, from both the hardware and software perspective, brings new
   ideas in, not only the moisture content determination test, but in
   geotechnical engineering laboratory and field instrumentation in terms
   of accuracy, automation, and machine intelligence. It will be obvious
   from this work that open-source hardware and software embedded in test
   equipment can automate the whole test procedure for almost all types of
   tests in geotechnical engineering using appropriate sensor, and
   data-acquisition and processing routines. This paper presents the
   technical know-how of the system setup, hardware, and software
   development, workflow, and system validation for the determination of
   moisture content of subgrade soil in two distinct test modes-supervised
   and unsupervised. This work will demonstrate that, not only the test
   procedure can be automated, but time optimization is also possible,
   which results in at least 50 \% test time reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) applies constant electrical
   stimulation to specific brain regions to treat neurological disorders.
   Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent
   years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of
   pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the
   conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using
   open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system
   input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular
   formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that
   hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while
   electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino
   open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This
   allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer
   electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop
   DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and
   required on average only 56\% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS
   to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware
   include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and
   affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and
   warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop
   neuromodulation.}},

Abstract = {{What does open source mean for culture? For knowledge? As cultural
   production has come to be characterized by contribution as well as
   consumption and as alternative modes of intellectual property transfer
   challenge the dominant paradigm' that knowledge and information should
   be protected and monetized, the logic of open sourcing' has extended
   into many cultural spheres. This article positions openness' as a value
   that intermediates between re-usable software code, institutional
   transparency, and expanded opportunities for participation in knowledge
   production cultures. By observing and analyzing the expansion of
   openness' from computer software to electronics hardware, we can develop
   a framework that identifies the tensions between socio-cultural visions
   of knowledge commons and the realities of governing those commons. This
   research focuses in particular on the knowledge related to electronics
   hardware and other material objects governed by open hardware licenses.
   The insights in this article are valuable for anyone studying open
   source and peer production processes and the knowledge claims
   surrounding them.}},

Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Technology is changing at a rapid rate, opening up new possibilities
   within the health care domain. Advances such as open source hardware,
   personal medical devices, and mobile phone apps are creating
   opportunities for custom-made medical devices and personalized care.
   However, they also introduce new challenges in balancing the need for
   regulation (ensuring safety and performance) with the need to innovate
   flexibly and efficiently. Compared with the emergence of new
   technologies, health technology design standards and regulations evolve
   slowly, and therefore, it can be difficult to apply these standards to
   the latest developments. For example, current regulations may not be
   suitable for approaches involving open source hardware, an increasingly
   popular way to create medical devices in the maker community. Medical
   device standards may not be flexible enough when evaluating the
   usability of mobile medical devices that can be used in a multitude of
   different ways, outside of clinical settings. Similarly, while
   regulatory guidance has been updated to address the proliferation of
   health-related mobile phone apps, it can be hard to know if and when
   these regulations apply. In this viewpoint, we present three examples of
   novel medical technologies to illustrate the types of regulatory issues
   that arise in the current environment. We also suggest opportunities for
   support, such as advances in the way we review and monitor medical
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has
   produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks
   (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart
   sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This,
   combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase
   in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor
   networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol
   (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the
   Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of
   Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a
   lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into
   interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or
   even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network.
   This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the
   principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless
   sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and
   communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used
   as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental
   WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof
   of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding
   energy concerns are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality,
   with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer
   sectors. At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network
   communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same
   as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the
   Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources
   for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately,
   current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways,
   tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry
   and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an
   increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide
   selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be
   built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether
   these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper,
   we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against
   open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly
   prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that
   these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of
   performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf
   components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and
   sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development
   ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{ExpertEyes is a low-cost, open-source package of hardware and software
   that is designed to provide portable high-definition eyetracking. The
   project involves several technological innovations, including
   portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software
   support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all
   processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter
   estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel
   forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the
   corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in
   which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore
   breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the
   system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial
   eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4A degrees
   and best accuracy below 0.3A degrees, and with a typical precision (SD
   method) around 0.3A degrees and best precision below 0.2A degrees. Part
   of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The
   high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and
   recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the
   analog NTSC format. The software is freely downloadable, and complete
   hardware plans are available, along with sources for custom parts.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a flexible, simple to build, low-cost, and
   computer-controlled optical mirror actuator system, developed for
   undergraduate research laboratories. Geared motors for hobby robotics
   are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller in combination with an H
   bridge to finely position mirror mount actuators. We present a graphical
   user interface based on the Python script language. The price of the
   fully controlled actuator system is only a small fraction of the price
   of a commercial system. It can be quickly implemented due to the use of
   open-hardware electronics. We discuss the performance of the system and
   give an outlook for future expansions and use in advanced optical
   setups. (C) 2015 American Association of Physics Teachers.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching
   approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills
   in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with
   aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development.
   Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and
   connectedness, and from another the concept of independent,
   self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based
   on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was
   originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of
   radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was
   reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When
   Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was
   simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily
   running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote
   platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks
   to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor
   platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students
   developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as
   assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can
   be used both in educational, and in the research and development
   purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students
   worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence
   of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive
   domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data
   analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating
   the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and
   attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative
   communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that
   networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open
   source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi,
   give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and
   inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University
   of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous
   learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and
   programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching,
   hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are
   made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and
   Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and
   infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The
   presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking
   knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where
   radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and
   embodied.}},

Abstract = {{In 2015 NASA plans to launch a payload to 280 Km altitude on a sounding
   rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility. This payload will contain
   several novel technologies that work together to demonstrate
   methodologies for space sample return missions and for nanosatellite
   communications in general. The payload will deploy and test an
   Exo-Brake, which slows the payload aerodynamically, providing eventual
   de-orbit and recovery of future ISS samples through a Small Payload
   Quick Return project. In addition, this flight addresses future Mars
   mission entry technology, space-to-space communications using the
   Iridium Short Messaging Service (SMS), GPS tracking, and wireless
   sensors using the ZigBee protocol. SOAREX-8 is being assembled and
   tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) and the NASA Engineering and Safety
   Center (NESC) is funding sensor and communications work. Open source
   Arduino technology and software are used for system control. The ZigBee
   modules used are XBee units that connect analog sensors for temperature,
   air pressure and acceleration measurement wirelessly to the payload
   telemetry system. Our team is developing methods for power distribution
   and module mounting, along with software for sensor integration, data
   assembly and downlink. We have demonstrated relaying telemetry to the
   ground using the Iridium satellite constellation on a previous flight,
   but the upcoming flight will be the first time we integrate useful
   flight test data from a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Wireless sensor
   data will measure the aerodynamic efficacy of the Exo-Brake permitting
   further on-orbit flight tests of improved designs. The Exo-Brake is 5
   m(2) in area and will be stored in a container and deployed during
   ascent once the payload is jettisoned from the launch vehicle. We intend
   to further refine the hardware and continue testing on balloon launches,
   future sounding rocket flights and on nanosatellite missions. The use of
   standards-based and open-source hardware/software has allowed for this
   project to be completed with a very modest budget and a challenging
   schedule. There is a wealth of hardware and software available for both
   the Arduino platform and the XBee, all low-cost or open-source. Along
   with the Exo-Brake hardware and deployment discussion, this paper will
   describe in detail the system architecture emphasizing the successful
   use of open-source hardware and software to minimize effort and cost.
   Testing procedures, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation,
   success criteria and expected results will also be discussed. The use of
   Iridium short messaging capability for space-to-space links,
   standards-based wireless sensor networks, and other innovative
   communications technology are also presented.}},

   respins led to growing importance of comprehensive and automated design
   verification. Akin to software configuration management, it is becoming
   commonplace to maintain large hardware design code-bases with hardware
   configuration management tools. A missing piece of crucial technology in
   this approach is to manage design verification across evolving hardware
   designs. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for
   automatically localizing design errors across design versions. The
   proposed technique, EvoDeb, can be easily integrated into a hardware
   configuration management framework and is scalable for large designs. We
   demonstrate the efficacy of EvoDeb on a couple of bugs on open-source

Abstract = {{Wearable robotics is strongly oriented to humans. New applications for
   wearable robots are encouraged by the lightness and portability of new
   devices and the progress in human-robot cooperation strategies. In this
   paper, we propose the different design guidelines to realize a robotic

   followed for the realization of three prototypes obtained using rapid
   prototyping techniques, i.e., a 3D printer and an open hardware
   development platform. Both fully actuated and under-actuated solutions
   have been explored. In the proposed wearable design, the robotic
   extra-finger can be worn as a bracelet in its rest position. The
   availability of a supplementary finger in the human hand allows to
   enlarge its workspace, improving grasping and manipulation capabilities.
   This preliminary work is a first step towards the development of robotic
   extra-limbs able to increase human workspace and dexterity.}},

   are truly uncountable different possible hardware/software low cost
   choices available for University teaching which could be complementary
   or alternative to the commonly used teaching tools (LabVIEW (R), MATLAB
   (R), etc.). In effects, the use of open-source and open-hardware
   platforms can offer different advantages with respect to traditional
   ones; first, they assure a bottom-up approach, which guarantees a
   pleasant and constructive learning with a gradual comprehension of
   concepts from the simple ones to more complex ones. Then, these cheap
   and readily available platforms permit to verify (also at home) the
   theoretical concepts and the proposed exercises with low cost devices
   rather than with expensive ones. Finally, the learning outcomes of the
   basic courses are indispensable to advanced courses where sensors,

Abstract = {{Nowadays embedded systems have reached a great level of maturity and
   diffusion thanks to their small size, low power consumption, large
   connectivity and variety of application in everyday contexts. These
   systems, if properly structured and configured, can significantly
   increase the smartness of the environments where they are deployed,
   monitoring and continuously collecting data to be processed and
   elaborated. Such operations can be correctly executed, especially in
   large locations, if several embedded systems nodes are deployed under
   the design of an intelligent network. This paper presents SMuNe, a Smart
   Multisensor Network based on the BeableBone Black platform, a complete
   open hardware and software embedded computer; the challenge is to create
   a multi-purpose hierarchical network composed by smart nodes able to
   gain and manage heterogeneous data and spaces according to the Internet
   of Things (IoT) paradigm. As a proof of the effectiveness of SMuNe we
   conducted an experimentation within the Cultural Heritage domain; in

Abstract = {{During a disaster, conventional communications infrastructures are often
   compromised, which prevents local populations from contacting family,
   friends, and colleagues. The lack of communication also impedes
   responder efforts to gather, organize, and disseminate information. This
   problem is made worse by the unique cost and operational constraints
   typically associated with the humanitarian assistance and disaster
   relief (HADR) space. In response, we present a low-cost, scalable system
   that creates a wide-area, best-effort, ad-hoc wireless network for
   emergency information. The Communication Assistance Technology over
   Ad-Hoc Networks (CATAN) system embraces the maker and do it yourself
   (DIY) communities by leveraging open-source and hobbyist technologies to
   create cheap, lightweight, battery powered nodes that can be deployed
   quickly for a variety of operations. CATAN enables geographically
   separated users to share information on standard interfaces, i.e. web
   and SMS, over commonly-used communication interfaces, i.e. GSM and
   Wi-Fi. These interfaces enable CATAN to accommodate a variety of digital
   devices while leveraging the global ubiquity of cellular devices. By
   emphasizing simple, mature, technologies, CATAN avoids many problems
   that hinder many general purpose ad-hoc technologies. We have tested our
   infrastructure in a variety of environments and have open-sourced the
   entire project to encourage collaboration with the greater HADR
   community.}},

Abstract = {{The design and implementation of Smart Grids takes usually into account
   the participation of LV electrical energy consumers (through techniques
   such as Demand Response). However, there is still a lack of cost
   effective hardware and software solutions that would allow these

   energy consumption, take action towards achieving energy efficiency, and
   effectively participate in Demand Response programs. This paper aims to
   address this issue, presenting a complete, open source hardware and
   software solution, which enables measurements of electrical voltages and
   currents at the installation main distribution panel, the transmission
   and storage of the respective data in a personal computer, and their
   subsequent processing by the Cassandra open source software platform.
   The analysis of the proposed solution components is followed by results
   obtained by the implementation in a residential installation.}},

Abstract = {{Clock and/or frequency synchronization is a common requirement in modern
   distributed measurement and control systems, such as Internet of Things
   (IoT). The required precision is application dependent; however, the
   possibility of sub 1 microsecond precision provided by low-cost advanced
   IEEE 1588 implementations sets the industry standard today. The
   performance and price of IEEE 1588 implementations are primarily defined
   by the master clocks and their actual installation and configuration.
   The paper investigate how master clock architectures, i.e., how the
   master clock is connected to the reference clock, influence price and
   performance; and in addition, it also details how the architecture
   effects installation and configuration requirements. The primary factors
   of investigation are ambient temperature and delay compensation required
   due to signal transmission time. The paper also introduces the
   architecture and performance of a Linux based open source/hardware
   prototype master clock developed by the author.}},

Abstract = {{Timing is critical when trying to engage students in various engineering
   career paths. While many ``National Engineers Week{''} programs exist
   for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on
   activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to
   devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not
   juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are
   lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting
   opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen
   years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social
   events, and activities are particularly high.(1). There are a number of
   open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be
   used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote
   innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as
   well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We
   have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade
   levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate
   students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used
   to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic
   elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be
   set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and
   collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting
   exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software
   engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other
   engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion
   of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno,
   Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed
   to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field
   trip.}},

Abstract = {{During last years unmanned ground and aerial vehicles captured the
   attention of researchers and companies, while the available set of
   Unmanned Surface Vehicle platforms is smaller. In many scenarios an
   integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of
   vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost
   unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been
   designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design.
   An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been
   deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the
   proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software
   solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for
   the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to
   map the sea/lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely
   controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application
   has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks
   that are mapped/not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful
   when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the
   autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are
   satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a Detection System Crisis Episodes of
   depression in older adults. The system allows monitoring wirelessly
   through two modules: movement patterns and physiological markers of the
   patient. The first module is open technology based as is Raspberry Pi
   and Open CV to process images to identify movement patterns. The second
   module uses an Arduino pro mini with temperature and pulse sensor to
   logging information of the physiological data (heart rate and
   temperature). The information obtained is processed on a Web server
   through an application for viewing in a Web page or mobile device. With
   this information the attending physician or can correlate the
   variability of heart rate, temperature and movement pattern and
   determine by monitoring the state of the Depression in Elderly. This
   system is designed to send alert messages via MSN to physician and
   family in emergency situations such as extreme temperatures, irregular
   heartbeat, and absence or excess movement.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades drop-on-demand inkjet technology played an
   increasing role in industrial and medical applications. This is due to
   the ability to deposit a small amount of material in precisely defined
   position. In the field of Biofabrication, inkjet printers are used to
   build 2D and 3D scaffolds and gels with biological molecules, including
   living cells. Several works, including seminal papers on inkjet
   bioprinting, were carried out with modified office printers. These
   printers have fixed structural characteristics and operating size,
   especially on the print-head, limiting the range of materials that can
   be dispensed. The aim of the present work is the design and fabrication
   of an open-source piezoelectric inkjet print-head, optimized for the
   bioprinting field. This low-cost, reproducible, reliable, versatile and
   biocompatible device will enable various research laboratories to work
   with a shared device; the open source allowing for parts to be modified
   to suit specific needs. The design was carried out by Finite Element
   (FE) modelling of the piezoelectric, mechanical, fluid dynamics and
   their coupling. The design was optimized for shear rate, which we
   minimized in order to be able to print cells. The mechanical frame of
   the printer was designed and built using a low-cost 3D printer. The
   nozzle plate was fabricated from a polycarbonate disc coated with
   biocompatible silicone, to increase the hydrophobicity of the outer
   surface of the disc, preventing ink adhesion on the edge of the nozzle;
   the refilling system, and the electronic control were also part of the
   project and will be freely available to download. The FE models were
   validated with ad-hoc experiments, printing water, gelatin solution, and
   cell culture media, by modulating the wave power in amplitude, frequency
   and duty cycle. The tests showed a large working window both respect to
   viscosity and to surface tension. Finally Human Skin Fibroblasts
   (ATCC-CRL-2522, Teddington UK), suspended in culture media, were
   printed. Cell viability, assessed by CellTiter-Blue and LIVE / DEAD
   tests, resulted comparable with the control, demonstrating the validity
   of the first open source piezoelectric inkjet print-head for
   biofabrication. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

Abstract = {{Decision making of a vertebrate in response to the sensory signals from
   the environment is regulated by the neuromodulatory systems in its
   brain. A vertebrate's behaviors like focusing attention, cautious
   risk-aversion and curiosity seeking exploration are influenced by these
   neuromodulatory. The paper presents an autonomous robotic control
   approach based on vertebrate neuromodulation and its implementation on
   multiple open-source hardware platforms. A simple neural network is used
   to model the neuromodulatory functions for generating context based
   behavioral responses to sensory signals. The neural network incorporates
   three types of neurons- attention focusing cholinergic and noradrenergic
   (ACh/NE), curiosity-seeking dopaminergic (DA), and risk aversive
   serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The implementation of the neuronal model on
   multiple relatively simple autonomous robots is illustrated through the
   interesting behavior of the robots adapting to changes in the
   environment. The implementation is done in open-source, open-access
   robotics software framework of Robot Operating System (ROS).}},

Abstract = {{A very serious problem has been identified for past many years that
   paralyzed human beings became isolated from the society for not having a
   proper existence and due to their reluctances of doing normal life
   works. Therefore, we have researched on the Human Machine Interaction
   using Physical Human Body Gestures and came up to proposed solution of
   the said issue as Low Cost Retina Controlled Computer Using Head mount
   and Wrist Tilt for Persons who are Paralyzed and cannot be able to move
   their hands and even they can't able to walk. Conventionally, we named
   it as simple as Retina Controlled Computer, is based on Google Glass
   vision using motion recognition, Zigbee Wireless Technology, Retina
   Controlled Device that allows human beings with paralysis resulting from
   Paralysis to do everything on computer even controlling the personal
   mobile phone using only their Eye and Head movements. This whole project
   will be based mainly on the new technology of Low Cost Wireless Zigbee
   Sensors, Arduino Microcontrollers, and motion and retina recognition
   using Accelerometer. Arduino Microcontroller consists of an open-source
   hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller, or a
   32-bit Atmel ARM. Therefore, making an Intelligent Low Cost Eye

Abstract = {{Engineering education, in the field of Computer science and Information
   technology, has the greatest challenges today. These challenges are
   shaped by the rapid growth of communication systems usage and the
   appearance of new technologies. Currently, there is a variety of
   emerging technologies such as: Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4,
   ZigBee, 6lowWPAN, etc. In order to enable easy and fast implementation
   of these technologies in University courses, the building of the
   low-cost, flexible and scalable platform with support of these

Abstract = {{A plenitude of technology is neither developed in-house nor simply
   outsourced in dyadic relationships. Instead, we are in a new age where
   technologies are developed by a networked community of actors and
   organizations, which base their relations dynamically to each other on a
   common interest. Such dynamic and networked complexity of technology
   development is often theoretical explored around the concept of
   platform, and more recently by employing the concept of ecosystem in an
   analogy to natural ecosystems. Following the success of open-source
   software, academics have long been examining openness in digital
   platforms/ecosystems; however most contributions take the perspective of
   a single stakeholder from the many that constitute a digital
   platform/ecosystem. Predominantly, they take the sole perspective of
   platform providers, those bundling hardware and software or more rarely,
   the perspective of third-party software developers developing valuable
   software `apps' that add value to the overall platform. In this
   conceptual article, we grasp openness more holistically, both by
   acknowledging that openness means different things to different people
   and involve all stakeholders within the platforms/ecosystems. Towards
   the development of a theory of openness within digital settings, we
   propose six novel aspects of openness for enabling a greater
   understanding of the open-source software movement with a digital
   platforms/ecosystems perspective. Moreover, we invite scholars to
   reconsider the more predominating product-dominant logic in open-source
   software research to a more holistic logic embracing platforms and
   ecosystem thinking.}},

Abstract = {{The design of sensing systems powered from energy harvesting can be
   complex. Design decisions are required concerning the properties and
   parameters of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage devices. The
   quantity and properties of environmental energy are typically both
   temporally and spatially variant, while the current consumption of the
   load electronics also changes dynamically. In this paper we describe
   Enspect, an open-source hardware/software tool which simplifies the
   design of energy harvesting sensing systems by assisting in the
   specification of harvesting and storage devices. It does this by
   enabling the long-term collection of data on energy availability, and

Abstract = {{Technological devices of all kinds are becoming more common in our daily
   lives: smart devices are being incorporated in buildings, houses, cars,
   and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The new devices
   give us an unusual degree of connectivity in our regular activities, for
   example when we employ our tablets or smart phones to check email or
   browse the public network, but also in more innovative forms of
   connectivity, such as receiving notifications directly from our
   refrigerator or collecting information from our clothes and shoes. This
   technological revolution brings new opportunities and challenges for
   users, businesses, and society. This paper explores such a new context,
   where we begin to co-exist and interact with a network of interconnected
   devices that is known as the Internet of Things. The objective of the
   project is to implement a solution for communicating devices that
   monitor, in real-time, the structural health of a bridge. The
   implementation is based on 6LoWPAN, a standard based on the IPv6
   protocol over low-power and lossy networks to support the Internet of
   Things. We employ open hardware platforms and emphasize the
   singularities of embedded systems, such as a limited number of
   operations, low power consumption, and low bandwidth capability. The
   prototype shown in this work uses the 6LoWPAN standard in a network
   environment that connects with a real Bridge Management System, with the
   aim of optimizing the maintenance of road structures.}},

Abstract = {{Performance improvements of a single-core processor relying on high
   clock rates reached the limit. Instead of a single-core processor,
   multi-core and many-core processors have been mainstream to accelerate
   applications by parallel processing. Year by year, the number of cores
   integrated in a single chip has been increased due to improvements of
   semiconductor integration technologies depending on Moore's Law. On the
   other hand, Moore's Law will be ended in the near future. This means
   that the approaches relying on the increase in the number of cores will
   be hopeless, thus we have to consider other effective ways. One of them
   is to design application specific hardware. Several research
   organizations have explored it and reported its remarkable findings. We
   focus on such an acceleration approach with dedicated hardware.
   As a case study with dedicated hardware, we present a sorting
   acceleration method. Sorting is an extremely important computation
   kernel that should be accelerated in a lot of fields, such as databases,
   image processing, data compression, etc. We propose a sorting
   accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, and detail
   the design and implementation. Our proposed sorting accelerator is
   customizable, thus designers can implement a sorting accelerator
   composed of required hardware resources by means of tuning design
   parameters. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up
   to 10.06x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-4770
   operating at 3.4GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. In
   order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator,
   the RTL source code is released as an open-source hardware.}},

   To do this, the Lab-In-A-Box brings a full powered Digital Signal
   Processor (DSP) core to the popular Arduino microcontroller environment
   and marries it with a simple to use analog front end (AFE). The software
   platform provided with the Lab-In-A-Box includes an Arduino-like

Abstract = {{Competitive solutions to the growing demand for home automation will
   most likely include the use of low cost components, open source and open
   hardware. Using the ZigBee protocol, a low cost lighting control
   actuator was developed that was battery efficient and easy to use in a
   home automation system environment. Raspberry Pi was used to house a Web
   server, which provided the user an adaptive web application to access
   the lighting actuator control. XBee modules were chosen for their small
   size, low energy consumption and the large amount of documentation that
   exists in regard to its use. Considering the worst-case scenario, the
   lighting control actuator was designed so if its battery runs out of
   power or the ZigBee network fails, it can work as a normal light switch.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces OpenMote, the latest generation of Berkeley motes.
   OpenMote is a open-hardware prototyping ecosystem designed to accelerate
   the development of the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT). It
   features the OpenMote-CC2538, a state-of-the-art computing and
   communication device. This device interfaces with several other
   accessories, or ``skins{''}, through a standardized connector. The skins
   developed to date include boards to provide power, boards which enable a
   developer to easily debug the platform, and boards to allow seamless
   integration of an OpenMote network into the Internet.
   This hardware ecosystem is complemented by a suite of software tools and
   ports to popular open-source IoT implementations. The OpenMote platform
   is for example tailored to run the OpenWSN open-source implementation of
   emerging IIoT standards. The combination of hardware and software
   ecosystems gives an embedded programmer an intuitive and complete
   development environment, and an end-user a fully working low-power
   wireless mesh networking solution running the latest IIoT standards.}},

Abstract = {{Principles of openness and collaboration that catalyze open-source
   software innovation have also been successfully transferred into the
   world of hardware {[}1]. Advances in open-source hardware allow
   students, researchers and hobbyists to custom build devices for a wide
   variety of purposes. Open-source prototyping platforms like Arduino and
   Raspberry Pi empower people to build cheap, modular, and easy to use
   alternatives to expensive commercial grade scientific equipment. The
   authors argue that the use of open-source hardware in building neuroIS
   research tools will dramatically decrease the costs and complexity
   associated with research in university laboratories. In this work, we
   discuss the use of open-source hardware in neuroIS research. We present
   the design of a neuroIS research tool based on BITalino, a biosignal
   capturing and processing platform. We also present a novel prototype
   that is specifically tuned toward neuroIS research using the API
   provided by the creators of BITalino.}},

Abstract = {{This paper suggests that Mass-Individualization, which is based on a
   consumer product that consists of an open hardware platform and multiple
   modules that are interfaced with the platform, will constitute the next
   paradigm in product design. Customers will be able to adapt the open
   platform to their needs by integrating modules of their choice into the
   platform, thereby constructing individual products that fit their exact
   needs. Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small
   companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with
   the open-platform products. Smartphones is an example of an
   open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on
   smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain
   Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone.
   The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered
   in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a
   new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the
   Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm
   will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module
   production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer
   products. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The number and complexity of control systems in wind turbines (WT) is
   expanding rapidly, and their design can be the difference between an
   immensely profitable system or a damaged system. Designing a robust
   control system requires to test the control algorithms in the actual
   controller hardware. However, WT are large and expensive, thus we would
   like to perform this test virtually, without using prototypes of the WT.
   This work develops a fault diagnosis (FD) and fault tolerant control
   (FTC) of pitch actuators in wind turbines. This is accomplished by
   combining a disturbance compensator with a controller, both of which are
   formulated in the discrete-time domain. The disturbance compensator has
   a dual purpose: to reconstruct the actuator fault (which is used by the
   FD technique) and to design the discrete-time controller to obtain a
   FTC. That is, the actuator faults are reconstructed and then the control
   inputs are modified to achieve a FTC with a comparable behavior to the
   fault-free case. The performance of the FD and FTC schemes is tested in
   a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testbed for WT controllers. The used
   controller hardware is an open hardware Arduino board which is connected
   to the virtual WT via USB. The onshore 5MW turbine is simulated on the
   open-source National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator FAST
   (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence). The proposed HiL is
   used to characterize the behavior of the WT in the full load region in

Abstract = {{The Open Compute Project, OCP (http://www.opencompute.org/), was
   launched by Facebook in 2011 with the objective of building efficient
   computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. The technologies
   are released as open hardware, with the goal to develop servers and data
   centres following the model traditionally associated with open source
   software projects. In 2013 CERN acquired a few OCP servers in order to
   compare performance and power consumption with standard hardware. The
   conclusions were that there are sufficient savings to motivate an
   attempt to procure a large scale installation. One objective is to
   evaluate if the OCP market is sufficiently mature and broad enough to
   meet the constraints of a public procurement. This paper summarizes this
   procurement, which started in September 2014 and involved the Request
   for information (RFI) to qualify bidders and Request for Tender (RFT).}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The new technology ensures 3D laparoscopic vision by adding
   depth to the traditional two dimensions. This realistic vision gives the
   surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of
   Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in
   2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to
   evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and
   safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative
   validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of
   the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at
   demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and
   software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost
   increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of
   appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform
   a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms
   of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between
   laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D.
   METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise
   through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise
   consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped
   by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising
   videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a
   anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to
   pass ``needle and thread{''} without touching the metal part in the
   shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a
   coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the
   positioning and from the point of view.
   RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has
   mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve
   lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with
   respect to 2D.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the rapid change in cellular technologies, Mobile Network
   Operators (MNOs) keep a high percentage of their deployed infrastructure
   using Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technologies. With
   about 3.5 billion subscribers, GSM remains as the de facto standard for
   cellular communications. However, the security criteria envisioned 30
   years ago, when the standard was designed, are no longer sufficient to
   ensure the security and privacy of the users. Furthermore, even with the
   newest fourth generation (4G) cellular technologies starting to be
   deployed, these networks could never achieve strong security guarantees
   because the MNOs keep backwards-compatibility given the huge amount of
   GSM subscribers. In this paper, we present and describe the tools and
   necessary steps to perform an active attack against a GSM-compatible
   network, by exploiting the GSM protocol lack of mutual authentication
   between the subscribers and the network. The attack consists of a
   so-called man-in-the-middle attack implementation. By using Software
   Defined Radio (SDR), open-source libraries and open-source hardware, we
   setup a fake GSM base station to impersonate the network and therefore
   eavesdrop any communications that are being routed through it and
   extract information from their victims. Finally, we point out some
   implications of the protocol vulnerabilities and how these can not be
   mitigated in the short term since 4G deployments will take long time to
   entirely replace the current GSM infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{The great usefulness of remote recording of biomedical signals in most
   aspects of daily life has generated an increasing interest in this
   field. Traditionally, monitoring devices from clinical enviroments are
   bulky, intrusive, and expensive. Thus, the development of wearable,
   mobile, and low-cost applications is desirable. Nevertheless, recent
   improvements in open-hardware allow developing low cost devices and
   portable designs for biosignal monitoring in out-of-lab applications,
   such as sports, leisure, e-Health, etc. This paper presents a low-cost
   wearable system able to simultaneously record electrical brain and heart
   activity (i.e. electroencephalography and electrocardiography). The
   system is able to send biomedical data to a platform for remote
   analyses. Both software and hardware are open-source. We assessed the
   system for its validity and reliability in a real road environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper designs a indoor environmental quality monitoring system, in
   which indoor environment parameters, such as temperature, humidity and
   PM2.5 density can be gathered, transmitted and displayed. Arduino, a
   open-source hardware and software platforms, is used to access sensors.
   With the help of ZigBee, which is a new wireless communication protocol
   characterized by low-power, devices composed of Arduino and sensors are
   placed in different rooms so that the energy consumption can be
   effectively reduced. In addition, an specific transmission protocol is
   also be defined for this system. Finally sensor data are transmitted to
   the internal server and then a cloud platform via WiFi. The result shows
   that this system is stable and easy to build and change network.}},

Abstract = {{Current state of the art's real time monitoring of fresh produce,
   provides only temperature and humidity information {[}1-3]. The idea is
   to develop new sensors and transport service assisted by ICT platform to
   monitor fresh produce quality. The technology will be based on radio
   frequency (RF) wireless network, and will provide real-time and in-site
   data-logging, enabling active management of food products in storage and
   transit. The RF sensor network design, allows an auxiliary sensor node
   to be ``plugged in{''}. In this contribution we present the commercial
   platform developed starting from o fork of open hardware on which we
   assemble an array of commercial sensors in an ``open air{''}
   configuration. We developed for this Embedded Gas Sensor System Device
   (Tinynose) two set-up: the ``Development set-up{''} that uses a star
   wireless network infrastructure to store all raw sensor output and
   associated measurement error in a server DB to define parameters in

Abstract = {{Safety-critical systems and certification standards are the bare
   essential elements for the development process of avionics, automotive
   and industrial embedded systems. The necessity of including non-safety
   capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new
   type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems
   should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same
   time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the
   integrity of the safetycritical tasks. This paper presents a new system
   architecture which includes safetycritical and non-safety-critical parts
   in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a
   reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA)
   architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time
   operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core
   communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications.
   Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external
   processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The
   ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to
   insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities
   of the safetycritical part. This platform is described providing
   evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and
   non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an
   updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system
   is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe
   emergency stop applications for industrial machinery.}},

Abstract = {{More than 50 billion devices are estimated to be connected to the
   Internet by 2020. Incompatibility of devices and protocols (usually
   proprietary devices and protocols) are one of the major hurdles to be
   overcome to realise the Internet of Things (IoT) vision. IoT devices are
   typically constrained devices and this creates dependencies between the
   hardware, software and protocols used in the device. Open hardware and
   software platforms to support emerging IoT trends are required. A
   wireless sensor network gateway was developed in a three-month period
   using off-the-shelf components. The gateway was based on the Raspberry
   PI single-board computer; it implemented 6LoWPAN mesh and wireless
   access point functionality for mobile and low power sensing and
   actuation devices. The gateway was tested in the following use-case:
   integrate a battery-operated 6LoWPAN-enabled smart water meter to an
   IPv6 building network. Several factors that influence the gateway's
   performance and reliability were identified and should be considered
   when deploying gateway devices for future endeavours.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we examine the challenges of developing intelligent
   wireless geosystems and the pros and cons of interdisciplinary research.
   First, we summarize the range of current practices in wireless sensor
   network research projects by analyzing recent contributions in the
   literature. Specifically, for each wireless sensor network project, we
   compile details regarding the scope (e.g., simulation, testbed, real
   deployment), the type of mote used (e.g., TinyOS, Android, Arduino), and
   the type of sensors used (e.g., inertial, biological).
   Next, we discuss reasons why Arduino based wireless devices are perhaps
   the future of applied wireless sensor network research. Arduino-based
   systems are inexpensive, easy to use, readily available, well
   documented, 100\% open-source (hardware and software), object oriented,
   extendable (using the ``shield{''} concept), and flexible (e.g., in
   terms of radio choices). Lastly, we discuss the pros and cons of
   interdisciplinary research; that is, we highlight the struggle between
   working on difficult, relevant, inherently multi-disciplinary research
   problems while maintaining scholarship in individual fields.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging environmental related problems have greater impact on
   technical, scientific, social and economical fields, which is why this
   issue needs attention. On a global scale this issue are being sort out
   using satellite based instruments. This paper discusses a monitoring
   system which gives information about environmental conditions on a more
   local level, the implementation area are categorize by industrial, home
   and office applications and briefly touches the technological
   advancements in monitoring the environment and bringing out the new
   scope in monitoring the current environment problems. This paper intends
   to provide information using wireless sensor technology which comprises
   of raspberry pi, Arduino Nano, Zigbee, wireless sensor network(WSN) and
   sensors. Realization of data gathered by sensors based on embedded
   raspbian linux is displayed on Graphical User Interface (GUI). The
   system is developed using open source hardware raspberry pi and Zigbee
   which proves to be cost effective and having low power consumption. The
   sensors will gather the data of various environmental parameters and
   provide it to raspberry pi which act as a base station. Some sensors
   will directly process the data and provide it to the raspberry pi while
   some sensors will provide the data through Arduino Nano to raspberry pi
   using serial interface. The raspberry pi will then transmit the data
   using Zigbee and the processed data will be displayed on GUI through
   Zigbee that is on the receiver side.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, customized AT software solutions allow their users to interact
   with various kinds of computer systems. Such tools are generally
   available on personal devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops and so on)
   commonly used by a person with a disability. In this paper, we
   investigate a way of using the aforementioned AT equipments in order to
   access many different devices without assistive preferences. The
   solution takes advantage of open source hardware and its core component
   consists of an affordable Linux embedded system: it grabs data coming
   from the assistive software, which runs on the user's personal device,
   then, after processing, it generates native keyboard and mouse HID
   commands for the target computing device controlled by the end user.
   This process supports any operating system available on the target
   machine and it requires no specialized software installation; therefore
   the user with a disability can rely on a single assistive tool to
   control a wide range of computing platforms, including conventional
   computers and many kinds of mobile devices, which receive input commands
   through the USB HID protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present TalkBox, an affordable
   and open-source communication board for users with communication or
   speech disorders. Making and tinkering methods are combined with
   community engagement and participatory design to create a democratic and
   accessible approach to assistive technology design.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors employed a community-engaged
   participatory design methodology where we incorporated input from
   stakeholders into the design of the interface. Close collaboration with
   our community partner allowed us to make informed decisions on different
   aspects of the design from sourcing of the material to testing the
   prototype.
   Findings - Through describing TalkBox, the paper presents a concrete
   example of how assistive technology can be designed and deployed more
   democratically, how collaborations between academia and community
   partners can be established, and how the design reflects different
   aspects of the methodology used.
   Originality/value - This paper explores the question of how can
   open-source technology and making methods contribute to the development
   of more affordable and inclusive designs through a concrete example.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter examines the use of Open Source Software (OSS) technologies
   that can be used to improve the learning of Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Explored are the various methods
   that can be utilized to improve the percentage of STEM majors in the
   American educational system with resources such as: Open Source as
   Alternative (OSALT), virtualization, cloud computing, Linux
   distributions, open source programming, and open source hardware
   platforms. Increasing the amount of students that pursue STEM majors is
   important because the projected job growth in the STEM field compared to
   non-STEM jobs is 33\%. OSALT provides cost-effective alternatives to
   commercial products such as Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop.
   Second, creating Virtual Machines (VMs) is another avenue to teach
   complex concepts in computer science, engineering, and Information
   Technology (IT). Third, cloud computing is an inexpensive way for
   clients to access information from multiple locations and devices.
   Fourth, universities can use the Operating System (OS) Linux and its
   various distributions as replacements for commercial operating systems
   like Windows in order to reduce IT costs. Lastly, open source
   programming languages like Python and their associated Integrated
   Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive facilities for
   software engineers for application development or testing.}},

   resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not
   appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been
   applied in two public schools from Ararangua/SC that also face
   difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students
   use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments
   accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the
   Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a
   collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab
   staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi.
   The study presented here intends to facilitate the experiments
   adaptation and motivate other research labs to make their experiments

Abstract = {{Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and
   coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented
   towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision
   irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of
   instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of
   sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open
   hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content
   at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on
   an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple
   integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency
   dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three
   non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves
   were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and
   normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the
   overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08
   for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data
   very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate
   very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63;
   RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically
   sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks.
   This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a
   customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach
   whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates
   the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of network speeds to tens of gigabits per second poses a
   challenge to develop packet processing applications that can cope with
   such bit rates. Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system
   that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network
   functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate
   timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All
   these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions,
   but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main
   obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the
   cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills
   required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level
   languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based
   networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to
   the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article,
   we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for
   networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming
   model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this,
   we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and
   compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware
   development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that
   development time is reduced from months to weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming
   allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their
   laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically
   designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of
   on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university
   chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware
   and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple
   module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on
   a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino).
   The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned
   using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to
   fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or
   facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of
   two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and
   mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of
   the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and
   analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration,
   followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost
   detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible
   (98\%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.}},

Abstract = {{In this modern world many communication devices are highly intelligent
   and interconnected between each other. Any up-gradation of the hardware
   in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility
   of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the
   new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for
   these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware
   design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in
   technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and
   software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This
   can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as
   Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work
   demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community

Abstract = {{Rapid prototyping is a key aspect for the development of innovative
   robotic applications. A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to
   obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software
   development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions
   every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in
   the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation
   of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To
   overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a
   framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic
   systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and
   controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled
   in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for
   real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as
   tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at
   dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype
   robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of
   new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation.
   This enables also people with experience in a specific application
   domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in
   the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in
   its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics
   community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the
   costs to design a new robotic product. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{StimSync: Open-source hardware for behavioral and MRI experiments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{227}},
Pages = {{90-99}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many neuroscience experiments rely on presenting stimuli and
   measuring participants' responses to these events. Often computer
   screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices
   are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies
   present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise,
   keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small
   animals or individuals with motor impairments.
   New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs,
   allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure
   button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems,
   changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial
   electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the
   USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also
   be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to
   validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events,
   visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs,
   StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external
   devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how
   this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays.
   Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17
   ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms).
   Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms
   two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices
   described in the literature.
   Conclusions: StimSync
   (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an
   open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience
   experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch
   of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations.

Abstract = {{Turbidity is an internationally recognized criterion for assessing

   may harbor pathogens, chemically reduce oxidizing disinfectants, and

   by measuring the scattering of light passing through a water sample

   hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of

   turbidimeter based on a single light-to-frequency sensor was designed

Abstract = {{The ever-intensifying time-to-market pressure imposes great challenges
   on the pre-silicon design phase of hardware. Before the tape-out, a
   pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming
   functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional
   verification and code review, a critical issue determining their
   efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources
   and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally
   guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and
   straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free
   modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the
   success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel
   framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information
   of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine
   learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design
   characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to
   predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design.
   Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources
   among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and
   code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon
   bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several
   open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts
   of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on
   the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with
   appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90\% modules
   could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of
   each module could also be accurately predicted.}},

Abstract = {{A mobile and modular educational robotic platform called ``Yrobot{''} is
   presented for the purpose of increasing students interest in studying
   technical suNects, to support teaching and to promote the selected areas
   of the information and communication technologies. The developed mobile
   robotic system is open hardware. Its base part - a mobile robotic
   platform - is being continuously extended by expansion modules to enable
   the development and implementation of the specific applications. As the
   first expansion module for the ``Yrobot{''}, an audio-communication
   subsystem module based on Texas Instruments solutions has been
   developed. This extension module is called ``AudioCom{''} and allows the
   development and verification of the simple modulation techniques
   operation. These techniques are commonly used in the radio frequency
   communication as well. This paper describes the motivation for the
   development of the mentioned platform, the expansion module circuit
   design, software solution and the experimental testing results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and testing of a mobile sensing kit for
   real-time urban site analysis. It aims to contribute to a discussion on
   the importance of sensing-based mapping of urban phenomena following our
   assertion that current delivery of urban analysis methodologies, with
   their emphasis on visuo-spatial analysis only, fail to create maps that
   reflect the nuanced and layered interrelationships between the people
   and the physical environmental space they live in. In essence, the paper
   will bring to light the set up components and deployment of a mobile
   sensing kit that allows for usually mapped static invisible data (air
   quality, temperature, humidity) to be mapped as visible data. In other
   words, we want to explore how real-time geo-referenced data collection
   can enhance traditional data mapping and visualization methods enabling
   designers to understand better the urban space.}},

Abstract = {{Today, the environmental monitoring and quality have a growing interest.
   This promotes the development of new monitoring tools, and especially
   those with outstanding reliability and response time, and nonstationary
   features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a
   transportable gas detection and environmental monitoring device. Ideas
   taken from the Arduino and Lego constructions are kept in mind during
   the design of the device, looking further facilitate the development of
   product family of this device; likewise, the use of reconfigurable and
   interconnectable platforms with open hardware are considered. The
   transducers have been selected based on their reliability, small size
   and easy inclusion in an electronic system. Then, was developed a device
   that supports transducers for environmental gases, such as: carbon
   monoxide (CO), ozone (O-3), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2); as well as the possibility to
   interface with other systems for common gases such as carbon dioxide
   (CO2) and oxygen (O-2) before developed. Other environmental measures
   such as speed and wind direction, temperature and relative humidity, may
   also be included. In this case, a configurable platform based on
   mixed-signal circuits, PSoC5, was used for the development of embedded
   system. This platform can be interfaced with different Arduino shields
   and achieves the integration of several analog functions. This system
   manages, acquires and processes signals from the above transducers. The
   measurements can be displayed on an LCD display, save into an SD memory
   and send to the Web using Ethernet interface. The device is hand size,
   easy to carry and can operate with a battery. Its user interface is
   simple and provides updated and in-situ readings. Currently, successful
   results have been obtained from the functional and metrology testing of
   the manufactured prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of electrical motors through the detection of fault
   frequency signatures in the current's spectrum has become an established
   standard in the field of industrial maintenance systems. Nevertheles,
   its implementation on devices with low computing power remains a
   practical challenge. Industrial controllers, such as programmable logic
   controllers, or modern, low cost controller hardware, such as the
   Arduino or the Raspberry Pi open source hardware proposals, lack both
   the on-board memory and the high speed data acquisition hardware to
   perform an accurate spectral analysis of the machine's current, in order
   to identify the spectral components produced by each type of fault. In
   this paper, a signal conditioning unit, based on a novel downsampling
   method of the current, is presented. This unit reduces the amount of
   current samples that must be processed by the diagnostic unit to a mere
   sample per current cycle, maintains the sub-hertz accuracy needed to
   resolve fault, and converts the mains component into a constant value
   that can be easily eliminated without using any additional filter.
   Besides, it is implemented using low cost devices, just resistors and
   operational amplifiers. The proposed method is theoretically developed
   in this paper, and it has been validated using induction motors with
   broken bars fed directly by the mains or through variable speed drives.}},

Abstract = {{A key issue in VoIP services market is the availability of tools that
   permit a constant monitoring of the relevant Quality of Service (QoS)
   parameters. Several commercial and open-source solutions are available,
   based on dedicated hardware and/or open-source software. These solutions
   aim to achieve a tradeoff between performance and instrumentation cost.
   In general, high performance and precise monitoring tools are based on
   dedicated hardware, which is expensive. In contrast, cheaper
   software-based solutions working on top of a Commercially available
   Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware are performance-limited, especially when
   serving high-capacity links. In this context, the paper presents an
   open-source solution for QoS monitoring of VoIP traffic that achieves
   high performance at significantly lower costs. The proposed solution
   exploits the performance capabilities achievable with a
   field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The associated costs reduction
   arises from the high flexibility of an FPGA. Our experimental analysis
   explores the accuracy of the developed prototype, measuring against
   relevant QoS parameters of VoIP traffic on high capacity links.}},

   understanding the design process of HT ``Solutions{''} to be made
   available as open source. The 2011 competition was an initial effort to
   understand open source licensing, open source hardware and the open
   source development model. Adoption of the open source development model
   was a stated objective of IEEE's Humanitarian technology Challenge (HTC)
   {[}2]. The HIC held a student paper competition in 2013. The goal of the
   2013 competition was to nurture the growing interest in Humanitarian
   Technology in Region 7; to address HIC's concerns from the 2011
   competition, more effort was focused in the paper review process for the
   2013 competition and standard IEEE peer-review tools and processes were
   used. This document presents in Section III the lessons learned during

Abstract = {{Color science is perhaps the most universally tangible discipline within
   the optical sciences for people of all ages. Excepting a small and
   relatively well-understood minority, we can see that the world around us
   consists of a multitude of colors; yet, describing the ``what{''},
   ``why{''}, and ``how{''} of these colors is not an easy task, especially
   without some sort of equally colorful visual aids. While static displays
   (e.g., poster boards, etc.) serve their purpose, there is a growing
   trend, aided by the recent permeation of small interactive devices into
   our society, for interactive and immersive learning. However, for the
   uninitiated, designing software and hardware for this purpose may not be
   within the purview of all optical scientists and engineers.
   Enter open source. Open source ``anything{''} are those tools and
   designs -- hardware or software -- that are available and free to use,
   often without any restrictive licensing. Open source software may be
   familiar to some, but the open source hardware movement is relatively
   new. These are electronic circuit board designs that are provided for
   free and can be implemented in physical hardware by anyone. This
   movement has led to the availability of some relatively inexpensive, but
   quite capable, computing power for the creation of small devices.
   This paper will showcase the design and implementation of the software
   and hardware that was used to create an interactive demonstration kit
   for color. Its purpose is to introduce and demonstrate the concepts of
   color spectra, additive color, color rendering, and metamers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simple Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based air
   quality monitoring system (WSN-AQMS) for industrial and urban areas. The
   proposed framework comprises a set of gas sensors (ozone, CO, and NO2)
   that are deployed on stacks and infrastructure of a Zigbee WSN and a
   central server to support both short-term real-time incident management
   and a long-term strategic planning. This architecture would use
   open-hardware open-software gas sensing capable motes {[}6] made by
   Libelium. These motes use the ZigBee communication protocol and provide
   a real-time low cost monitoring system through the use of low cost, low
   data rate, and low power wireless communication technology. The proposed
   monitoring system can be transferred to or shared by other applications.
   We also introduce a simple but efficient clustering protocol dubbed
   hereafter ``Clustering Protocol for Air Sensor network{''} (CPAS) for
   the proposed WSN-AQMS framework. CPAS proves to be efficient in terms of
   network energy consumption, network lifetime, and the rate at which data
   is communicated.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter illustrates how to set up an inexpensive but effective
   Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) platform for the test of wind turbine (WT)
   controllers. The dynamics of the WT are simulated on the open-source
   National Renewable Energy Laboratory WT simulator called FAST (Fatigue,
   Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), which emulates all required
   input signals of the controller and reacts to the controller commands
   (almost) like an onshore real turbine of 5 MW. The dynamic torque
   control system runs on an open hardware Arduino microcontroller board,
   which is connected to the virtual WT via USB. In particular, the power
   generation control in the full load region for variable-speed
   variable-pitch wind turbines is considered through torque and pitch
   control. The HIL proposed platform is used to characterize the behavior
   of the WT in normal operation as well as in fault operation. In
   particular, a stuck/unstuck fault is modeled and the behavior of a
   proposed chattering torque controller is analyzed in comparison to a
   baseline torque controller.}},

   mechanisms for collaboration, and complementary facilities. The pilot
   project for this initiative is the Multi-Purpose Avionics Core Element
   (M-PACE). The primary goal of M-PACE is to demonstrate advanced
   manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and Digital
   Materials, to minimize the cost of cube satellites and increase their
   modularity. M-PACE will be designed and built at the NASA Ames'
   SpaceShop, which is a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility
   built for NASA researchers to formulate ideas for projects. The final
   products of M-PACE are several completed side panels of a one-unit (1U)
   (10 cm cube) cube satellite prototype built using commercial
   off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which will show the basic functionality
   of the internal payload by connecting it to the side panels for power
   and other subsystem capabilities. Within the structure, we are
   investigating the use of Digital Materials, which are universal building
   materials with the ability to increase precision and ease of assembly
   and disassembly of three dimensional (3D) objects. M-PACE will use COTS
   power systems and open-source hardware and software to distribute data
   through Ethernet through the use of snap-fit card connectors. Similar to
   Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express cards, we envision the
   spacecraft subsystems and payloads to be on a PC104-like board that will
   slide into the side panel connectors to enable distribution of power and
   data. This design has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of Cube
   Satellite testing and integration due to the absence of wires and ease
   of access to internal boards for any necessary modifications.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming is an issue that keeps coming up recently with the
   increase of temperature and carbon dioxide level. Scientist believes
   that the main cause of this is because of the deforestation, pollution,
   carbon emission from transportation and factories that led to this
   global warming. However, there are also skeptics that believe otherwise.
   To prove the cause of global warming and whether it is an event that
   occurs every now and then as some skeptics and scientists suggested a
   multi sensor device is build, which consist of temperature, humidity,
   carbon dioxide and oxygen. With limited funding and a few different
   location to be tested to prove this phenomena, a low cost device is
   built so that it will be within the budget of this project as well give
   the result that is to determine whether development has cause the global
   warming and forest and absorbing the CO2 emission to keep the world
   cool. Thanks to open source hardware, the sensor system can be build
   economically.}},

   Among others it currently contains detailed descriptions of Willow
   Garage's TurtleBot, the NimbRo-OP created by the University of Bonn and
   the AMIGO robot of Tech United Eindhoven. Eventually, ROP will contain a
   collection of affordable hardware components, allowing researchers to
   focus on cutting-edge research on a particular component instead of
   having to design the entire robot from scratch. As an example of how the
   Robotic Open Platform is able to facilitate this knowledge transfer, we
   introduce TURTLE-5k: A redesign of an existing soccer robot by a
   consortium of our university and companies in the wider Eindhoven area.
   Cooperating with industrial partners resulted in a significant cost

Abstract = {{This paper explains the design of a communication system, using an
   Arduino microcontroller and GSM Module and its functions / associated
   components to be implemented in a microgrid. The microgrid control and
   coordination infrastructure has been realized as a hierarchical
   multi-agent system (MAS) comprising of the DG agents, the Mu agent and
   the D agent. The Communication (Mu) Agent acts as a link between the
   lower-level microgrid agents (distributed energy resources (DERs), the
   load, the storage and the utility grid) which provide the required
   digital parameter inputs, and the Control Agent comprising of the Cloud.
   Data storage, analytics and control commands are generated based on the
   rule engine updates given by the Utility Service Provider (USP) to the
   Cloud. The microgrid side input data are converted into appropriate GPRS
   signals within the Arduino. The specific functions that enable this
   conversion are elucidated as pseudocode. Further, the cloud control
   commands are sent back to the various microgrid-side agents via the Mu
   agent as GPRS signals. The communication strategy has been explained in
   detail and has been implemented using Arduino keeping in mind system
   costs, ease of operability and maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{The Abbey of Santa Maria extra moenia is a historical complex located in
   the Marche region (Italy). It has undergone substantial transformations
   over the centuries. For this reason, the historical and critical
   interpretation requires a key capable of simplifying the understanding
   of all the modifications.
   Starting from both an archival study and an architectural survey, we
   created different 3D models to help analyze and understand all the
   historical and architectural phases of the complex. The 3D-model
   reconstructions are based on metric and land surveys. The survey
   permitted us to identify seven main historical phases. In this way
   knowledge of the abbey becomes an elaborate history that needs an
   appropriate dissemination tool. The abbey is now abandoned due to its
   poor state and no action has been taken for its improvement or
   preservation. A first step in raising awareness of this forgotten
   cultural object is to foster better knowledge of its history through a
   new visual interface that is able to clarify all the events that have
   occurred over time. In order to explain the complex history of the
   abbey, we tested a new approach based on the use of a mock-up as a
   physical interface allowing access to different digital content. For
   this purpose we used open-source hardware: an Arduino-based
   microcontroller, named Makey Makey, connected to different parts of the
   mock-up through wired buttons. In this way, the computer processes the
   signal coming from the buttons using the mock-up like a keyboard to
   manage all the information related to the abbey.}},

   year. The course includes topics in software design patterns,
   multi-threaded applications, rudimentary user-interface design, embedded
   programming including sensor building and processing, and Zigbee-based
   wireless communications. The course is 2 semester credits (1-2-3), and
   includes a comprehensive project that requires students to build a
   tangible game or a game-like entertainment system. One key component of
   the course is the use of an open-source hardware platform called
   Arduino. The results are that students enjoy the course and are able to
   build integrated systems that incorporate design patterns,
   multi-threading, embedded programming and wireless communication in an

Abstract = {{The data centre at the Galician Institute of High Energy Physics (IGFAE)
   of the Santiago de Compostela University (USC) is a computing cluster
   with about 150 nodes and 1250 cores that hosts the LHCb Tiers 2 and 3.
   In this small data centre, and of course in similar or bigger ones, it
   is very important to keep optimal conditions of temperature, humidity
   and pressure. Therefore, it is a necessity to monitor the environment
   and be able to trigger alarms when operating outside the recommended
   settings.
   There are currently many tools and systems developed for data centre
   monitoring, but until recent years all of them were of commercial nature
   and expensive. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in
   the use of technologies based on Arduino due to its open hardware
   licensing and the low cost of this type of components. In this article
   we describe the system developed to monitor IGFAE's data centre, which
   integrates an Arduino controlled sensor network with the Nagios
   monitoring software. Sensors of several types, temperature, humidity and
   pressure, are connected to the Arduino board. The Nagios software is in
   charge of monitoring the various sensors and, with the help of
   Nagiosgraph, to keep track of the historic data and to produce the
   plots. An Arduino program, developed in house, provides the Nagios
   plugin with the readout of one or several sensors depending on the
   plugin's request. The Nagios plugin for reading the temperature sensors
   also broadcasts an SNMP trap when the temperature gets out of the
   allowed operating range.}},

Abstract = {{The developing world remains plagued by lack of access to safe drinking

   necessary to determine if these appropriate technologies are needed,
   effective, and reliable. This paper provides a methodology for the
   design, development, and technical validation of a low-cost, open-source
   (OS) water testing platform. A case study is presented where the
   platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical
   oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure
   turbidity using method ISO 7027. This approach resulted in equipment
   that is as accurate, but costs between 7.5 and 15 times less than
   current commercially available tools. It is concluded that OS hardware
   development is a promising solution for the equipment necessary to
   perform water quality measurements in both developed and developing

Pages = {{4652-4660}},
Abstract = {{Gas chromatography (GC) is frequently used in qualitative and
   quantitative analysis of volatile organic molecules. In its most common
   embodiment, samples are prepared in the laboratory, and injected into
   the capillary column using an autosampler. Analytes are separated, and
   detected by one of several available detection systems, including mass
   spectrometry (MS). However, this mode of operation is not convenient
   when monitoring dynamic chemical systems - for example, reaction
   mixtures. Here we present a facile approach for automated sampling, and
   subsequent introduction of samples to a GC apparatus in order to enable
   monitoring of dynamic chemical processes in real time. The proposed
   system incorporates two pinch valves, a peristaltic pump, a
   thermoshaker, and an electronic control unit (Raspberry Pi
   microcomputer) with several relays. The device facilitates dosing small
   volumes of liquid samples to the injection port of a commercial GC-MS
   apparatus. A program in C language controls the operation of the pump
   (on/off, direction of flow) and actuation of the pinch valves, and it
   initiates GC-MS runs. The system has been characterised with artificial
   samples, and successfully used in the monitoring of transesterification
   reactions catalysed by single microbeads containing immobilised lipase,
   as well as in the monitoring of the extraction of natural products from
   plant tissue samples. We believe that - following further improvements -
   this automated approach may be adapted for monitoring industrial
   processes and environmental analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In the open hardware graphics accelerator (ORGFX), there are rectangle,
   line, triangle and curve rasterization modules. This paper is only
   focused on the improvement of line rasterization speed. Besides
   modifying the algorithm itself, hardware implementation and resource
   consumption are put into consideration here. Originally, ORGFX uses the
   classic Bresenham line algorithm with high precision and simple logic to
   rasterize lines, but this algorithm can only generate one pixel in each
   rasterization process, which results in efficiency relatively low. New
   algorithm in this paper combines Bresenham algorithm with the symmetry
   nature of lines, advantages of Bresenham algorithm are kept and
   rasterization speed is improved in this way. The results of experiments
   show that nearly 50 percent of time can be saved through software
   implementation and hardware implementation.}},

   desire to consider the morphology as an experimental variable on real
   robotic platforms as well as allowing reproducibility and diffusion in
   the scientific community. In this context, we present an alternative
   design and production methodology that we have applied to the conception
   of Poppy, the first complete 3D printed open-source and open-hardware
   humanoid robot. Robust and accessible, it allows exploring quickly and
   easily the fabrication, the programming and the experimentation of
   various robotic morphologies. Both hardware and software are
   open-source, and a web platform allows interdisciplinary contributions,
   sharing and collaborations. Finally we conduct an experiment to explore
   the impact of four different foot morphologies on the robot's dynamic
   when it makes a footstep. We show that such experimentation can easily
   be achieved and shared in couple of days at almost no cost.}},

   cost was a problem, democratizing the innovation process. This paper
   presents an open hardware and software platform developed for power

Abstract = {{The prime objective of any technological innovation is to improve the
   life of people. Technological innovation in the field of medical devices
   directly touches the lives of millions of people; not just patients but
   doctors and other technicians as well. Serving these care givers is
   serving humanity. Growth of Mobil Devices and Cloud Computing has
   changed the way we live and work. We try to bring the benefits of these
   technological innovations to the medical field via equipment which can
   improve the working efficiencies and capabilities of the medical
   professionals and technicians. The improvements in the camera and image
   processing capabilities of the Mobile Devices coupled with their
   improved processing power and an infinite processing and storage offered
   by Cloud Computing infrastructure opens up a window of opportunity to
   use them in the specialized field like microsurgery. To enable
   microsurgery, surgeons use optical microscope to zoom into the working
   area to get better visibility and control. However, these devices suffer
   from various drawbacks and are not comfortable to use. We build a Tablet
   with large stereoscopic screen allowing glasses free 3D display enabled
   by cameras capable of capturing 3D video and enhanced by an image
   processing pipeline, greatly improves the visibility and viewing comfort
   of the surgeon. Moreover using the capabilities of Cloud computing,
   these surgeries can be recorded and streamed live for education,
   training and consultation. An expert sitting in a geographically remote
   location can guide the surgeon performing the surgery. All vital
   parameters of the patient undergoing surgery can be shown as an overlay
   on the Tablet screen so that the surgeon is alerted of any parameter
   going beyond limit. Developing this kind of complex device involves
   engineering skills in hardware and software and huge amount of
   investments in terms of time, resources and money. To accelerate the
   development, we make use of open source hardware and software and
   demonstrate how we can accelerate the development using these open
   source resources.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid advancement of low cost embedded systems invites engineering
   educators to deliver content and skills while engaging students in
   hands-on projects that may potentially make use of a variety of
   platforms. From proprietary to open source hardware and software, from
   microcontrollers to embedded operating systems (OS) devices, students
   today are challenged to accelerate their learning pace by working on
   real-world projects in a supervised environment. Currently, students
   rely on self-guidance in order to develop the knowledge base necessary
   for achieving the goals of their team projects with respect to embedded
   systems. This paper presents the results of an embedded systems
   programming tutorial piloted with a group of 15 undergraduate students
   from across the engineering disciplines and with a mix of sophomores
   through seniors. The tutorial included a series of three lecture modules
   prepared to introduce concepts on embedded systems. The modules were
   tightly coupled with hands-on exercises that employed the DE2i-150
   development board, aimed to introduce students to the development of
   digital systems based on an Altera field programmable gate array (FPGA)
   in conjunction with an Linux-based embedded OS running on an Intel Atom
   processor. The first module provides an overview of the various inputs,
   outputs, sensors, and displays of the board. The second module
   introduces the embedded OS and guides students in establishing a
   high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) link between
   the Atom processor and the FPGA. The third module focuses on
   implementing a custom C/++ application written by students for real-time
   processing of inputs from four push buttons. Results show that the three
   lecture modules of 30 minutes each, coupled with the hands-on projects,
   offer a good introduction to the complexity of the DE2i-150 board.
   Surveys collected before the first module and after the third show a
   generally positive outcome. Recommendations for future efforts focus on
   incorporating more complex C/++ applications concurrent with FPGA
   development.}},

Abstract = {{In teaching undergraduate automatic controls, the laboratory experience
   is an important and irreplaceable component. Historically, good
   platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the
   equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes.
   Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of
   student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in
   maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller
   hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to
   have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The
   Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and
   LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing
   laboratory procedures for students to study controls.
   The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
   flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. The ``motor shield{''} is
   an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of
   dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an
   Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink
   provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller
   design. The Arduino board is powered by, and communicates with Simulink,
   through a standard USB connection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explains the implementation of a low cost, non-intrusive home
   energy monitoring system. The design implementation of the proof of
   concept employs open-source hardware architecture using Arduino and
   off-the-shelf sensors which lends itself to mass production, low cost
   and easy maintenance. This system is intended to service rural and low
   income urban consumers who will not be able to afford existing
   sophisticated and expensive home automation systems. A device
   identification module (DIM) that recognizes the devices in use at every
   room is implemented. The energy usage is continuously monitored and the
   user is notified of his consumption over a twenty four hour period. As
   many of the intended users are possible first time energy consumers, the
   energy monitoring system will inculcate a sense of energy consciousness
   and ensure grass root level sustainability. The energy consumption data
   is logged in the system and can be used by the utility service provider
   (USP) for future system planning, optimization and demand side
   management. The proof of concept developed and tested under laboratory
   conditions costs under USD 11 and will reduce further on
   commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology proposal and hands-on activities
   in the Introduction to Computer Engineering (ICE) course, based on open
   hardware platforms. The proposal has been adopted in the Computer
   Engineering undergraduate program at the Federal University of Mato
   Grosso do Sul (UFMS) - Brazil. Most of the ICE courses from computer
   engineering programs around the world have put focus on teaching initial
   basic theoretical concepts of algorithms, logic, and digital systems.
   The ICE course at UFMS has been organized to encompass from initial
   basic concepts up to a practical and motivating set of experimental
   activities in order to clarify the program focus and to connect the
   concepts to practical applications. To evaluate the impacts of this new
   curriculum and methodology, an online anonymous survey has been carried
   out with students from 2011, 2012, and 2013 classes. After a statistical
   analysis and validation of the answers, 28\% of the students have
   pointed that the activities have been determinant to increase their
   motivation to study computer engineering. The impacts on students
   motivation, since the first semester, have been observed in the students
   evasion rate. The percentage of evasions in the computer engineering is
   less than other engineering programs at UFMS.}},

   of National Education. Then, a project for designing an irrigation
   system for the school orchard is presented, which will engage students
   to develop the selected technological competencies. Subsequently, a set
   of didactic tools for the project are presented, including an electronic
   platform for the control of the water flux in the irrigation system. The
   project will be implemented during the following months, and through
   diagnostic and summative assessment it is expected to measure the

Abstract = {{This paper presents the state-of-the-art for building a low cost mobile
   robot with open-source technology based on sensor fusion. Designing
   open-source educational robots has a great impact on empowering
   engineers and those interested in mobile robots. In the last decade,
   different robots have been designed and built for this purpose. In this
   project, with the help of sensors available on a 9-axis open-source IMU
   and a robot based on open-source hardware and control software, a
   graphical user interface has been implemented to view the condition of
   motion variables in a real-time manner and combine sensor data.
   Moreover, by implementing different filter programs, such as low-pass
   filter, complementary filter and by using KF implementation and
   deliberation this mobile robot becomes suitable for improving the
   accuracy of the robot in extracting parameters required for
   localization, mapping and robot navigation. Features of the developed
   robot, the so-called TL-OSR, can be regarded as: using open-source
   hardware and software with real-time performance, low price equipment,
   presenting a solution based on sensor fusion for better accuracy in
   robot navigation and using different types of sensors. This robot can be
   used as an suitable open-source platform as a new class of mobile robots

   platform that is accuracy, repeatable and scalable. The complete
   features of OAI emulation platform are presented and the key
   technologies are introduced. In order to develop the platform for the
   further application, some new modules have been added and some
   validation of the platform has been provided. The emulation comes in two
   flavors: single machine mode and multi-machine mode. PHY abstraction
   with the core methodology of effective SINR mapping improves the
   platform's efficiency and the capability to build a large-scale
   emulation with multiple nodes. The key function random access and
   scheduling of MAC layer and the basic call procedure of the platform are
   provided. The validation results shown in this paper illustrate that the
   emulation platform is correctly operating and PHY abstraction reduce the
   emulation time significantly on the basis of accuracy. This emulation
   platform can be used to test, evaluate and validate of the real LTE
   system, and with the efficiency operation, it can be improved to support
   the system-level emulation of a large-scale LTE and LTE-A system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and implementation of an OpenRISC-based
   System-on-Chip (SoC), which is composed of hardware cores implementing
   the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functions: Finite Impulse Response
   (FIR) filter, Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter and Fast Fourier
   Transform (FFT). The FIR-filter core is based on the transpose
   realization form, the IIR-filter core is based on the Second Order
   Sections (SOS) architecture and the FFT core is based on the Radix 2(2)
   Single Delay Feedback (R2(2) SDF) architecture. The three cores are
   compatible with the Wishbone SoC bus, and they were described using
   generic and structural VHDL. In-system hardware verification was
   performed by using an OpenRisc-based SoC synthesized on an Altera FPGA.
   Tests showed that the designed DSP cores are suitable for building SoC
   based on the OpenRisc processor and the Wishbone bus.}},

Abstract = {{We have detected a great gap between teaching of structural mechanics
   and the real world applications related with this subject. The European
   Space of Higher Education requires a higher proportion of practical
   content in courses, so that students can develop skills to solve real
   problems in the development of their professional practice. Therefore,
   we have the challenge of develop new laboratory practices to reduce the
   gap between theoretical contents of the classes and the aforementioned
   real world applications.
   When we faced with this problem, we realized that usual commercial
   equipments for educational laboratories are quite limited in flexibility
   and are often quite expensive. In this work we show how we have
   implemented the practices for a structural mechanics course in the
   second year of civil engineering studies using open hardware solutions.
   For this purpose we built our own devices and involved students from
   different courses and specialties, including undergraduate researchers
   in the development of the different mechanical and electronic
   components. The main aim of the present work has been the creation of a
   self-teaching experience for students, where they can freely build the
   models, interact with the sensors and check the correlation between the
   theoretical models and the practical results.}},

Abstract = {{Robotics teaching is nowadays limited by the expensiveness of the
   electronic material required. In this paper, a new low-cost, user
   friendly robotic system has been developed. This system provides an
   advanced mobile robotics teaching frame using cheap hardware and
   software resources. This platform consists on a little mobile robot able
   to navigate through the environment avoiding obstacles and performing a
   map of its surrounding. This system performs these tasks using open
   hardware and software tools. The robot, made from an Arduino board,
   cheap sensors, motors and wheels, has been programmed using C++ language
   on Arduino and ROS. The system communicates in real time with a PC where
   the map is drawn using OpenCV libraries.
   Regarding to the hardware, the robot has the structure of a PopBot-168
   Arduino kit, which consists of a circular structure and two motors
   connected to their corresponding wheels. The robot also has two encoders
   and a magnetometer to perform location task. The processor is an Arduino
   Mega board. The system features two infrared sensors that get the
   distances of robot's environment in every directions due to a servomotor
   that moves them.
   The developed robot is able to perform a map of its environment and draw
   it in a computer. The communication between the robot and the computer
   is performed using ROS. This project has managed to introduce a ROS node
   on the Arduino board. In the computer there are another two nodes, one
   for draw the map and another which decide where to move.
   Finally, as experimental results, an example of how the robot works
   building a 2-dimensional reconstruction from an environment is shown.
   Students can learn about the problem of auto-location and other
   difficulties due to robotics itself. It is also a very good mechanism to
   learn from the beginning to design, assemble and program a mobile robot;
   use and gather data from the sensors.}},

Abstract = {{``Music education is, in its nature, human and essentially serves to
   awaken and develop human capacities.{''} This phrase by Edgar Willems
   (1890-1978) serves as a starting point in the design, implementation,
   tuning and validation of a digital interface for teaching and musical
   creation with children from 3 years old, visually impaired or affected
   by Autism Spectrum Disorders. The values of illustrated society advocate
   the access to knowledge for people on equal conditions. Our own public
   and private education system is based on the merit declaring the
   equality of citizens. The main aim of our technological proposal is to
   demonstrate in the practice that the inclusion of students with visual
   impairment or autism spectrum disorders in the music room, both in
   schools and conservatories, is positively feasible through curricular
   changes and using some resources that optimize the inclusion. And in
   this process, the teacher is a fundamental key part of the educational
   inclusion. Teachers should have the tools, based on traditional and new
   technologies, which will help them facilitate and enhance and improve
   their task results. The design and operation of the interface, which
   allows the generation and combination of sounds in real time according
   to the movements made by the student, is based on an open hardware
   platform and on an open software development environment. These ensure,
   from the beginning, a cheap interface and make it available to the
   educational community a tool that could use and improve, if deemed, its
   performance according to their own needs.}},

   paper, we describe the design and delivery of a training workshop that
   was developed for academics with Information Technology background; the
   key objective of this workshop's training, was to introduce them to
   concepts related to physical computing and spark their interest in
   broadening the scope of computing background for them and their
   students. The workshop features the Arduino UNO micro-controller since
   it is a cross platform, open source, and open hardware. Also, due to the
   fact it's low-cost, flexibility, and simplicity. The sessions covered
   topics of how to build a circuit, program an Arduino, demonstrate the
   (IC)-C-2 protocol and establish a serial communication. Twenty-two
   participants took part in the workshop sessions and two instructors were
   involved in running the sessions. Insights obtained from conducting the
   sessions and feedback from participants are synthesized and discussed.
   Implications for training related to introducing physical computing to

Abstract = {{This paper details the implementation of a low-cost, open hardware,
   cloud-based intelligent farm automation system. Physical parameters such
   as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing
   sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is
   transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors
   using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time
   intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from
   the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The
   novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence
   provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually
   obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command
   generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the
   existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the
   cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation
   time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and
   energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system
   elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail
   price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further
   reduce on mass production and commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-cost open source prototype of a gesture
   recognition and interpretation glove that aids audio-vocally impaired
   individuals in communication. A sensor based glove for recognition of
   the gestures in the American Sign Language (ASL) is the input module to
   the system. It incorporates resistive flex sensors and contact sensors
   appropriately positioned to obtain a theoretical efficiency of 96\% in
   character recognition. When the sensors are subjected to change in
   orientation by the user, the variation in electrical resistance of each
   of the individual sensors is obtained as the input to an Arduino
   ATMega328 microcontroller that accurately maps it to the letters of the
   English alphabet through an efficient algorithm. An elegant methodology
   that is easy to implement using a microcontroller is employed for the
   mapping process to minimize the complexity of the system. The paper also
   presents a detailed study of the efficiency characteristics involved in
   the construction of the custom-designed flex sensors utilized in the
   system. The paper outlines the calibration and testing results of the
   sensors. The highlights of the system are its ergonomic and economical
   design, portability and intelligent gesture recognition and
   interpretation ability. The implemented system achieves a practical
   efficiency of up to 80\% of theoretical efficiency. The cost of the
   system is approximately less than USD 5 at laboratory condition using
   off the shelf components.}},

Title = {{BeamMaker: an open hardware high-resolution digital fabricator for the
   masses}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for
   the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of
   production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this
   goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential
   to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of
   personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a
   reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the
   open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the
   development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these
   points.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed
   a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer
   is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing
   projector. This work details the design process and how improvements
   were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide
   public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list,
   user manual and STL and CAD files.
   Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface
   quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial
   photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a
   sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to
   other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering
   the low cost of the system.
   Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the
   system has not been measured to date. The system requires some
   improvements to produce large objects.
   Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five
   to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers
   available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal
   photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet
   producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues
   for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving
   these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal
   3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into
   the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as
   that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization
   of personal fabrication.
   Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other
   photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the
   authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D
   printer project which uses this technology.}},

Abstract = {{Since its inception in 19th-century Germany, the physiology laboratory
   has been a complex and expensive research enterprise involving experts
   in various fields of science and engineering. Physiology research has

   Evolution of modern experimental equipment is constrained by lack of
   direct communication between the physiological community and industry
   producing this equipment. Fortunately, recent advances in open source
   technologies, including three-dimensional printing, open source hardware
   and software, present an exciting opportunity to bring the design and

Abstract = {{With the recent development of the RepRap, an open-source
   self-replicating rapid prototyper, low-cost three-dimensional (3D)
   printing is now a technically viable form of distributed manufacturing
   of polymer-based products. However, the aggregate environmental benefits
   of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and
   the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the
   environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a
   life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The
   embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production
   in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental
   measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power
   fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and
   polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy
   demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64\%
   (55-74\% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed
   manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using
   <25\% fill PIA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are
   observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed
   and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed
   manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a
   lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety
   of products.}},

Abstract = {{Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to
   monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in
   large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures.
   High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and
   efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage
   of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and,
   through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management
   inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and
   eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open
   source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print
   management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of
   integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small
   number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are
   none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This
   paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the
   provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in
   order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business
   process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary
   automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any
   human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print
   accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools
   necessary for production installations.}},

Abstract = {{With embedded systems becoming ubiquitous, there is a growing need to
   teach and train engineers to be well-versed in their design and
   development. The multidisciplinary nature of such systems makes it
   challenging to give students exposure to and experience in all their
   facets. This paper proposes a generic architecture, containing multiple
   processors, that allows easy integration of custom and/or predefined
   peripherals. The architecture allows students to explore both the
   hardware and software issues associated with real-time and embedded
   systems. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended to train students
   in advanced concepts in embedded multiprocessor systems. This generic
   architecture has been used for two courses at the National University of
   Singapore-one on real-time embedded systems and the other emphasizing
   the hardware aspects of embedded systems. The project in the real-time
   embedded systems course has students develop a five-a-side soccer system
   on multiple field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards using embedded
   processors. In the embedded hardware design course project, students use
   an embedded processor-based system to perform decryption of a block
   encrypted image, accelerated through a custom co-processor. The use of
   displays gives students a visual/interactive experience and a sense of
   accomplishment, while reinforcing the theoretical concepts. Both
   qualitative and quantitative assessment results are presented, showing
   how students perceived these projects and met the learning objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The ASDEX Upgrade tokamak went into operation in 1991 with a proposed
   lifetime of 10 years. Due to major modifications ASDEX Upgrade is still
   in operation. Infrastructure like data acquisition, workstations, etc.
   is being modernized, interfaces like RS-232 are vanishing and new
   interfaces are being introduced. This leads to the necessity to adapt
   old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do
   not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A
   simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware
   microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit
   RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with
   a large number of libraries. In this paper the use of Arduino boards for
   replacing the position unit, the stub tuner interface and its use
   controlling a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with phase control
   capability are shown. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An outstanding issue in graph-theoretical studies of brain functional
   connectivity is the lack of formal criteria for choosing parcellation
   granularity and correlation threshold. Here, we propose detectability of
   scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction
   settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node
   connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly
   conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest
   within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate
   that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine
   cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation
   threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware
   platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression
   arrays. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with

Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of
   distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects
   technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread
   proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These
   self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture
   approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition
   of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional
   prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and
   appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable
   development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like
   2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a
   typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic
   analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new
   low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to
   construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20
   open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02\% of those
   available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are
   quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared
   to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without
   shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely
   conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to
   make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings
   would range from about \$300 to \$2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of
   necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed
   throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the
   RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200\% and
   >40\%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear
   out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the
   distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the
   unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an
   economically attractive investment for the average US household already.
   It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to
   decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source
   designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will
   become a mass-market mechatronic device. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A Handheld Point-of-Care Genomic Diagnostic System}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The rapid detection and identification of infectious disease pathogens
   is a critical need for healthcare in both developed and developing
   countries. As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen
   infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will
   likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we
   present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to
   enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic
   Biomolecular Amplification Reader (mBAR) represents the convergence of
   molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology.
   The mBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid
   amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction
   of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the
   mBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging
   which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare
   delivery. The mBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated
   resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60
   individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are
   carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no
   external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence
   detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument.
   As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1
   integrase gene with the mBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal
   Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of
   purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of
   clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic
   device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The
   mBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in
   the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics,
   bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the
   mBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward
   low-cost genetic diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{The tensile modulus of articular cartilage is much larger than its
   compressive modulus. This tension compression nonlinearity enhances
   interstitial fluid pressurization and decreases the frictional
   coefficient. The current set of studies examines the tensile and
   compressive properties of cylindrical chondrocyte-seeded agarose
   constructs over different developmental stages through a novel method
   that combines osmotic loading, video microscopy, and uniaxial unconfined
   compression testing. This method was previously used to examine
   tension-compression nonlinearity in native cartilage. Engineered
   cartilage, cultured under free-swelling (FS) or dynamically loaded (DL)
   conditions, was tested in unconfined compression in hypertonic and
   hypotonic salt solutions. The apparent equilibrium modulus decreased
   with increasing salt concentration, indicating that increasing the bath
   solution osmolarity shielded the fixed charges within the tissue,
   shifting the measured moduli along the tension-compression curve and
   revealing the intrinsic properties of the tissue. With this method, we
   were able to measure the tensile (401 +/- 83 kPa for FS and 678 +/- 473
   kPa for DL) and compressive (161 +/- 33 kPa for FS and 348 +/- 203 kPa
   for DL) moduli of the same engineered cartilage specimens. These moduli
   are comparable to values obtained from traditional methods, validating
   this technique for measuring the tensile and compressive properties of
   hydrogel-based constructs. This study shows that engineered cartilage
   exhibits tension-compression nonlinearity reminiscent of the native
   tissue, and that dynamic deformational loading can yield significantly
   higher tensile properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   It is primarily designed to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere

Abstract = {{For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source
   community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS,
   or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this
   trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical
   developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good
   example of a successful hardware project with a great community of
   developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers
   is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical
   things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to
   take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object
   Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical
   components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these
   emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and
   modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling
   things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and
   (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as
   geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined,
   fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it.
   Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural
   analysis, etc.}},

Abstract = {{OpenPMU is an open platform for the development of phasor measurement
   unit (PMU) technology. A need has been identified for an open-source
   alternative to commercial PMU devices tailored to the needs of the
   university researcher and for enabling the development of new
   synchrophasor instruments from this foundation. OpenPMU achieves this
   through open-source hardware design specifications and software source
   code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under
   open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on
   the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested
   according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE
   C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is
   readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements
   have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility. A new
   modularized architecture for the OpenPMU is presented using an open
   messaging format which the authors propose is adopted as a platform for
   PMU research.}},

Abstract = {{The high cost of what have historically been sophisticated
   research-related sensors and tools has limited their adoption to a
   relatively small group of well-funded researchers. This paper provides a
   methodology for applying an open-source approach to design and
   development of a colorimeter. A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter
   utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily
   available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared
   to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with
   commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux
   COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the
   vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter
   demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further
   development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes
   such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to
   sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in
   need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories.}},

Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Just as the power of the open-source design paradigm has driven down the
   cost of software to the point that it is accessible to most People, the
   rise of open-source hardware is Poised to drive down the cost of doing
   experimental science to expand access to everyone. To assist in this
   aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics
   components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain
   tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware.
   First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source
   computer aided design package is described to customize the optics
   hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of
   open-source 3 D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the
   primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct
   complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source
   electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical
   experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical
   library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much
   optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted
   customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97\%, with
   some components representing only 1\% of the current commercial
   investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this
   study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development
   enables a much broader audience to participate in optical
   experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous
   proprietary methods.}},

Title = {{The FireFader: Simple, Open-Source, and Reconfigurable Haptic Force
   Feedback for Musicians}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER MUSIC JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-34}},

Abstract = {{The FireFader is a simple haptic force-feedback device that is optimized
   for introducing musicians to haptics. It is based upon a
   single-degree-of-freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also
   known as a ``motorized fader.{''} A light is connected in parallel with
   the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The
   FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software
   elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it
   into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and
   sensors.
   An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to
   a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control
   calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a
   virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and
   calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The
   serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal
   compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection
   facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback
   can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader.
   Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented.}},

Abstract = {{THE LIFE CYCLE OF A RADIOSONDE The development of scientific instruments
   Was, only a few years ago, confined to universities and electronics
   companies having highly specialized human and/or technical resources.
   With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists,
   hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able
   to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these
   inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an
   engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about
   building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an
   open hardware platform and easily accessible components.
   As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures,
   records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a
   small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was
   also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon
   upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it
   is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the
   help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale
   forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the
   sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate
   chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the
   more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1)
   collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both
   education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware
   platform that allows for an effective way to compare different
   commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype
   sensors. (Page 187)}},

Abstract = {{Since its introduction in 1992, Global System for Mobile Communications
   (GSM) has evolved to become a worldwide standard in mobile telephony.
   Security in GSM, albeit being one of the most important issues, has not
   yet been scrutinized to a level it deserves owing mainly to the
   expensive hardware requirements and lack of thorough understanding of
   GSM protocols in general. This scenario is changing significantly with
   the growing rate of development of open-source tools, which can serve to
   harness the RF signaling and enable processing on a general purpose
   workstation. In this paper, these open-source tools are utilized to
   study the feasibility of developing a GSM Protocol Analyzer and
   investigating the theoretical security protocols and procedures through
   practical implementation of such system. Universal Software Programmable
   Radio Peripheral (USRP) was selected as the RF frontend for the protocol
   analyzer. The USRP is a general purpose, open-hardware transceiver that
   can be linked to a workstation via an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet link.
   Various open-source software, based primarily on GNU Radio, are then
   utilized to synchronize, demodulate and decode the received signal.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical simulation based design error debug approaches strongly rely
   on quality of the diagnostic test. At the same time there exists no
   dedicated technique to perform its quality assessment and engineers are
   forced to rely on subjective figures such as verification test quality
   metrics or just the size of the diagnostic test. This paper has proposed
   two new approaches for assessing diagnostic capability of diagnostic
   tests for automated bug localization. The first approach relies on
   probabilistic simulation of diagnostic experiments. The second
   assessment method is based on calculating Hamming distances of the
   individual sub-tests in the diagnostic test set. The methods are
   computationally cheap and they provide for a measure of confidence in
   the localization results and allow estimating impact of the diagnostic
   test enhancement. The approach is implemented as a part of an
   open-source hardware design and debugging framework zamiaCAD.
   Experimental results with an industrial processor design and a set of
   documented bugs demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the design and installation of a spectrometer system for
   monitoring solar radiation in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Both the light
   intensity and the spectral distribution affect the power produced by a
   photovoltaic device. Local variations in the solar spectrum (especially
   compared to the AM1.5 standard) may have important implications for
   device optimization and energy yield estimation.
   The spectrometer system, based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 (300-900nm)
   spectrometer, was designed to increase functionality. Typically systems
   only record the global horizontal radiation. Our system moves a
   fiber-optic cable 0-90 degrees and takes measurements in 9 degree
   increments. Additionally, a shadow band allows measurement of the
   diffuse component of the radiation at each position. The electronic
   controls utilize an Arduino UNO microcontroller to synchronizes the
   movement of two PAP bipolar (stepper) motors with the activation of the
   spectrometer via an external trigger. The spectrometer was factory
   calibrated for wavelength and calibrated for absolute irradiance using a
   Sellarnet SL 1-Cal light source.
   We present preliminary results from data taken March-June, 2013, and
   comment on implications for PV devices in Cochabamba.}},

   voltage regulators, IMU boards and GPS receivers to Kalman filtering
   code), the project includes an ever-expanding array of ground hardware
   and software including modems, antennas and a user-friendly ground
   control software interface with a simulation environment. The airborne
   software supports several microprocessor architectures and various
   hardware configurations. All hardware and software is open-source and
   freely available to anyone under the GNU licensing agreement. Currently,
   the Paparazzi project is developed mainly at ENAC University (Ecole
   Nationale de l'Aviation Civile) and the TU-Delft, but significant amount
   of work done by various open-source enthusiasts. The system has been
   used on dozens of airframes and implemented by several teams around the

Abstract = {{Ethernet is widely recognized as an attractive networking technology for
   modern distributed real-time systems. However, standard Ethernet
   components require specific modifications and hardware support to
   provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical
   applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of
   hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly
   unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting
   prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation
   of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications.
   This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on
   reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in
   multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for
   time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly
   integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort
   traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication
   latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices
   for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new
   protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to
   verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to
   accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based
   solutions in real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{The field of wireless communication has become the hottest area and
   Software Defined Radio (SDR) is revolutionizing it. By bringing much
   functionality as software, SDR reduces the cost of hardware maintenance
   and up-gradation. Open source hardware such as USRP (Universal Software
   Radio Peripheral) and software called GNU Radio-Companion are commonly
   used to do experiments in SDR. Since the cost of USRP is high, a low
   cost set up is needed which is affordable by the student community. In
   this paper a low cost alternative to USRP is proposed using RTL-SDR
   (Realtek Software Defined Radio) which is only used for reception. For
   transmitting purpose, a mixer circuit can be used to map the baseband
   signal to the band that can be received by RTL-SDR on the other end on
   Linux / Windows platform. Initially, the experiment is done in
   simulation. After that, it is tested with low cost hardware such as
   mixer and RTL-SDR. The cost for total transceiver system can be less
   than USD 100 which is 10 times less than the existing one.}},

Abstract = {{3DP (Three Dimensional Printing) technology is one of the SFF (Solid
   Freeform Fabrication) technologies which have recently come into the
   spotlight due to its adaptability to various applications. However,
   commercial 3DP machines are limited as to the use of building material,
   without voiding the warranty on the machine.
   At the same time, a rise in domestic rapid prototyping machines is
   observed, but none of these machines use the 3DP process. Therefore, an
   open source 3DP machine is designed and built. In this study, the
   machine is discussed and the first experiments are carried out to create
   ceramic (alumina and zirconia) membranes with specific physical
   properties.
   The purpose for developing this machine was opening up the opportunity
   to investigate printing ceramic membranes and reactors. Were, contrary
   to many other applications, maximal compaction of the powder during
   deposition is not desirable, to maintain an open structure the walls of
   the printed object. The machine is able to deposit the powder with
   adjustable bulk density, which is used to alter the properties of the
   membrane. The design of the printer (drawings, electronic layout,
   software) is publicly released under an open source license, free for
   others to adapt, build and use, e.g. in academic research. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Robust velocity and position estimation at high update rates is crucial
   for mobile robot navigation. In recent years optical flow sensors based
   on computer mouse hardware chips have been shown to perform well on
   micro air vehicles. Since they require more light than present in
   typical indoor and outdoor low-light conditions, their practical use is
   limited. We present an open source and open hardware design (1) of an
   optical flow sensor based on a machine vision CMOS image sensor for
   indoor and outdoor applications with very high light sensitivity.
   Optical flow is estimated on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in
   real-time at 250 Hz update rate. Angular rate compensation with a
   gyroscope and distance scaling using a ultrasonic sensor are performed
   onboard. The system is designed for further extension and adaption and
   shown in-flight on a micro air vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust velocity estimation algorithm applicable to
   low-cost monocular platform with a tri-axial gyroscope. The algorithm is
   developed based on PX4FLOW platform which is an open software and open
   hardware solution for monocular speed estimation. The paper provides
   three main contributions. The first is the improved robustness achieved
   by various methods including feature block selection, feed-forward
   rotation, motion compensation, failure case detection and filtering. The
   second contribution is the improved performance in terms of resolution
   and search range achieved by adaptive frame interval and advanced search
   algorithm. The final contribution is a systematical strategy for
   parameter selection to fully utilize the hardware resources and optimize
   the performance in different contexts. The performance was benchmarked
   against the PX4FLOW and GPS. Results indicated that the proposed
   algorithm achieved levels of robustness exceeding that of PX4FLOW in
   measuring velocity. Also, the integrated trajectory agreed with the
   position calculated by an on-board GPS system.}},

Abstract = {{Access to a prototype during R\&D can play a crucial role in early
   identification of the weaknesses in the design. Under circumstances that
   a particular commercial subsystem with the exact required specific
   features is unavailable, the realization of such a prototype can be
   delayed. In this paper, an example of rapid prototyping for a
   dual-channel biosignal data acquisition system based on the open-source
   concept is described. The selected biosignal is the finger
   photoplethysmogram. Except for Matlab, all other software components are
   open-source. The hardware design of the optical sensor utilized to
   record the signals is also open-source, making the system extremely
   affordable with the advantage of flexibility and customization. Precise
   timing of the samples allows for proper alignment and delay estimation
   between the acquired traces, useful in arterial stiffness studies.
   Although the results presented concern only two channels, the system has
   the ability to be expanded to six channels. Further possible expansions
   include the addition of custom filtering, on-board data compression and
   advanced GUI.}},

   power meters with new smart meters. These digital power meters have
   enhanced communication capabilities, but they are not actually smart. We
   present the cognitive power meter (c-meter), a meter that is actually
   smart. By using load disaggregation intelligence, c-meter is the
   realization of demand response and other smart grid energy conservation
   initiatives. Our c-meter is made of two key components: a prototype open
   source ammeter and an optimized embedded load disaggregation algorithm
   (mu Disagg). Additionally, we provide an open source multi-circuit
   ammeter array that can build probabilistic appliance (or load)
   consumption models that are used by the c-meter. mu Disagg is the first
   load disaggregation algorithm to be implemented on an inexpensive
   low-power embedded processor that runs in real-time using a
   typical/basic smart meter measurement (current, in A). mu Disagg can
   disaggregate loads with complex power states with a high degree of
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In order to overcome the shortages that motion-level robot language is
   difficult to be transplanted, robot's functions are difficult to be
   extended because of the closed language environment and lacking of a
   standard motion-level robot language among robot manufacturers, a
   compiling and interpreting system of industrial robot which is based on
   the Lua script language in an open hardware control system is proposed.
   In this system, a set of more relatively general-used motion-level robot
   language has been designed. The structure of the software has been
   designed in using of object-oriented programming and the functions of
   the software have also been modularized to facilitate function
   extending. Implementation strategy of the interpreting part has been
   also designed in using of chain of responsibility pattern. Thus, the
   compiling and interpreting system becomes fully open-ended. The software
   which is constructed by the system has been demonstrated on Visual
   Studio 2008 platform, the experimental results indicate that the robot
   can move accurately under the control of the software and the functions
   of the software can be extended conveniently, thereby proves the
   compiling and interpreting system to be a suitable and effective method.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the open paradigm in design research and
   introduces a new conceptualization for `open design' and a three-layer
   framework to demonstrate the degrees of openness in design practices.
   The conceptualization comprises all stages in the design process,
   ranging from need-finding to the openness of the design documents and
   the data gathered during the design process, and the commercialization
   of the end-product. The aspects of the product and the process merge in
   this framework, intertwining the aspects of technical, legal and
   commercial openness. Finally, the article proposes a research agenda for
   open design. The article builds on an extensive literature review about
   studies on `open' in design: open-source software, open hardware, and
   participatory methods in design, such as co-design and participatory
   design, and user-engagement methods such as crowdsourcing and

Pages = {{803-810}},
Abstract = {{Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper
   (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive
   manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However,
   the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs
   and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has
   severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized
   metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive
   finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology
   for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in
   laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a <\$2000
   open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with
   an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost
   commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a
   deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design
   schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are
   provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D
   printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of
   printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions
   are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work
   necessary for the mass distribution of this technology.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the project was to investigate the flight behavior of a
   futuristic blended wing body concept in high altitudes. The shape to be
   tested was based on cooperation with its Swiss inventor Koni Schafroth
   from Team Smartfish {[}I]. The overall motivation for the project is the
   search for new reentry technologies. VEXREDUS stands for Vehicle with
   EXtended REentry Duration University of Stuttgart{''}, referring to
   reentry vehicles with a high Lift to Drag ratio.
   The project work involved the following tasks:
   CNC/CAM based mold construction
   Building of airframe in CFRP/GFRP sandwich technology
   Development of own autopilot software on existing open source hardware
   Implementation of own telemetry protocol
   Development of a ground station
   Development of a Redundant power supply
   Development of a parachute system
   Thermal and vacuum testing
   As a BEXUS team we were part of two launch campaigns at the ESRANGE
   facility in Northern Sweden. Though we had our share of setbacks, we
   were able to demonstrate the airframe's excellent flying characteristics
   and suitability for high altitude missions. The paper shall take a look
   at the technical challenges we've been facing and the investigations we
   made to learn more about the things that didn't work as expected, as
   well as the results drawn from the whole experiment.}},

   make connectivity both technically and economically feasible in rural
   Africa where affordable access remains a challenge. The superior
   propagation characteristics of TVWS technology make it particularly well

   measurements in Malawi and Zambia suggest that most UHF spectrum is
   already available both in urban as well as in rural areas and could be
   used to provide Internet connectivity. In this paper we present the
   findings of a TVWS spectrum measurement initiative in Malawi and Zambia.
   We introduce an open hardware device that geo-tags spectrum measurements
   and saves the results on a micro SD card. The device can also be used to
   record the use of spectrum over long periods of time.}},

Abstract = {{Outdoor air pollution now contributes annually to over 3.2 million
   premature deaths worldwide and is among the top health risk factors.
   Urban air pollution is on course to become the top environmental cause
   of mortality by 2050 - greater than the effects of dirty water and lack
   of sanitation. This risk is especially high in developing countries,
   where it is often difficult or expensive to obtain air quality data.
   This paper outlines the initial development of a system for mapping
   crowd-sourced air quality data in urban environments in developing
   countries. This system includes a (1) low cost wearable air quality
   monitor and (2) a mapping and data visualization web application for use
   in urban settings in developing countries. Based on open source hardware
   and software, the air quality monitor is composed of an Arduino
   microcontroller and sensor shields and collects real-time geographically
   explicit air quality data, with data storage on removable memory. The
   mapping and data visualization web application uses javascript functions
   and Google Maps API to visualize the paths travelled and the intensity
   of ozone and particulate matter as a heat map.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major obstacles in the study of HRI (human-robot interaction)
   with social robots is the lack of multiple identical robots that allow
   testing with large user groups. Often, the price of these robots
   prohibits using more than a handful. A lot of the commercial robots do
   not possess all the necessary features to perform specific HRI
   experiments and due to the closed nature of the platform, large
   modifications are nearly impossible. While open source social robots do
   exist, they often use high-end components and expensive manufacturing
   techniques, making them unsuitable for easy reproduction. To address
   this problem, a new social robotics platform, named Ono, was developed.
   The design is based on the DIY mindset of the maker movement, using
   off-the-shelf components and more accessible rapid prototyping and
   manufacturing techniques. The modular structure of the robot makes it
   easy to adapt to the needs of the experiment and by embracing the open
   source mentality, the robot can be easily reproduced or further
   developed by a community of users. The low cost, open nature and DIY
   friendliness of the robot make it an ideal candidate for HRI studies
   that require a large user group.}},

Abstract = {{During code review tasks, comparing two versions of a hardware design
   description using existing program differencing tools such as diff is
   inherently limited because these tools implicitly assume sequential
   execution semantics, while hardware description languages are designed
   to model concurrent computation. We designed a position-independent
   differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose
   relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an
   instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for
   Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a
   high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of
   Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on
   two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very
   accurate, with overall 96.8 \% precision and 97.3 \% recall when using
   manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also
   fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open
   projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight
   hardware design experts to understand how the program differences
   identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show
   that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification
   of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader
   socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural
   production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source
   practices. These include expansions from software into general culture
   through `Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from
   software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical
   perspective on the democratic potential of these broader `open'
   contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to
   both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic
   participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By
   analysing attempts to `open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it
   also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights
   developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source
   cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the
   generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source
   contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing
   production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across
   different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the
   democratic potential of these processes.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) are superconducting
   detectors capable of counting single photons and measuring their energy
   in the UV, optical, and near-IR. MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency
   domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the
   construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM,
   MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used
   for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead
   transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they
   present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we
   describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon
   counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for
   Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry. This readout is based on
   open source hardware developed by the Collaboration for Astronomy Signal
   Processing and Electronics Research. Designed principally for radio
   telescope backends, it is flexible enough to be used for a variety of
   signal processing applications. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{CERN makes extensive use of the WorldFIP fieldbus interface in the LHC

   more vulnerable to radiation of high energy particles than the previous
   versions. nanoFIP is a CERN design based on a Flash FPGA implementing a
   subset of the functionality allowed by the communication standard,
   fitting the requirements of the different users and including the

Abstract = {{One of the most demanding challenges in the field of audio engineering
   is the transmission of low-latency high quality audio streams over
   networks. While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network
   streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over
   existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far
   from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future
   scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless
   music production system based on open hardware and open software which
   requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high
   flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on
   Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music
   language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio,
   generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and
   other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on,
   enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a
   home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of anomalies in backbone networks is posing serious
   performance issues, not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of
   detection speed. Indeed current software solutions to the problem, even
   promising from the point of view of detection and false alarm rates,
   suffer from the inability of performing the required operations in real
   time, when working in high speed backbone networks. On the other hand,
   hardware solutions are based on costly and inflexible niche systems.
   To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a system based on a
   the implementation of a ``classical{''} CUSUM-based anomaly detection
   method on an open networking platform accelerator (i.e., NetFPGA). The
   objective is to combine the high performance of a hardware oriented
   solution with the flexibility of general purpose PCs.
   The experimental results, shown in the paper, clearly demonstrate that
   the proposed system is able to overcome the current software
   implementations and to operate in high-speed backbone networks.}},

Abstract = {{The high-precision and high-resolution surveying is not an easy
   question. The newest tools for those tasks are the unmanned systems,
   especially the aerial systems.
   The author built and developed a small and low-cost aerial surveying
   system, which fundamentally was based on a commercial model airplane and
   open-source hardware/firmware. The adaptation of these latter components
   allowed the semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of
   the airplane along a trajectory during surveying flights.
   The current used camera system is a small compact digital camera, which
   provides digital photographs with true-colour palette. During the
   flights, the camera was triggered automatically regarding to the
   requirements of the survey.
   With this configuration, very-high resolution photo mosaics were taken
   during several survey projects.
   This paper introduces the structure of the represented aerial system,
   especially the open-source autopilot system and some results.}},

   educational levels while keeping a very reduced cost. The robot is based
   on Arduino and the Printshield, our new electronics platform. It
   provides integration of various sensors (light, distance and line
   sensors) and actuators (motors, lights and speaker). It is also easy to
   expand by students and researchers. We describe our designs, and
   document their performance in various workshops with college, primary
   and secondary students. Our methodology is described and suggestions are

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to present an active and creative visualization
   method for mathematical concepts using 3D animation, modeling,
   simulation and story. The result is a first-hand experience of practical
   problems that need solutions. The method attempts to motivate
   investigation and problem solving by inviting the student to experience
   the problem itself through a creative activity.
   Although classic visualization models in mathematics involve three
   dimensional renderings and interactive animations and have proven to be
   effective in many situations, often they break down concepts into new
   concepts and then present segments to the observer. Most interactive
   models are predefined, driven by limited parameters that are available
   as a user interface. Many times we can see students wanting to use their
   creativity to interact instead of becoming the passive observer or
   operator.
   The active visualization method employs a measurable virtual 3D world
   with a time-line, a modeling tool-set and a physics simulation engine
   inside a common 3D animation package. The animation process strictly
   relies on segments controlled by non-linear function curves locked to
   time and therefore it provides an excellent ground to manipulate
   transformations without limitations even when those lead to problems.
   Students will engage in a creative activity that involves a story with a
   given goal by modeling and animating a phenomenon or group of phenomena
   that will lead to a problem they do not expect. The students will learn
   about a mathematical concept that provides the solution to their
   problem. They will integrate the concept and fix the problem to complete
   the story.
   Although there is a large number of topics and many levels of complexity
   where the method can be used at, for example modeling geometries to
   calculate volume or grouping large amounts of particles based on certain
   attributes, one of the most important elements is the storytelling that
   connects all participants.
   This work presents an example of using quaternion to adjust the rotation
   of a spaceship to change trajectory in order to fly back to the Earth.
   The spaceship will be driven to a gimbal lock in Euler angles.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber-fed multi-object spectrographs have greatly enhanced the
   spectroscopic capabilities of the world's premiere telescopes, but their
   flexibility has typically been limited by a fixed effective slit size
   that constrains the available resolving power. We present a novel
   mechanism that, for the first time, equips a fiber-fed spectrograph with
   multiple discreet slits of different widths. In this paper, we detail
   the mechanical design of our variable slit mechanism, which is capable
   of positioning any one of six slits in front of the fibers immediately
   prior to injection into the spectrograph's optical train. Further, we
   present the details of related system necessary to achieve closed loop
   positioning of the slit mechanism given that no encoder is used. We also
   briefly discuss our use of open source and open hardware projects in the
   design. Finally, we describe the control system we have implemented for
   this subsystem.}},

   Based on the Arduino platform, the easy to build radiosonde allows the

   packages that can be fully customized to their individual sensing
   requirements. This sensing/transmitter package has been successfully
   deployed on a tethered-balloon, a weather balloon, a UAV airplane, and
   is currently being integrated into a UAV quadcopter and a student-built
   rocket. In this paper, the system, field measurements and potential

   full control and open access to a measurement system in an age when
   commercial solutions have become popular but are restrictive in terms of

Abstract = {{An open source automation system for controlling electrical appliances
   using power line communication is presented here. Control messages are
   sent over Wi-Fi network from a Wi-Fi device to the micro-controller
   which then couples the messages to the power lines. Ubiquitous power
   lines are used as physical media to transmit data over 220V/50Hz signal
   to control appliances/equipment. The data from the microcontroller is
   coupled onto the power lines using a PLC (Power Line Communication)
   modem and DCSK (Differential Code Shift Keying) modulation technique is
   employed to transmit data. Each receiver unit consists of PLC modem plus
   microcontroller and can be connected anywhere in the power line network.
   The receivers have addresses assigned to them and only respond to the
   commands sent to them by the transmitter PLC modem. The receiver unit
   controls the flow of electricity to the socket. The entire system is
   devoid of a computer to save power and make it low cost. Use of open
   source hardware, Power Line Communication and micro-controller
   collectively reduce the cost of controlling appliances remotely.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor localization is an important part of integrated AAL solutions
   providing continuous services to elderly persons. They are able to
   fulfill multiple purposes, ranging from energy saving or location based
   reminders to burglary detection. Particularly useful are combined
   systems that include localization, as well as additional services e.g.
   fall detection. Capacitive sensing systems that allow detecting the
   presence of a body over distance are a possible solution for indoor
   localization that has been used in the past. However usually the
   installation requirements are high and consequently they are expensive
   to integrate. We propose a flexible, integrated solution based on
   affordable, open-source hardware that allows indoor localization and
   fall detection specifically designed for challenges in the context of
   AAL. The system is composed of sensing mats that can be placed under
   various types of floor covering that wirelessly transmit data to a
   central platform providing localization and fall detection services to
   connected AAL platforms. The system was evaluated noncompetitive in the
   2011 EvAAL indoor localization competition.}},

Abstract = {{Urban spaces are pervaded by interpretive and reactive technologies that
   shape and are shaped by its inhabitants, with an increasingly active
   role for citizen technologists. Yet the role of domestic spaces in
   shaping lived experience within the urban environment, and subsequent
   technological interventions, is often overlooked. Homes are framed as
   closed-off environments which isolate their inhabitants from the city,
   despite being porous spaces that are also filled with ubiquitous
   computing. In this paper we draw on the participatory design and user
   innovation literatures to present the methodology for the
   ``Homesense{''} research project that explored how users design and
   develop ``smart{''} technologies within their own homes, based on the
   intersection of their concurrent urban/domestic lived experience. Kits
   of open-source hardware were used as cultural probes, and co-located
   ``lead users{''} provided technical expertise. This methodology
   demonstrates the importance of physical space and location in user-led
   domestic activities, and of combinations of technical and ``lived{''}
   expertise in developing these interventions.}},

Title = {{VirtualSense: A Java-Based Open Platform for Ultra-Low-Power Wireless
   Sensor Nodes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Idleness has to be carefully exploited in wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs) to save power and to accumulate the energy possibly harvested
   from the environment. State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a
   wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup
   time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time
   they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz,
   which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine
   (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime
   environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk
   to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen
   as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in
   spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to
   keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the
   energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor
   node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its
   hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be
   redesigned in order to exploit idleness. This paper presents
   VirtualSense, an open-hardware open-source ultra-low-power reactive
   wireless sensor module featuring a Java-compatible VM.}},

Abstract = {{STEP-NC standard contains information on how CNC machine tools can be
   represented from STEP product data model. STEP-NC is an extension of
   STEP which is the standard for exchange product model data. This
   determines the neutral data format for digital information from a
   product. This paper is to propose an architecture of intelligent
   controller via multi-agent-based conceptual as the reference
   architecture. It can be successfully used to create an open CNC on ISO
   standard of ISO 14649 and ISO 10303. This offers interoperability,
   portability, and adaptability. The proposed framework consists of four
   main modules, STEP-NC interface, simulator, data warehouse, and
   communication. In order to optimize, the controller should incorporate
   with various technology related to intelligent, such as kernel software,
   open communication port and open hardware design. The architecture will
   be implemented in CNC controller and to be tested later on actual
   milling machine. It will simplify the design of CNC machine controller
   with the architecture layers responsible for data processing, data
   storage, execution and feedback. This paper will discuss order towards
   the requirements for global interoperable manufacturing for real-life

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and testing of an open and flexible
   embedded system applied to positioning and telecontrol (OFESAPO) for
   outdoor applications. The system is composed of a control center (CC)
   and a set of remote terminal units (RTUs); the International
   Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60870-5 series has been chosen for
   communication among them. This is a standard protocol of real-time
   telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs
   are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded
   system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate
   array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux
   operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used.
   As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard
   protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both
   the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests
   have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for
   real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real
   environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a
   CC using Google Map.}},

Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Although potentiostats are the foundation of modern electrochemical
   research, they have seen relatively little application in resource poor
   settings, such as undergraduate laboratory courses and the developing
   world. One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their
   cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory
   potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive
   electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs,
   and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for
   food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind,
   we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<\$80), open-source
   (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed
   by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports
   a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square
   wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate,
   it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food-and
   drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection,
   and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit
   board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly
   instructions are available in the supporting information and are

   This, coupled with the availability of free and open software

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the implementation of a Linux extension board
   for the e-puck educational mobile robot, designed to enhance the
   computation, memory and networking performance of the robot at very low
   cost. The extension board is based on a 32-bit ARM9 microprocessor and
   provides wireless network support. The ARM9 extension board runs in
   parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with
   communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is
   designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless
   communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while
   the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and
   motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating
   system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in
   a Micro SD card. The extended e-puck robot platform requires minimal
   effort to integrate the well-known open-source robot control framework
   Player and, when placed within a TCP/IP networked infrastructure,
   provides a powerful and flexible platform for experimental swarm
   robotics research. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Secure processors have become increasingly important for trustworthy
   computing as security breaches escalate. By providing hardware-level
   protection, a secure processor ensures a safe computing environment
   where confidential data and applications can be protected against both
   hardware and software attacks. In this paper, we present a single-chip
   secure processor model and demonstrate rapid prototyping of the secure
   processor on the OpenSPARC FPGA platform. OpenSPARC T1 is an
   industry-grade, open-source, FPGA-synthesizable general-purpose
   microprocessor originally developed by Sun Microsystems, now acquired by
   Oracle. It is a multi-core, multi-threaded 64-bit processor with
   open-source hardware, including the microprocessor core, as well as
   system software that can be freely modified by researchers. We modify
   the OpenSPARC T1 processor by adding security modules: an AES engine, a
   TRNG and a memory integrity tree. These enhancements enable security
   features like memory encryption and memory integrity verification. By
   prototyping this single-chip secure processor on the FPGA platform, we
   find that the OpenSPARC T1 FPGA platform has many advantages for secure
   processor research. Our prototyping demonstrates that additional modules
   can be added quickly and easily and they add little resource overhead to
   the base OpenSPARC processor.}},

Abstract = {{Based on previous classical learning models created for animation and
   digital artists, this work presents a framework that stimulates
   creativity by divergent thinking without compromising technology and
   specialization.
   The classical learning model focuses on specialization by utilizing
   dedicated technologies and devices. Although this approach has proven to
   be successful in the past because it is highly skill oriented, it
   promotes directive teaching practice through mainly audio-visual
   content. Even though the technology is specialized, it is also limited
   and because of the empirical nature of the process the artists develop
   linear, sometimes even convergent thinking.
   Open hardware technologies provide first-hand fabrication experience in
   a workshop environment embracing interdisciplinary collaboration and
   information sharing. The aesthetic experience is perceived through
   vision, sound, smell and touch while the interactive experience is
   created by sensors, micro-controllers, kinetic sculptures, puppets and
   installations connected to virtual 3D worlds. This kind of learning
   environment in conjunction with the emotional interest enhances the
   capacity to achieve original content and ideas that have value, while
   the divergent thinking helps to find solutions in various areas and
   industries.}},

Abstract = {{The use of technology by children from lower levels of education is very
   dependent on the utility perception that teachers may encounter in their
   use. But even those teachers who want to innovate experience many
   obstacles. On one hand, the difficulties they have to use certain
   technologies and on the other hand the difficulties faced by schools to
   invest in acquiring the necessary equipment. Teachers need to be created
   facilitating conditions for technology upgrades, to help them reach a
   personal motivation level for its use. To resolve the second difficulty
   it must be created an awareness that there are already several
   alternatives, including the use of open hardware and electronic
   equipment at low cost, combined with the use of free software. The
   construction of tangible objects using open hardware and software to
   create a technology alliance will facilitate the diffusion of use and
   enable children to explore new forms of narrative, usually associated
   with higher levels of education.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing student interest in renewable energy and electric
   vehicles. Energy storage is a critical technology for electric vehicles
   and to some extent for intermittent renewable energy sources. Battery
   life, performance, and cost remain a barrier to widespread use of
   battery energy storage. Increasing the number of students researching
   these technologies would increase the likelihood of progress.
   The process of testing batteries to characterize performance and
   durability typically requires the use of specialized equipment that may
   be beyond the budget for many educators. Hence, many interested students
   may not have access to the tools to perform these experiments.
   To remedy this, we have begun the development of an open source
   battery-testing platform that can be built at a fraction of the cost of
   commercial systems. Furthermore, the development of the testing platform
   provides educational opportunities for students.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a capstone project whose objective was to design,
   build and successfully test an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with
   real-time video surveillance capabilities. The student team was composed
   of seven students within an aeronautical concentration of their
   Mechanical Engineering Technology program. The students designed and
   built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect
   automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model
   radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the
   onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software,
   utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot
   system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from
   a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an
   open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows
   mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and
   monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is
   transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive
   design and build project, concluding with successful test flights,
   enhanced the student learning and performance during the course of the
   project. Assessment data gathered by the project faculty mentor are
   provided in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{We present SensLAB, a very large scale wireless sensor network
   testbed(1). SensLAB is distributed among 4 sites having different
   topologies and consists of 1024 wireless nodes based on open source
   hardware \& software. Within a given site, each one of the 256 nodes is
   able to communicate via its radio interface (868Mhz or 2.4Ghz) to its
   neighbors. Furthermore, every sensor node is potentially configurable as
   a sink node and can exchange data with any other sink node of the whole
   SensLAB testbed and/or Internet application. The testbed is designed to
   achieve reproducibility of experimentation, while also supporting
   evaluation of protocols and applications in real world settings. It
   allows to monitor transparently, i.e., without any
   insertion/modification within the code, any deployed application in
   terms of energy consumption or radio activity. The main benefits of
   SensLAB for the users are to reduce the costs in terms of:
   infrastructure investment, maintenance cost and operating cost. With
   SensLAB you can be up and running minutes after you are assigned an
   account! SensLAB's main and most important goal is to offer an accurate
   open access multi-users scientific tool to support the design,
   development, tuning, and experimentation of real large-scale sensor
   network applications. During this demo, we propose to demonstrate the
   interests of the SensLAB testbed by developing and running two
   experimental scenarii that highlight the services offered by SensLAB.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and micro air vehicles (MAV) are already
   intensively used in geodetic applications. State of the art autonomous
   systems are however geared towards the application area in safe and
   obstacle-free altitudes greater than 30 meters. Applications at lower
   altitudes still require a human pilot. A new application field will be
   the reconstruction of structures and buildings, including the facades
   and roofs, with semi-autonomous MAVs. Ongoing research in the MAV
   robotics field is focusing on enabling this system class to operate at
   lower altitudes in proximity to nearby obstacles and humans. PIXHAWK is
   an open source and open hardware toolkit for this purpose. The quadrotor
   design is optimized for onboard computer vision and can connect up to
   four cameras to its onboard computer. The validity of the system design
   is shown with a fully autonomous capture flight along a building.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years the functionality and type of UAV-systems increased
   fast, but unfortunately these systems are hardly available for
   researchers in some cases. A simple and low-cost solution was developed
   to build an autonomous aerial surveying airplane, which can fulfil the
   necessities ( aerial photographs with very-high resolution) of other
   departments at the university and very useful and practical for teaching
   photogrammetry.
   The base was a commercial, remote controlled model airplane and an
   open-source GPS/IMU system (MatrixPilot) was adapted to achieve the
   semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the model
   airplane along predefined trajectory. The firmware is completely
   open-source and easily available on the website of the project.
   The first used camera system was a low-budget, low-quality video camera,
   which could provide only 1.2 megapixel photographs or low resolution
   video depending on the light conditions and the desired spatial
   resolution.
   A field measurement test was carried out with the described system: the
   aerial surveying of an undiscovered archaeological site, signed by a
   crop-mark in mountain Pilis (Hungary).}},

Abstract = {{In 1this paper we investigate produsage using Actor-Network Theory with
   a focus on (produsage) skills, their development, and transformation. We
   argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the
   traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of
   essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or
   common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result
   of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view,
   the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be
   explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on
   this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the
   Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of
   human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how
   skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements for modern and future control systems for large projects
   like International Linear Collider demand high availability for control
   system components. Recently telecom industry came up with a great open
   hardware specification - Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA).
   This specification is aimed for better reliability, availability and
   serviceability. Since its first market appearance in 2004. ATCA platform
   has shown tremendous growth and proved to be stable and well represented
   by a number of vendors. ATCA is an industry standard for highly
   available systems. On the other hand Service Availability Forum, a
   consortium of leading communications and computing companies, describes
   interaction between hardware and software. SAF defines a set of
   specifications such as Hardware Platform Interface, Application
   Interface Specification. SAF specifications provide extensive
   description of highly available systems, services and their interfaces.
   Originally aimed for telecom applications, these specifications can be
   used for accelerator controls software as well. This study describes
   benefits of using these specifications and their possible adoption to
   accelerator control systems. It is demonstrated how EPICS Redundant IOC
   was extended using Hardware Platform Interface specification, which made
   it possible to utilize benefits of the ATCA platform. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Moving object segmentation plays an important role in a complex object
   tracking system. This system decides whether the current block belongs
   to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background
   modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving
   object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed.
   Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H/W) architecture
   design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block
   template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate
   for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current
   frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and
   objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel
   intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as
   intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting
   values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large
   difference between the object and the background region. Based on
   experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object
   segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded
   system. (C) 2010 Society for Imaging Science and Technology. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We present a lab kit platform based on an Arduino microcontroller board
   and open hardware that enables students to use low-cost, course specific
   hardware to complete lab exercises at home. The platform is designed to
   be accessible to a wide range of students and easily adapted for other
   applications. Careful hardware selection allows existing laboratory
   exercises to be modified for use with the platform, and the platform
   enables new exercises that would not be possible in a traditional lab.
   We describe the adoption of these kits in a course designed for
   on-campus and remote students that teaches the science and technology of
   modern display systems. We find that the platform delivers a consistent,
   high quality laboratory experience for both on-campus and remote
   students.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reviews show large failure rates in the commercialization of new
   product designs Often, the reason of failure has been not a lack of
   technological capability of the firm, but a wrong understanding of
   customer preferences Extending the concept of adaptable smart products,
   our concept of ``embedded toolkits for user co-design{''} proposes to
   design products with build-in flexibility by embedding knowledge and
   rules about possible product differentiations into the product This
   approach can be seen as a scalable attempt towards ``open hardware{''},
   extending the open innovation paradigm beyond software towards tangible
   products Users are enabled to modify a product directly according to
   their individual needs. We present a technology acceptance study (TAM)
   of such an embedded toolkit in an automobile. Surveying 163 users
   demonstrates the general feasibility and value drivers of embedded
   toolkits Our paper contributes to the literature by discussing the
   contingency factors and the tactical and strategic implications of
   embedded open toolkits for user innovation}},

Abstract = {{ANIMA has as a primary objective to compare three non-conventional human
   com-puter interfaces that comply with the industrial robot ST Robotics
   R-17 instructions. This mod-ule, Alpha Waves Related Potentials - ARP-
   explains how brain waves are obtained, processed, analyzed and
   identified depending on their frequency. This module makes use of the
   Open EEG Project's open hardware monitor for brain wave activity, called
   the modular EEG. The brain waves are obtained through an electrode cap
   complying with the international 10-20 system for electrode positioning.
   The brain waves are processed with a fast Fourier transform using a
   mi-crocontroller and analyzed in software identifying the alpha wave's
   contribution. A program identifies the amount of time that alpha wave
   generation was maintained through concentration, and instructions are
   sent to the robotic arm, executing one of four pre-defined routines.
   Thirty percent of the users attained control over the robotic arm with
   the human computer interface.}},

Abstract = {{In the last fifteen years, the technological education has been
   essentially based on digital technology, leaving aside the use of
   concrete material. Still having excellent simulators of the physical
   world, working with concrete material allows the development of
   cognitive structures that digital doesn't offer. Moreover, these
   didactic resources allow highly participative group dynamics that have
   not been yet reached by the existing computers at schools.
   Unfortunately, in our view there are two major difficulties for the
   presence of these resources in the classroom. The physical technology is
   expensive and suffers from constant wear. On the other hand, teachers
   arc not accustomed to working in a dynamic classroom with a methodology
   of work in a participative group, and have fears about the use of
   specific technological equipment. Physical Etoys is a development that
   aims to overcome these difficulties.
   Physical Etoys facilitates the interaction between inexperienced users
   and concrete material such as open hardware devices or popular toys by
   providing a powerful and intuitive visual programming system in order to
   explore and learn science in an enjoyable way. The objective of this
   paper is to introduce a new module of Physical Etoys which aims to
   persuade kids to do different electronic projects with an Arduino Board.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces a computer numerical control (CNC)-based open
   hardware architecture system to realize the special functions of
   automated tape-laying (ATL) in a numerical control system. It associates
   a programmable multi-axis controller (PMAC) as the motion control unit
   with programmable numerical controllers (PCL-725, PCL-730) for on-off
   control. To bring about synchronized movements of the main 5-axis
   tape-laying head system and the 3-axis ultrasonic tape-cutting
   sub-system, the tracking-control method associated with time-based mode
   attributed to PMAC is applied in different cases. In addition, with the
   goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as
   synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000
   system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical
   interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also
   designed. This system is helpful to solve complicated problems in
   designing numerical controls for ATL such as ensuring high requirements
   for precise machine control and synchronization of motion control and
   on-off control.}},

Abstract = {{The NetFPGA platform is designed to enable students and researchers to
   build networking systems that run at line-rate, and to create re-usable
   designs to share with others. Our goal is to eventually create a
   thriving developer-community, where developers around the world
   contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community
   as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of ``User
   Contributed Designs{''} at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ``open-source
   hardware{''} platform is quite different from software oriented
   open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming and
   more error prone than designing software, and so demands a process that
   is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised,
   else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel
   process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is
   specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a
   list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set
   of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope
   to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and
   to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and
   integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our
   process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe
   the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA
   repository.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an on-going project that consists in providing
   low-cost telephony services in remote areas in the Amazon region, North
   Brazil. The idea is to build GSM networks using open-source and
   open-hardware projects, such as: OpenBTS, Openmoko, IP04, Asterisk and
   USRP. The NavegaPara Program, which currently connects thirteen cities
   in the state, provides the backbone network with optical fiber and
   digital radios. This paper summarizes the project and discusses the
   strategy adopted to circumvent a specific problem: the establishment of
   know-how on GSM technologies among engineering (electrical and computer)
   students. Several hands-on experiments in GSM technologies are being
   currently used and some are described here. For example, the work
   discusses how the Matlab toolkit GSMsim can be used to analyze digitized
   GSM waveforms. It also describes the development of a QAM modulator for
   better understanding the basics of GNU Radio. The success of the project
   will be measured by the effect in the life of citizens who, currently,
   do not have any access to a phone for basic communication needs.}},

Abstract = {{In today's society, collaboration between individuals and groups
   thousands of miles away has become increasingly common place. Due
   primarily to the rapid growth of broadband internet, cheap data storage
   and fast microchip technology, a new frontier has been opened where
   engineers and scientists can quickly and efficiently share large amounts
   of information with colleagues all across the globe. The implications of
   this technology have been and continue to become increasingly
   influential on the evolution of not just the sciences, but humanity as a
   whole. This paper will survey current successes that have been seen in
   open source software development and the emergent `open design' realm.
   From here, parallels are drawn between the two disciplines to illustrate
   how engineering organizations can benefit from the highly distributed
   nature that open source software has implemented. In this light, this
   paper will establish the position that engineering design must make the
   shift towards a more open and collaborative environment to stay relevant
   and prosper in the Information Age. Additionally, a basic web framework
   detailing the technologies needed to see such a shift occur will be
   outlined. Currently, there is some research being done in this area, but
   overall the possibilities for growth and innovation are significant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the High Bandwidth High Throughput (HBHT)
   Government Reference Architecture (GRA) effort and utilization of
   Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) tools to validate the architecture.
   This paper is intended to show how the development of GRA compliant
   modules advances both new and time-tested technologies through
   establishing a standard for Above 2 GHz SATCOM Terminal modules. The
   paper will also describe plans to develop and apply tools, products and
   solutions to validate the GRA.
   The paper describes the process associated with engaging industry in
   developing the GRA. Functional Decomposition, validating the GRA through
   a prototype, creating the GRA as a standard for the Army HC3 Program,
   and managing to that architecture and standard in a development
   environment. The paper also describes how GRA validation through use of
   DSM tools, such as LATTIX, will aid in the development and testing of a
   GRA Hardware and Software Interface Test Development Environment
   designed to allow a GRA module developer to develop, interface, and test
   interface applications to the GRA compatible open hardware/software
   interfaces. Full documentation shall be developed for all open hardware
   and software interfaces, sufficient to develop applications with minimum
   interface or interaction with the module developer. Interface definition
   stability over time will be a key factor in the mission success of the
   HC3 open system interfaces, so they must be designed with stability and
   longevity in mind.
   This paper will review alternatives for validation of GRA compliant
   modules. Particular emphasis will be placed on DSM techniques. The
   interdependencies between modules will be modeled using a DSM so as to
   provide a big picture view of GRA. DSM can also be used to model and
   expose key design decisions for the entire team. Rules can be
   established in the DSM model for GRA compliance to guide a GRA module
   developer during development and testing for validation. The use of DSM
   to model various hardware and software modules in the HBHT will create a
   common artifact that can be shared across various teams with different
   skills and domains of expertise. DSM can also be used to analyze the
   impact of change. Over time, DSM will provide a blue print of the
   architecture and how it evolves to meet changing needs.}},

   In the paper we explain the potential of Wearable Computing and focus on
   the technological challenges. During the last five years (2004 till
   2009) the EC funded the worldwide largest project on Wearable Computing:
   wearIT@work (www.wearitatwork.com)(1). The project did not focus on new
   technologies. However, with existing technologies new applications were
   developed. For new user groups of mobile workers a new quality of
   support had to be achieved. The paper reports at the end of the project
   on the main findings and lessons learned: An open hardware platform, an
   open software framework and for seven different application domains
   solutions were developed.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous recording of electrophysiology and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique of growing importance in
   neuroscience. Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have
   created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for
   specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a
   variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field
   potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and
   costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal
   processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning,
   attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet
   real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe
   an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI
   featuring low-noise (< 0.6 mu V p-p input noise), electromagnetic
   compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7T), and user-programmable real-time
   signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete
   specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological
   data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit
   board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic
   assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor
   information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid
   implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system
   has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the
   auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as
   well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human
   primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology
   studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level. Published by
   Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Methods to determine cytokine protein content in samples of interest,
   such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are often
   labor-intensive and costly. Furthermore, because ELISA requires
   relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is
   difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple
   cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an
   open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based
   antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a
   single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 2000
   platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain
   regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known
   concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6,
   and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a
   mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known
   quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a
   single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay
   kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between
   81\% and 103\% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J
   mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
   sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from
   LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine
   protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete
   brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from
   vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines
   may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a
   single sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
   channels, direct measurement is the main viable option for accurate
   characterization. Details on a new low-cost wideband channel sounder are

   and components. This switched architecture system is similar to
   commercial channel sounders and has modest cost (< US\$ 50000). The
   sounder operates in the 2- to 8-GHz range with up to 100 MHz of
   instantaneous bandwidth and supports eight transmitters and receivers,
   which are sufficient to support the development and assessment of
   current and future MIMO wireless systems. In this ``open-hardware{''}
   project, the hardware design and software components are openly
   available to other researchers interested in developing or enhancing the

Abstract = {{An analog VLSI hardware architecture for the distributed simulation of
   large-scale spiking neural networks has been developed. Several hundred
   integrated computing nodes, each hosting up to 512 neurons, will he
   interconnected and operated on un-cut silicon wafers. The
   electro-technical aspects and the details of the hardware implementation
   are covered in a separate contribution to this conference. This paper
   focuses on the usability of the system by demonstrating that
   biologically relevant network models can in fact be mapped to this
   system. Different network configurations am established on the hardware
   by programmable switch matrices, repeaters, and address decoders.
   Systematic routing algorithms are presented to map a given network model
   to the hardware system. Routing is simulated for several network
   examples, proving the system's practical applicability. Furthermore, the
   routing simulations are used to fix values for yet open hardware

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a complete RTU (Remote Terminal Unit)
   with a System-on-Chip solution based completely on both open hardware
   and software platforms, and developed in conjunction with two industrial
   companies. The target implementation of the embedded system is a Spartan
   family FPGA from Xilinx. The article presents the main features of the
   base system, which consists of the LEON microprocessor and a Linux
   operating system distribution (Debian) running on it. Moreover, it shows
   a complete example of how to add new peripherals to the system. The
   peripheral that has been added is the UART 16550 compatible peripheral
   available in OpenCores. Given that the design has been prepared for the
   WishBone bus, it was necessary to adapt it to the APB bus within the
   LEON core. Furthermore, it has been adapted to work with the Linux
   driver for that UART to get a full coupling of peripheral with the
   system. The experimental results confirm the work done.}},

Abstract = {{A current trend in learning programs, even at high-degree studies, is
   applying the concepts of ``learning by projects{''}. In this context,
   the LEGO (R) MINDSTORMS (R) NXT modular robot appears as a simple,
   flexible and attractive educational platform to achieve the referred
   challenge in many domains of information technologies, especially in
   real-time control. The project team can operate with the real system
   (e.g. constructed robot) to realize a number of particular tasks. The
   ready-to-use embedded platform and dual microcontrollers architecture
   represents actual trends in the modern control systems designs. The open
   hardware and software architecture gives unlimited possibility to handle
   all devices connected to the main control brick and write effective
   control algorithms.
   The proposed rescue robot project is a good example of the simple system
   where, a number of real-time control problems can be analyzed. The
   project on this scale requires detailed planning, cooperation in teams,
   extensive literature survey, and comprehensive software design. That is
   exactly, what we need for ``learning by projects{''} concept.}},

   open-source hardware called Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP),
   which best matches the GNU Radio, is used as a front-end to acquire the
   satellite beacon signals of 150 and 400 MHz. The first experiment was
   successful as results from GRBR showed very good agreement to those from

   application is a SoC implementation of a Voice Over IP (VoIP) Gateway.

Abstract = {{The open source software movement has been going on for a few decades
   now. Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the
   market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed
   solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and
   OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server,
   MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among
   the most well-known and widely used open source software on the
   Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird
   email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise
   systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system
   (CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open
   source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and
   Asterisk - a complete IP PBX).
   The open source culture is about much more than software and includes
   open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights,
   completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how
   business models are developed.
   To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of
   what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects
   (different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a
   thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and
   security.
   Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of
   open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD
   License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What
   can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between
   licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source
   Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten
   conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license.
   Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or
   release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly
   complying with licenses. Such ``dirty code{''} is increasingly easy to
   detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business.
   (Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.)
   Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in
   mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits.
   The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source
   solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) including for example
   licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial
   design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product.
   This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including
   software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
   alternatives, system design going from a monolithic, single-binary,
   firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Eye tracking has long held the promise of being a useful methodology for
   human computer interaction. However, a number of barriers have stood in
   the way of the integration of eye tracking into everyday applications,
   including the intrusiveness, robustness, availability and price of
   eye-tracking systems. To lower these barriers, we have developed the
   openEyes system. The system consists of an open-hardware design for a
   digital eye tracker that can be built from low-cost off-the-shelf
   components, and a set of open-source software tools for digital image
   capture, manipulation, and analysis in eye-tracking applications. We
   expect that the availability of this system will facilitate the
   development of eye-tracking applications and the eventual integration of
   eye tracking into the next generation of everyday human computer
   interfaces. We discuss the methods and technical challenges of low-cost
   eye tracking as well as the design decisions that produced our current
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Industrialised nations have dedicated significant investments toward the
   development of civil infrastructure. To preserve this investment,
   attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health
   Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of
   smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to
   significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have
   been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The
   Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open
   hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote
   was designed for generic applications and therefore the available
   sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications.
   Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities
   to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available
   sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil
   infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new
   acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform
   and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil
   infrastructure applications.}},

Abstract = {{The open model for solutions development is quickly extending from
   software to other technology areas, such as hardware and services.
   Specifically, just as open source has spawned a revolution in the
   technical, business, and legal model for software, open hardware will
   provide a swell of collaborative innovation that will create entirely
   new markets and provide significant business benefits to the most
   creative, most reliable, and most adaptable semiconductor, EDA,
   System-On-Chip (SoC) and systems houses. The open-source software stack
   with Linux as its cornerstone is increasingly the preferred choice for
   newly venture-funded companies. Open hardware will also change the world
   of SoC venture investing. While the degree of openness and the business
   model may vary, SoC products have to be increasingly developed through a
   collaborative model that helps assemble IP blocks and services from
   multiple sources. In this paper we describe the open standards model for
   hardware, chip, and tool innovation, and we argue the a systematic IP
   valuation methodology will help the success of this. environment, in
   that it will allow each member of the value chain especially small

Abstract = {{To make the complex mechanical equipment work in good service, the
   technology for realizing an embedded open system is introduced
   systematically, including open hardware configuration, customized

   technology is adopted in this system, integrating the CPU main-board
   functions, and achieving the quick, real-time signal acquisition and
   intelligent data analysis with applying DSP and CPLD data acquisition
   card. Under the open configuration, the signal bus mode such as PCI, ISA
   and PC/104 can be selected and the styles of the signals can be chosen
   too. In addition, through customizing XPE system, adopting the EWF
   (Enhanced Write Filter), and realizing the open system authentically,
   the stability of the system is enhanced. Multi-thread and multi-task
   programming techniques are adopted in the software programming process.
   Interconnecting with the remote fault diagnosis center via the net
   interface, cooperative diagnosis is conducted and the intelligent degree
   of the fault diagnosis is improved.}},

Abstract = {{A current focus of many instrumentation and Automatic Test Equipment
   (ATE) designers is the area of Synthetic Instrumentation. This
   instrumentation, which consists of physically separate building blocks
   or modules, provides the opportunity to reduce the system's overall
   hardware content by eliminating common hardware functionality located
   within each traditional instrument. This modular design provides
   opportunities for lower lifecycle cost, smaller physical packages and
   increased capabilities through module upgrades. However, the design of
   synthetic instrumentation and its integration into an ATE system poses
   technical challenges not typically seen with traditional
   instrumentation.
   Traditional instrument developers are now faced with the challenge of
   determining how their existing and future modules, for example a
   digitizer or waveform generator, satisfy a portion of the requirements
   of a synthetic instrument. ATE developers are challenged to identify the
   proper set of modules, primarily Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), that
   together satisfy the system level requirements. In addition, they must
   address instrumentation concurrency, synchronization, switching, and
   develop a software and hardware architecture that supports future
   upgrades as technology advances. Each of these issues requires a strong
   system engineering discipline that can develop a robust system
   architecture.
   In 2002 SEI began a program to integrate synthetic instrumentation that
   provided the functionality of a spectrum analyzer, A/D converter,
   counter timer, UART and AVMUX into a legacy Air Force Test Station. In
   2003 SEI continued with an additional program that consisted of design
   and development of a synthetic instrument that provided the
   functionality of a power meter, spectrum analyzer, frequency time
   interval counter, oscilloscope and digital multi meter. During each of
   these programs SEI worked directly with commercial instrument
   manufacturers, electrical designers and the military to establish the
   system requirements and resulting architecture. This paper will describe
   the key technical issues encountered while defining the system
   architecture including concurrency, modularity, synchronization, and
   maintaining an open hardware and software architecture. In addition, the
   resultant system architecture will be described.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing interest towards the utilization of open hardware and
   software platforms for industrial control applications has arisen during
   the last decade. Some of the most important developed projects are OSACA
   in Europe, OSEC in Japan and OMAC in the US. All these efforts are
   directed to the definition of an open architecture for controllers of
   manufacturing systems. The PC (personal computer) as the control
   platform facilitates the conectivity, standardization and availability
   of components, and the cost reduction. An aspect, however, remains
   scarcely analized: the application of these concepts on equipments
   designed with a propietary control structure. An open control system for
   an SCARA industrial robot YAMAHA YK7000 has been developed to analize
   its viability and evaluate difficulties and limitations. The controller
   follows the guidelines defined by the OMAC architecture (Open Modular
   Architecture for Controllers). The control functions were implemented on
   a dual platform (two PCs): The first PC supports the critical functions.
   executing the paths planning and axes control tasks with a commercial
   axes control card. The second one supports the functions of user
   interfacing with the user and other non-critical time applications. Both
   computers are connected by a TCP/IP link.}},

Abstract = {{The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is a small, low-budget
   amateur aerospace group. PSAS is currently developing medium-sized
   sub-orbital rockets with the eventual goal of inserting nanosatellites
   (satellites that weigh less than 10 kg) into orbit. Because achieving
   orbit requires a navigation system able to guide the rocket along an
   orbital trajectory, PSAS is pioneering an open source and open hardware
   avionics system that is capable of active guidance.
   In this paper, we describe how free software and open hardware have
   dramatically changed the capabilities of amateur aerospace groups like
   PSAS. We show how we have applied existing and custom free software to
   the avionics and ground support systems of a sub-orbital sounding
   rocket, and discuss what further work must be done.
   We conclude that the sophistication and complexity achieved by current
   amateur avionics projects-which are beginning to challenge the
   distinction between amateur and professional-would not be possible
   without the use of free software.}},

   stroboscopic phase-shifting interferometry with the digital image
   processing technology. Some improved algorithms together with the sub
   pixel method and 2D waveform transform technology are bought forward and
   experimented for the measurement of micro motions with higher
   resolution. The methods could measure micro motions up to tens of KHz in
   real time with nano resolution and the characterization is both in situ
   and nondestructive. Based upon the virtual instrument technology, the
   measurement system with friendly user interfaces, open hardware and

Abstract = {{The thrust of this study is to construct an MPLS test-bed using open
   hardware and software and later use this test-bed for experimenting
   various traffic engineering options available with MPLS. We have
   constructed a test-bed using Pentium PCs and Linux and used this
   test-bed to try a well-known MPLS traffic engineering feature of
   separating flows into multiple trunks. The. purpose of this separation
   is to experimentally assess the quality of service benefits we can
   expect from MPLS networks. We experiment with a hierarchical separation
   structure where the first level of separation is based on the transport
   layer used (TCP or UDP). This high level separation prevents UDP from
   unfairly grabbing the available bandwidth from TCP applications. Since
   different applications using TCP have different needs, e.g., some might
   want high bandwidth while others are more sensitive to packet delay, the
   second level of separation is based on application type. The results
   from our open experimental test-bed confirms the intuitive results by
   demonstrating better QoS with the flow separation in the MPLS core.}},

Abstract = {{The Cuban Weather Radar Network is composed by 3 RC-32B (Japan) and 4

   mount a modernized radar prototype at Camaguey Meteorological Center,
   incorporating computer control and data acquisition hardware to achieve
   fully unmanned operation. Modernization of conventional weather radars
   is now possible within a small budget using open hardware and software
   architectures. Our Primary Processor ``ELBRUS{''} (Signal Processor +
   Radar Controller) makes use of available computer cards and commercial
   PC systems. The system architecture was designed with a particular
   stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data
   Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product
   Generator and Processing System were developed. Vests processor Vesta
   RPG and its front end application Vesta\textbackslash{}Process deal with
   product and composite generation, data base management and web server
   links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard
   protocols. Results obtained with this prototype are now being extended
   to other 6 radars under a National Program for the modernization of the
   Cuban Weather Radar Network, which also includes composition and
   distribution of the products.

Abstract = {{With the widespread applications of GPS and the ever changing and
   evolving GPS requirements and capabilities, both in the commercial and
   military markets, there is a need for a flexible open architecture GPS
   receiver that would support laboratory development testing of GPS
   receiver design concepts, integration schemes, and GPS applications. The
   experience of the Central Engineering Activity (CEA) GPS Laboratory at
   NRaD San Diego supports the need for such a receiver. The special
   investigations and R\&D GPS projects conducted by NRaD frequently
   require novel integration or data collection capabilities. These would
   only be readily available in a flexible receiver with a high degree of
   adaptability to the laboratory's ever-changing needs. The GPS
   Integration Receiver-Programmable (GPS-PRO) receiver, which utilizes an
   open hardware and software architecture, provides the necessary
   flexibility to perform this function.
   The GPS-PRO uses Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware, an open
   architecture for external sensors, external communications and control,
   digital control, open software architecture, functional breakout points,
   and an upgradable daughter board concept for application specific
   systems. Such a receiver configuration provides the flexibility to
   interchange or insert new hardware or software modules in order to
   evaluate their performance in a controlled environment or provide an
   integrated system solution. The GPS-PRO flexible (programmable)
   functionality allows for its use as a design tool for R\&D and hardware
   in-the-loop testing, application specific tailoring for low cost, small
   size customer demands, while providing benchmark performance
   capabilities.}},
