Abstract = {{Series dc arc fault creates a fire hazard and negative impacts on the
   distribution bus if not detected and isolated quickly. However, the
   detection of a series arc fault is challenging due to the low fault
   current, lack of zero-crossing, and the erratic behavior of arc
   discharge based on different power electronic loads and controllers in
   modern power applications. This article presents a practical and
   versatile series dc arc fault detection method based on ensemble machine
   learning (EML) algorithms. A buck converter constant power load (CPL)
   and a boost converter CPL are designed and built to study the different
   arc fault behaviors and generate training data for the machine learning
   algorithms. A set of time domain features is extracted from the
   experimental data and analyzed using the feature importance attribute.
   An adaptive normalization function then processed the features to
   mitigate false positive classification caused by load changes. A
   two-step algorithm is proposed to recognize the arc fault in different
   load types. Various EML algorithms and the associated hyperparameters
   are benchmarked to select the most accurate hyperparameters for a
   detection algorithm for low-cost hardware implementation. Finally, the
   detection algorithm's effectiveness is verified with CPL testbed.}},

Abstract = {{Optical-based navigation for space is a field growing in popularity due
   to the appeal of efficient techniques such as Visual Simultaneous
   Localisation and Mapping (VSLAM), which rely on automatic feature
   tracking with low-cost hardware. However, low-level image processing
   algorithms have traditionally been measured and tested for ground-based
   exploration scenarios. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature
   by analysing state-of-the-art local feature detectors and descriptors
   with a taylor-made synthetic dataset emulating a Non-Cooperative
   Rendezvous (NCRV) with a complex spacecraft, featuring variations in
   illumination, rotation, and scale. Furthermore, the performance of the
   algorithms on the Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) is investigated as a
   possible solution to the challenges inherent to on-orbit imaging in the
   visible, such as diffuse light scattering and eclipse conditions. The
   Harris, GFTT, DoG, Fast-Hessian, FAST, CenSurE detectors and the SIFT,
   SURF, LIOP, ORB, BRISK, FREAK descriptors are benchmarked for images of
   Envisat. It was found that a combination of Fast-Hessian with BRISK was
   the most robust, while still capable of running on a low resolution and
   acquisition rate setup. For large baselines, the rate of false-positives
   increases, limiting their use in model-based strategies.}},

Title = {{Recovery from compressed measurements using Sparsity Independent
   Regularized Pursuit}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{172}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Compressed sensing (CS) is a pioneering sub-Nyquist sampling technique
   that reconstructs signals from far fewer measurements than traditional
   acquisition schemes. Considerable amount of research has been carried
   out over the years to develop powerful algorithms that can accomplish
   optimal recovery. However, they vary considerably in their ease of
   implementation, speed of recovery and noise resilience. This work
   presents the Sparsity Independent Regularized Pursuit (SIRP) which
   achieves an admirable trade-off between these key features. Further, it
   requires no prior knowledge of exact sparsity level and possesses a
   regular structure, making it amenable to low cost hardware solutions.
   Experimental investigations reveal the competitiveness of SIRP with
   existing state-of-art in regard to successful recovery and significant
   speed-up. The algorithm also attains superior results on a considerably
   large image recovery problem, which demonstrates its suitability to real
   world applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a novel method to generate a trajectory for a
   two-wheeled mobile robot moving in an uncertain environment where only a
   few way-points are available to reach a nearby target state. The
   proposed method interpolates way-points by the combination of a straight
   line and a fifth-order Bezier curve along which the curvature varies
   continuously. In addition, a method to generate the associated timing
   law is proposed such that the robot travels along the curve in near
   minimum time under the maximum velocity and torque constraints. Since
   the method aims for an online application, heuristic techniques are
   applied to minimize the computational cost for finding the optimal
   solution. The time for computing a complete time-optimal trajectory for
   a moving robot to transit to a next way-point is only several
   milliseconds when tested in a personal computer. This result implies
   that a highly efficient motion control system for a two-wheeled mobile
   robot can be implemented with a low-cost hardware available today.}},

Journal = {{CHEMKON}},
Abstract = {{From medical technology like plastic syringes, cannulas and ampoules to
   blister packs or tea light cups - experimental instructions using
   low-cost equipment are supposed to be a solution for cost- and
   time-efficient, environmentally friendly as well as motivating lab work
   even with high numbers of students. However, there are no empirical
   studies in science education that evaluate the use of such equipment
   with regard to these aspects. Therefore, a study is presented with N=89
   secondary school students who have carried out a low-cost distillation
   and were questioned afterwards about their practical experiences and
   their perception towards the equipment. The results of the qualitative
   survey are presented in a category system, which will then be used to
   derive practical implications for the general application of low-cost

Abstract = {{Aim: Current pricing of commercial mechanical ventilators in
   low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) markedly restricts their
   availability, and consequently a considerable number of patients with
   acute/chronic respiratory failure cannot be adequately treated. Our aim
   was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive
   bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage
   of ventilators in LMICs.
   Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials
   available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two
   pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital
   display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided
   open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and
   compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator;
   Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively
   breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive
   diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance
   and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients.
   Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory
   pressures up to 20/10 cm H2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or
   cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing
   difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was
   significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45 +/- 1.68 without support to
   2.83 +/- 1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no
   difference with the commercial device (2.80 +/- 1.48; p=1.000).
   Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs
   similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source
   hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in
   LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients
   who otherwise could not be treated.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years we have assisted to a growing interest for embedded
   vision, due to the availability of low cost hardware systems, effective
   for energy consumption, flexible for their size at the cost of limited
   (compared to the server) computing resources. Their use is boosted by
   the simplicity of their positioning in places where energy or network
   bandwidth is limited. Smart cameras are digital cameras embedding
   computer systems able to host video applications; due to the cost and
   the performance, they are progressively gaining popularity and
   conquering large amount of the market. Smart cameras are now able to
   host on board video applications, even if this imposes an heavy
   reformulation of the algorithms and of the software design so as to make
   them compliant with the limited CPUs and the small RAM and flash memory
   (typically of a few megabytes). In this paper we propose a method for
   gender recognition on video sequences, specifically designed for making
   it suited to smart cameras; although the algorithm uses very limited
   resources (in terms of RAM and CPU), it is able to run on smart cameras
   available today, presenting at the same time an high accuracy on
   unrestricted videos taken in real environments (malls, shops, etc.).}},

Abstract = {{Recently in many works, it has been identified that large-scale
   multiple-input-multiple-output (LS-MIMO) is one of the key technologies
   for achieving extraordinary gains of energy and spectral efficiencies in
   wireless communication systems. This technology employs low cost
   hardware which enlightens its significance. The efficiency of
   single-cell or multi-cell LS-MIMO systems is affected by various factors
   such as hardware impairments, energy consumption, bandwidth allocation
   and outdated channel. In this paper LS-MIMO systems have been analyzed
   with the effects of channel aging or often called outdated channel. New
   expression for minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) estimate has been
   derived for LS-MIMO system in downlink (DL). We use three precoding
   schemes and results show that regularized zero-forcing (RZF) gives
   better performance than zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio combining
   (MRT). We also show that how Doppler's shift in combination of outdated
   channel affects the performance of the system with all the above
   mentioned precoding schemes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An IoT-based remote IV tracing system for analysis of city-wide solar
   power facilities}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{57}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way future cities are
   planned. The concept of embedding intelligence into spaces and objects
   makes it possible to build all sorts of smart and distributed systems
   that automate and improve everyday operations in the fields of health,
   energy, manufacturing, and transport, amongst others. One of the most
   significant visions to come out of the IoT revolution is Smart Cities.
   Equipped with sensing and communication technologies and powered by
   renewable energy sources, Smart Cities could be the key to protecting
   environmental resources and ensuring sustainable urbanization as the
   world population continues to grow. Of the various available renewable
   energy sources, solar is one of the most popular and promising. However,
   solar energy is a function of its environment, and sudden changes in
   meteorological conditions can cause intermittency and disrupt power
   generation. In desert regions where solar energy is the most plausible
   option for renewable energy, dust-based soiling remains the biggest
   obstacle. The accumulation of dust particles on the surface of PV
   modules can obstruct the absorption of radiation by the module,
   effectively reducing its output. One common method to measure soiling
   loss is to perform Current-Voltage (IV) Tracing; where the
   characteristics of a PV module are used to evaluate the performance of
   the module. However, solar facilities in smart cities are often
   distributed in the form of small farms, rooftop installations, and
   parking lot shades in order to make use of the available space and
   reduce power lines. This represents a challenge to monitoring and
   maintaining soiled panels due to the scale and distribution of the
   installations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation
   of an IoT-based solar monitoring system for city-wide, large-scale, and
   distributed solar facilities in smart cities. The system uses low-cost
   hardware and IoT networking technologies to remotely perform and
   communicate IV curves from individual modules or strings in a remote
   facility. A prototype was implemented and used to evaluate soiling loss
   in Sharjah, UAE, over the period of two months under harsh summer
   weather conditions. The prototype was able to successfully and reliably
   collect IV tracing and communicate it back to a cloud-based server for
   researchers to view and analyze. The obtained results show that soiling
   has a major impact on PV modules efficiency with up to 40 \% power loss
   after two months of soiling. The PV soiling index and PV soiling loss
   are evaluated to allow solar facility operators to reduce cleaning
   costs, optimize power output, and enable preventative maintenance in
   city-wide distributed solar facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Open source hardware has developed rapidly since the last 2 decades,
   thanks to access to Internet and availability of novel interactive
   manufacturing technologies (for example 3D printing or collaborative
   platforms). Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH.
   Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388-393, 2018) defined the
   ``open-o-meter{''}, i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of
   an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product
   openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines
   on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of
   documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are
   relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH
   project's process openness by identifying different types of
   collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects'
   process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for
   example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that
   the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score
   of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures
   correctly an OSH project's process openness. This research not only
   validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an
   OSH project's process openness that might be very useful for companies
   to evaluate potential collaborations.}},

Title = {{Towards national policy for open source hardware research: The case of
   Finland}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{155}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Free and open-source hardware (FOSH) is rapidly gaining momentum because
   it provides customized research hardware with over 90\% savings compared
   to the costs of proprietary tools. However, the focused skill sets of
   researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH
   complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an
   interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain
   large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most
   expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development
   funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper
   provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of
   applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation.
   The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate
   Finland's science funders could save between 2.84-27.7m(sic)/year
   directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is
   converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the
   well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation
   within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for
   determining national research policy in hardware development is derived
   and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and
   greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed.}},

Title = {{Electrocatalytic (bio)platforms for the determination of tetracyclines}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY}},
Abstract = {{Due to their widespread use in veterinary medicine, the presence of
   tetracyclines (TCs) and their metabolites in foodstuffs from treated
   animal represents a growing concern for human health and nutrition and,
   therefore, many countries have established maximum levels for their
   presence in foods. The compliance with these legislations requires
   sensitive and selective methods for the determination of this
   antibiotics' family in different matrices. In this sense,
   electrochemical sensors and biosensors are competitive methodologies
   versus other approaches commonly used for this purpose such as
   chromatography and ELISA methods, mainly in terms of low-cost equipment,
   minimal sample treatment, reduced turnaround time, and compatibility
   with multiplexed and point-of-care determinations. With this background
   in mind, this article reviews in a general but comprehensive way recent
   contributions of electrochemical (bio)sensors developed for the
   determination of TCs and applied to TC analysis in environmental
   samples, food, and biological matrices. The highlighted representative
   methods show the key role played both by the materials (mostly
   nanomaterials and polymers) employed to impart surface electrocatalytic
   properties and significant signal amplification, and by different
   (bio)receptors to provide electrochemical sensing with the sensitivity
   and selectivity demanded by the determination of TCs in environmental,
   clinical, and food samples. Main challenges to overcome and future
   prospects to turn over all the benefits of these simple, rapid,
   sensitive, selective, and cost effective electroanalytical (bio)tools in
   single or multiplexed TCs analysis, even at decentralized settings and
   after minimal sample treatment, are also pointed out.}},

Title = {{Design and control of an exoskeleton robot with EMG-driven electrical
   stimulation for upper limb rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL ROBOT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH AND
   APPLICATION}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to design and develop a new robotic device
   for the rehabilitation of the upper limbs. The authors are focusing on a
   new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper
   limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically
   extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm.
   The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor
   rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical
   stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced
   depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges
   two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical
   stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches.
   Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through
   endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed
   approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and
   pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG)
   muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control
   architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the
   appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The
   system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the
   manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures
   traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status
   monitoring report.
   Findings
   The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The
   presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated
   with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The
   integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical
   rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for
   neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator
   is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief,
   massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the
   physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the
   stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time.
   Research limitations/implications
   There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as
   the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of
   professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated
   algorithms for signal extraction.
   Practical implications
   Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation
   are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke
   rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the
   rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people
   with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for
   recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the
   idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation
   based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to
   further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this
   type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance
   devices.
   Originality/value
   The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering
   all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the
   developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open
   source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and
   developments.
   Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and
   restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the
   proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The
   novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical
   stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to show that a significant increase of the
   efficiency of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) can be achieved already at
   an early design stage, through the choice of a turbine and control
   regulation, by means of an accurate Wave-to-Wire (W2W) modeling that
   couples the hydrodynamic response calibrated in a wave flume to a
   Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) test bench with sizes and rates not matching
   those of the system under development. Information on this procedure is
   relevant to save time, because the acquisition, the installation, and
   the setup of a test rig are not quick and easy. Moreover, power
   electronics and electric machines to emulate turbines and electric
   generators matching the real systems are not low-cost equipment. The use
   of HIL is important in the development of WECs also because it allows
   the carrying out of tests in a controlled environment, and this is again
   time- and money-saving if compared to tests done on a real system
   installed at the sea. Furthermore, W2W modeling can be applied to
   several Power Take-Off (PTO) configurations to experiment different
   control strategies. The method here proposed, concerning a specific HIL
   for testing power electronics and control laws for a specific WECs, may
   have a more general validity.}},

Abstract = {{The development of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has been a
   revolution for developmental biology as it allows long-term imaging
   during embryonic development. An important reason behind the quick
   adoption has been the availability of open hardware alternatives. In
   this work, we present a robust and compact version of a light-sheet
   fluorescence microscope that is easy to assemble and requires little to
   no maintenance. An important aspect of the design is that the
   illumination unit consists of reflective elements, thereby reducing
   chromatic aberrations an order of magnitude as compared to refractive
   counterparts. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper fractional Hindmarsh Rose (HR) neuron, which mimics
   several behaviors of a real biological neuron is implemented on field
   programmable gate array (FPGA). The results show several differences in
   the dynamic characteristics of integer and fractional order Hindmarsh
   Rose neuron models. The integer order model shows only one type of
   firing characteristics when the parameters of model remains same. The
   fractional order model depicts several dynamical behaviors even for the
   same parameters as the order of the fractional operator is varied. The
   firing frequency increases when the order of the fractional operator
   decreases. The fractional order is therefore key in determining the
   firing characteristics of biological neurons. To implement this neuron
   model first the digital realization of different fractional operator
   approximations are obtained, then the fractional integrator is used to
   obtain the low power and low cost hardware realization of fractional HR
   neuron. The fractional neuron model has been implemented on a low
   voltage and low power circuit and then compared with its integer counter
   part. The hardware is used to demonstrate the different dynamical
   behaviors of fractional HR neuron for different type of approximations
   obtained for fractional operator in this paper. A coupled network of
   fractional order HR neurons is also implemented. The results also show
   that synchronization between neurons increases as long as coupling
   factor keeps on increasing. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the generation and posterior chemometric resolution of
   third-order data, obtained from samples processed by liquid
   chromatography (LC) with online registering of excitation-emission
   fluorescence matrices (EEM) is reported. Samples were instrumentally
   processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional
   reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence
   instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry
   based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual
   fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported
   instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to
   consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel
   Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC)
   strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during
   the computational stages, through the development and implementation of
   smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral
   acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile
   fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from
   samples with one calibrated analyze (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence
   of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the
   original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The
   resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the
   corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest
   that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously
   reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and
   subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful
   with other flow techniques and kinetics.}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Metalloporphyrins are molecules capable of optically sensing targets due
   to their specific reactivity, and mesoporous photonic architectures can
   act as environment-responsive materials. In this work, we used a
   metalloporphyrin, Mn-III meso-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (MP),
   to add a recognition functionality to a mesoporous oxide photonic
   crystal (MOPC) in order to develop a versatile and portable sensing
   device for volatile amines exploiting both the open MOPC pore network
   and the high affinity of volatile amino analytes to the MP. The hybrid
   material MP@MOPC was prepared by immersion of the MOPC, synthesized from
   mesoporous silica and titania layers, in an MP solution. The system was
   characterized by UV-vis absorption and FTIR spectroscopies, and SEM
   microscopy. Sensing of small molecules was tested using ethylenediamine
   (EDA) as a volatile amine model, showing an absorbance increase in the
   MOPC spectral window with promising analytical parameters. The hybrid
   material presents enhanced sensing capabilities compared to the MP or
   MOPC components alone. A prototype device was built, aiming for a future
   design of simple, low-cost equipment, with a light emitting diode and a
   light-dependent resistor, which includes the MP@MOPC sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic biology emerged in the USA and Europe twenty years ago and
   quickly developed innovative research and technology as a result of
   continued funding. Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing
   countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large
   economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to
   boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology
   developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was
   not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching
   and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early ``MIT
   school{''} of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified
   and included society-centered projects, social science studies on
   synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles
   and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working
   groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a
   funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with
   Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented
   open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in
   this growing research and technology network. The first four annual
   TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open
   science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin
   American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and
   human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin
   American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying
   manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may
   be relevant to other developing countries.}},

Title = {{An Integrated Toolbox for the Engagement of Citizens in the Monitoring

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The monitoring of water ecosystems requires consistent and accurate
   sensor measurements, usually provided from traditional in-situ
   environmental monitoring systems. Such infrastructure, however, is
   expensive, hard to maintain and available only in limited areas that had
   been affected by extreme phenomena and require continuous monitoring.
   Due to climate change, the monitoring of larger areas and extended water
   ecosystems is imperative, raising the question of whether this
   monitoring can be disengaged from the in-situ monitoring systems. Due to
   climate change and extreme weather phenomena, more citizens are affected
   by environmental issues and become aware of the need to contribute to
   their monitoring. As a result, they are willing to offer their time to
   support the collection of scientific data. Collecting such data from
   volunteers, with no technical knowledge and while using low-cost
   equipment such as smart phones and portable sensors, raises the question
   of data quality and consistency. We present here a novel integrated
   toolbox that can support the organization of crowd-sourcing activities,
   ensure the engagement of the participants, the data collection in a
   consistent way, enforce extensive data quality controls and provide to
   local authorities and scientists access to the collected information in
   a uniform way, through widely accepted standards.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new proposal to generate optimal pseudorandom
   numbers with Gaussian distribution. The generator is especially designed
   for low-cost hardware implementation, although the software version is
   also considered. For this reason, Linear Feedback Shift Registers in
   conjunction with cyclic rotations are employed. The proposal presents a
   low implementation cost and overcomes the limitations of the previous
   Gaussian generators based on linear feedback shift registers by means of
   a less complex algorithm to find optimal configurations. As a
   consequence, it turns into a really usable generator. Moreover, a
   further improvement, based on the simulated annealing algorithm, is
   applied in order for the random values to be better adjusted to the
   normal distribution.}},

Abstract = {{With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are
   increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need
   diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the

Abstract = {{Tank-style water heaters provide a critical utility but often waste
   energy, as low temperatures encourage the formation of harmful bacteria.
   We develop low-cost hardware to capture training data from a single
   home's hot water consumption and present a system capable of proactively
   anticipating demand while remaining sensitive to health concerns by
   combining a flow-predictive autoregressive convolutional neural network
   with a Cognitive Supervisor for minimizing Legionella formation. The
   predictive performance is evaluated for different receptive fields, and
   the best-performing model successfully tracks water demand one week into
   the future, providing robust input for the Supervisor to reform
   Legionella growth with minimal energy expenditure. First-order estimates
   find U.S. homeowner savings of \$10B in heating costs and 80MMT of CO2
   without increased health risks. This system uniquely combines predictive
   and protective elements to augment new and incumbent water heater
   installations including those used in low to middle-high income

Abstract = {{The performance assessment of operating photovoltaic modules under real

   low-cost equipment for tracing current-voltage characteristics of
   photovoltaic systems using a relay to connect the operating module under
   test to the varying load, which is a power MOSFET transistor. The new
   developments of this work include the design of an RC circuit to
   generate a steady gate-source voltage amplitude controlled via a PWM
   varying duty cycle. Also, a flexible modular voltage measurement that
   consists of a voltage booster to increase the input voltage capacity of
   the developed curve tracer is proposed. This paper investigated the
   impact of PV module degradations such as discoloration, cell cracks, and
   PID on the I-V curve in the case of crystalline technology and compared
   to similar modules taken as reference.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently proposed approximate median filters (APMFs). They are

   low-cost hardware. In this brief, we develop a specific comparator to
   improve the capabilities of those filters in noise elimination. The
   architecture of our inexact median filters (IMFs) is regular and
   modular. Also, we introduce the histogram-based error dispersion plot as
   a new error evaluation method to have a better assessment of IMF
   performance. Simulation results show that the proposed filter is
   effectively low cost in power, area, and speed. Despite the tradeoff
   between the filtering accuracy and circuit characteristics, the output
   quality of the filter is largely similar to that of the precise one.
   Also, the degradation is almost not noticeable to the human eye.}},

   Thus, they can act as electrochemical sensors to detect bromate.
   Amperometric detection results of NENU-3/CC to bromate show a high
   sensitivity of 45.11 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) and a low detection limit of
   0.55 mu M. Furthermore, NENU-5/CC can exhibit a detection limit of 1.18
   mu M, and a high sensitivity of 18.83 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1). Experimental
   results show that two POMOFs films have high electrochemical stability
   as working electrode materials and good selectivity for detecting
   bromate as sensor materials.
   Novelty statement: Up to now, electrochemical methods to detect bromated
   have attracted considerable attention due to their simplicity, rapidity,
   high sensitivity, excellent selectivity and environmentally friendliness
   with low-cost equipment compared with other techniques. Polyoxometalates
   (POMs) have been widely used for the electrocatalytic reduction of
   bromate because of their high redox properties. However, when POMs are
   used as conductive electrodes materials, they dissolve easily in the
   electrolyte, and the instability of POMs can increase performance
   degradation. For solving the above-mentioned problem, POMs are
   encapsulated into MOFs to generate POM-based MOFs (POMOFs), it combine
   the merits of POMs and MOFs and increase the stability of skeleton.
   However, POMOFs materials can increase the reversible electrochemical
   capacity, the leaching and dispersity of POMOFs in the electrocatalytic
   measurement can make them unstable, and it hinders the conductivity in
   electrochemical behaviors. Thus, Proper POMOFs films have been developed
   to overcome the aforementioned difficulties by packing POMOFs on the
   conductive substrates uniformly to increase the stability and
   performance in electrochemical catalysis.
   In this paper, two electroactive polyoxometalates (POMs)-based
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) films (NENU-3 and NENU-5) were chosen as
   target materials in the synthesis of POMOFs film. And they were located
   on the surface of the carbon cloth through a facile in situ one-step
   solvothermal method as conductive electrode materials. According to
   report, NENU-3 and NENU-5 were coated on the substrate using
   hot-pressing and electrochemical method, we firstly prepared NENU-3/CC
   and NENU-5/CC films by in situ one-step solvothermal method, and the
   as-synthesized POMOFs materials using this method are more uniform,
   facile, and stable than other methods. The results of amper-ometric
   detection of NENU-3/CC to bromate show a wide linear range of 5-560 mu M
   with a high sensitivity of 45.11 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) and a low detection
   limit of 0.55 mu M. Furthermore, NENU-5/CC can exhibit a good linearity
   range of 15-380 mu M, a detection limit of 1.18 mu M, and a high
   sensitivity of 18.83 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1). As a result, the amperometric
   determination demonstrates that two as-synthesized POMOFs/CC films as
   working electrodematerials exhibit good sensitivity, selectivity, and
   stability to detect bromate as sensor materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The design of markerless systems to reconstruct human motion in a
   timely, unobtrusive and externally valid manner is still an open
   challenge. Artificial intelligence algorithms based on automatic
   landmarks identification on video images opened to a new approach,
   potentially e-viable with low-cost hardware. OpenPose is a library that
   t using a two-branch convolutional neural network allows for the
   recognition of skeletons in the scene. Although OpenPose-based solutions
   are spreading, their metrological performances relative to video setup
   are still largely unexplored. This paper aimed at validating a
   two-cameras OpenPose-based markerless system for gait analysis,
   considering its accuracy relative to three factors: cameras' relative
   distance, gait direction and video resolution. Two volunteers performed
   a walking test within a gait analysis laboratory. A marker-based optical
   motion capture system was taken as a reference. Procedures involved:
   calibration of the stereoscopic system; acquisition of video recordings,
   simultaneously with the reference marker-based system; video processing
   within OpenPose to extract the subject's skeleton; videos
   synchronization; triangulation of the skeletons in the two videos to
   obtain the 3D coordinates of the joints. Two set of parameters were
   considered for the accuracy assessment: errors in trajectory
   reconstruction and error in selected gait space-temporal parameters
   (step length, swing and stance time). The lowest error in trajectories
   (20 mm) was obtained with cameras 1.8 m apart, highest resolution and
   straight gait, and the highest (60 mm) with the 1.0 m, low resolution
   and diagonal gait configuration. The OpenPose-based system tended to
   underestimate step length of about 1.5 cm, while no systematic biases
   were found for swing/stance time. Step length significantly changed
   according to gait direction (p = 0.008), camera distance (p = 0.020),
   and resolution (p < 0.001). Among stance and swing times, the lowest
   errors (0.02 and 0.05 s for stance and swing, respectively) were
   obtained with the 1 m, highest resolution and straight gait
   configuration. These findings confirm the feasibility of tracking
   kinematics and gait parameters of a single subject in a 3D space using
   two low-cost webcams and the OpenPose engine. In particular, the
   maximization of cameras distance and video resolution enabled to achieve
   the highest metrological performances.}},

Abstract = {{Background Reach-grasp movements are motor components commonly affected
   after stroke and directly related to the independence of these
   individuals. Evaluations of these activities can be performed using
   clinical instruments and assessed by detailed and costly kinematic
   analyses. The aim of this study was to develop an analysis of
   reach-grasp movements in post-stroke patients using a simple,
   inexpensive, and manageable instrument. Results A Mann-Whitney test was
   used to compare paretic and non-paretic limb motor performance. A
   statistically significant difference was found between the variables of
   total time (p = 0.02) and speed to reach target 3 (p = 0.04) for task 1,
   while in task 2 significance was found only in the aspect of speed to
   reach target 2 (p = 0.04). The correlation between clinical tests and
   variables of tasks was then performed using Spearman's rank correlation
   coefficient. At task 1, when compared with the REACH instrument, the
   close target sub-item; there was a high positive correlation between the
   parameters of total time (p = 0.028), target velocity 3 (p = 0.028), and
   target acceleration 3 (p = 0.028). Another instrument that showed a high
   positive correlation with the target time 3 (p = 0.01) and target
   acceleration 3 (p = 0.028) variables was the Box and Block Test. When
   correlated, the data between the task 2 variables and clinical
   instruments did not present statistically significant data. Conclusion
   Our instrument-the Temporal Data Acquisition Instrument-TDAI-fulfilled
   the expected objectives and can be used as an option to evaluate the
   movements of reach and grasp of upper limb post-stroke, using an easy
   and fast application, without the need for calibration. Trial

Title = {{Wireless sensor network for estimating building performance}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Accurate building energy assessments are often limited by inaccurate
   assumptions about the buildings' properties and occupant behavior. Many
   assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it
   is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date,
   on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the
   design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to
   program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN
   presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and
   return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the
   radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil
   flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The
   modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new
   types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is
   streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements
   in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are
   intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The
   current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The
   observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute
   sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7
   min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost
   of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment
   in an occupied building.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF
   educational robot manipulator with a gripper. The robot is upgraded by
   providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and
   shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware
   solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through
   a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through
   five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder
   signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with
   anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state
   observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture
   Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical
   encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as
   well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to
   interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino
   boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the
   Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a
   trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with
   other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments
   presented in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in
   mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
   (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
   can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion,
   accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing
   exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and
   unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer
   can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present
   VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite
   aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment,
   integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS
   provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle
   to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU
   featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent
   and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of
   cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The
   synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple
   experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore,
   the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in
   multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera
   applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based
   mapping.}},

Title = {{Lightweight sustainable intelligent load forecasting platform for smart

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS \& SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{With the global electricity demand witnessing a 3.1 percent jump in
   2017, there is an increasing need for incorporating intermittent
   renewable energy sources and other alternative supply/demand management
   strategies into the supply grid networks. Short-term load forecasting
   models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby
   encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power
   sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and
   sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers
   must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the
   quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power
   of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting
   electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent
   Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on
   implementing standard regression and machine learning-based
   architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of
   the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by
   means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to
   be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance
   of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the
   device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error
   percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource
   utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some
   specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for
   the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The attitude control using reaction wheels as actuators has been one of
   the most popular ways to stabilize and repel external disturbances in
   aerospace devices. From the controlled change of the angular momentum
   rate of change using reaction wheels, it is possible to control the
   oscillation and direction rates of change of rigid bodies in space.
   Thus, the main idea of this article is to present a case study with
   different configurations of the well-known reaction wheel pendulum. The
   first is based on the classical configuration, and the second, a new
   one, a pendulum with two reaction wheels. For both configurations,
   proportional-integral-derivative controllers were designed and
   experimental devices were built to perform real-time controllers using
   low-cost hardware. The simulated and experimental results have shown
   that the pendulums were controlled using a simple controller in the
   inverted position and the results were satisfactory. Four performance
   indices were calculated to evaluate the results for each configuration.
   They showed that the pendulum with two reaction wheels worked better
   than the pendulum with one reaction wheel. Two actuators made it easier
   to move and control the pendulum in the inverted position.}},

Abstract = {{An open-source syringe pump has been developed for use in the analytical
   laboratory. Most pump parts are made on a 3D printer. Other parts (lead
   screw, guide rods, stepper motor, bearings, electronic components) are
   purchased in specialized stores. The control panel is based on the
   Arduino UNO. Device interaction, any settings changes, and operating
   mode selection are carried out using the LCD Keypad Shield (no computer
   connection required). The program for the microcontroller is written in
   Arduino IDE. Assembling the syringe pump takes several hours and
   requires almost no soldering. Universal clamp allows installing any
   syringe with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm. The syringe pump can both infuse
   the liquid and refill the empty syringe. To evaluate the analytical
   characteristics, a 10-mL glass syringe (Kloehn) was used. The dispensed
   volume was 1 and 5 mL. The systematic error was less than 0.1\%, and the
   random one was less than 3 mu L. Project files are available at:

Title = {{Environmental monitoring in a poultry farm using an instrument developed

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Animal welfare is a major concern these days, as well as the factors
   that have impact on animal productivity. Constant monitoring of
   environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, levels of
   ammonia and luminosity is crucial because these variables directly
   impact poultry performance and welfare. Along these lines, it is
   necessary to look for solutions that allow the monitoring of these
   variables in a practical, reliable and cheap way. In the agribusiness,
   the scenario for the IoT (Internet of Things) is very promising, because
   it has emerged to fill this gap and deliver sensed data, widely
   increasing the connectivity of the devices. Therefore, this paper
   describes a low cost, hardware and software proposal for monitoring
   these environmental parameters in poultry farms. In addition,
   experiments were done to compare the proposed prototype with commercial
   devices. The measured variables showed a correlation above 0.90 between
   the sensors used in the prototype and the calibrated equipment, also
   having the cost of only 13\% of that of the conventional equipment. The
   prototype displayed favorable results, indicating that its
   implementation is viable.}},

Abstract = {{The founding of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) vision was
   originally presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1188 (U.S.
   Geological Survey {[}USGS], 1999), after many years of discussions and
   workshops, described in detail by Filson and Arabasz (2016). Much has
   been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes
   divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual
   private and public universities were finally centralized with increased
   efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to
   ``... provide accurate and timely data and information products for
   seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures,
   employing modern monitoring methods and technologies.{''} In this
   article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any
   way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and
   ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international
   collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses
   an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework
   can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems.
   This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics,
   including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a
   self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph
   system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic
   (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores.}},

Title = {{Synchronization of Hindmarsh Rose Neurons}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{372-380}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Modeling and implementation of biological neurons are key to the
   fundamental understanding of neural network architectures in the brain
   and its cognitive behavior. Synchronization of neuronal models play a
   significant role in neural signal processing as it is very difficult to
   identify the actual interaction between neurons in living brain.
   Therefore, the synchronization study of these neuronal architectures has
   received extensive attention from researchers. Higher biological
   accuracy of these neuronal units demands more computational overhead and
   requires more hardware resources for implementation. This paper presents
   a two coupled hardware implementation of Hindmarsh Rose neuron model
   which is mathematically simpler model and yet mimics several behaviors
   of a real biological neuron. These neurons are synchronized using an
   exponential function. The coupled system shows several behaviors
   depending upon the parameters of HR model and coupling function. An
   approximation of coupling function is also provided to reduce the
   hardware cost. Both simulations and a low cost hardware implementations
   of exponential synaptic coupling function and its approximation are
   carried out for comparison. Hardware implementation on field
   programmable gate array (FPGA) of approximated coupling function shows
   that the coupled network produces different dynamical behaviors with
   acceptable error. Hardware implementation shows that the approximated
   coupling function has significantly lower implementation cost. A spiking
   neural network based on HR neuron is also shown as a practical
   application of this coupled HR neural networks. The spiking network
   successfully encodes and decodes a time varying input. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Conventional track circuit condition monitoring systems are fixed at the
   wayside, with each installation reporting on a single track circuit. In
   this work, we present a custom-built, sensitive, magnetic field
   detection system, which can be fitted to the underside of a rail
   vehicle. With this system installed, some characteristics of an
   operating track circuit can be monitored from the vehicle whilst it is
   in motion. By using appropriate analysis techniques, it is possible to
   identify the signatures of equipment relating to audio frequency track
   circuits, the topic of this work. Analysing the signatures of track
   circuit equipment demonstrated that there were clear differences between
   track circuit assets. By building on other research into the behaviours
   of failing track circuits, and continuing to conduct this research, the
   authors believe that it is possible, and beneficial, to perform
   condition monitoring of track circuits from low-cost equipment mounted
   on the train. Coupling this with advanced analysis techniques will allow
   predictive maintenance of track circuits with very little capital
   outlay.}},

Abstract = {{Here, pulsed plasma nitriding of AISI-316L austenite stainless steel is
   conducted in a narrow range of temperature 510-550 degrees C and
   simultaneous combination of expanded austenite phase, and homogenous,
   dense chromium nitride phase is attained in a single processing unit,
   with relative low-cost equipment and single-step processing. The results
   show a noteworthy enhancement in nanohardness at 530 degrees C, whereas
   best wear resistance is achieved by processing at 550 degrees C. A
   dual-layer structure is obtained constituted of expanded austenite phase
   covered by quite homogenous chromium nitride phase, which is probably
   responsible for the dramatic surface improvement. The wear mechanism is
   changed after plasma processing (abrasive to adhesive wear), and the
   friction coefficient is reduced and smoother, particularly for the
   sample treated at 530 degrees C. Interestingly, the corrosion resistance
   is also found to be enhanced, even in the presence of chromium nitride
   (which usually deteriorate the corrosion resistance), which is probably
   credited to the formation of fine-grained and homogeneous CrN layer over
   the expanded austenite phase. This study suggests that the development
   of homogenous CrN layer over the expanded austenite structure is highly
   valuable for mechanical and tribological features, and it enhances the
   corrosion resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The eye tracking field is an area highly studied by different
   researchers. In addition, there are companies that offer commercial eye
   trackers, but they are usually economically restrictive. However,
   current technology allows to design embedded eye tracking systems,
   capable of running on low-cost hardware. This paper presents the
   implementation of a real-time eye-detection method that uses the
   properties of ``isophotes{''}, to achieve robustness against changes in
   illumination, eye rotation and pupil size. The method is implemented in
   a portable platform, reduced both in computing power and in RAM memory.
   The performance is evaluated using different eye tracking methods
   implemented by the authors on the same platform. For this purpose, a
   database generated on this hardware is used. This database is composed
   of a set of low-resolution near-infrared eyes-images created with the
   dark pupil technique, using a lightweight glasses head unit. Results
   show the robustness of the method and a significant accuracy improvement

   point of reflection wave}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Traveling wave reflection method is widely used in cable length
   measurement and fault location. How to effectively remove noise
   interference and accurately identify the starting point of pulse
   reflection is the key problem to be solved by this method. In this
   paper, two new methods, the improved weighted coefficient method based
   on the wavelet theory and the curve fitting method, are proposed for
   different identification accuracy and velocity by analyzing the measured
   reflected wave signal. The improved weighted coefficient method was used
   to process the traditional denoising threshold with the same value of
   +/- thr, and then the calculated weighted threshold was used to reduce
   the noise of the measured signal, so as to highlight and identify the
   starting point of reflection pulse. The curve fitting method is adopted
   to compare the reflected wave anomaly with the threshold value of the
   corresponding length cable. If the threshold value is exceeded, the
   fault reflection can be judged as fault reflection. Then the quadratic
   function fitting is carried out here, and the starting point of the
   reflected pulse is directly determined by using the intersection point
   of the quadratic curve and the reference voltage. The experimental and
   simulation results show that the improved weighted coefficient method
   solves the problems of unsmoothness of denoising and discontinuity of
   derivative of denoising function, improves the accuracy of identifying
   the starting point of reflection wave, provides a new algorithm for
   improving the measurement accuracy. The curve fitting method has high
   speed, low demand for hardware, and the error can be controlled within
   10ns, which is more suitable for low-cost equipment based on
   Microcontrollers.}},

Title = {{Exploratory Research of CO2, Noise and Metabolic Energy Expenditure in
   Lisbon Commuting}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The lower cost of sensors is making possible the acquisition of big data
   sets in several applications and research areas. Indoor air quality and
   commuter exposure to pollutants are some of these areas, which can have
   impacts on our livelihood. The main objective of this exploratory
   research was to assemble portable equipment along with a prototype, one
   low-cost and easy to replicate in any location worldwide. We answer how
   CO2, noise and energy expenditure compare in different transportation
   modes with indoor environments (metro, bus and car). It was intended to
   be carried by a subject on all commutes. The low-cost equipment
   assembled has the ability to measure ambient CO2, noise levels, heart
   rate and geographic coordinates. The field campaign was conducted on an
   urban commuting route, in Lisbon city, between Rossio (downtown of
   Lisbon city) and Campo Grande (near FCUL campus). It took place during 3
   weeks in school break and 3 weeks in the school period to grasp some
   differences between these periods of the year. The heart rate data was
   used to calculate the subject energy expenditure and the geographic
   coordinate data allowed for time and spatial analysis using a geospatial
   software package. Our measurements totaled 70 one-way trips and 358,140
   data points. Temporal and spatial analysis yielded the following
   results: The metro presents the lowest median CO2 concentrations of 693
   ppm and the bus the highest with 1085 ppm. The bus had an equivalent
   continuous sound average (L-eq) of 75 dBA, while the metro had 85.2 dBA.
   Based on the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) calculations, the metro
   displays the least sedentary behavior, while the bus presents the most
   sedentary behavior with up to 96.5\% of its commute spent in this
   classification. The metro was the fastest mode of transportation based
   on the consistency of its travel times compared to the bus, which
   despite also being consistent, was slower by 1.8 times. The car
   measurement values reside in the middle of the metro and bus results.
   Despite this, it is considered the worst mode of transportation, as it
   goes against the idea of a less congested and clean city. It also has a
   highly variable commuting time, which sometimes makes it slower than the
   metro, especially during the school period. According to our results, we
   concluded that the metro had efficient indoor ventilation while the bus
   did not. There were several instances of inefficient ventilation with
   concentrations exceeding 1000 ppm, particularly between Restauradores
   and Saldanha due to overcrowding. Referring to the health impacts of
   noise, the metro dBA levels are not sustained for enough time to have
   any measurable negative impact. Sensor performance was considered
   acceptable for the CO2 sensor. The dBA and heart rate (HR) sensors were
   considered acceptable to sometimes irregular in nature, which was
   expected and taken into consideration.}},

Abstract = {{The five-level nested neutral-point-pilot (NPP) topology, as a new
   structure for converters, bears the advantages of a high power density,
   robustness, and flexibility and is therefore suitable for high-voltage
   and high-power applications. For a multilevel converter, as the number
   of power electronic switches increases, the risk of switch failure
   increases, together with the complexity of fault detection and tolerance
   control. The requirements for a higher operational stability and
   reliability continue to grow. However, studies on fault tolerance for
   multilevel converters are limited. In this paper, a fault diagnosis and
   tolerance solution for a fivelevel nested NPP converter is proposed. For
   the fault diagnosis, a deep learning method integrating the wavelet
   packet transform and long short-term memory is presented. Both open- and
   shortcircuit switch failures can be precisely detected and located
   without the requirement of a large sample set. Two software-based
   control strategies for fault tolerance are adopted, and low-cost
   hardware reconfigurations are also implemented to prevent failure
   expansion and ensure continuous operation. Furthermore, the voltages of
   dclink capacitors and flying capacitors are effectively balanced with
   the improved algorithm even when a failure occurs. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the fault-tolerant strategy are proven by simulations
   and experiments.}},

   present an energy-efficient STDP based sparse coding processor. The
   low-cost hardware is based on the algorithmic reduction techniques as
   following: First, the complex WTA operation is simplified based on the
   prediction of spike emitting neurons. Sparsity based approximation in
   spatial and temporal domain are also efficiently exploited to remove the
   redundant neurons with negligible algorithmic accuracy loss. We designed
   and implemented the hardware of the STDP based sparse coding using 65nm
   CMOS process. By exploiting input sparsity, the proposed SNN
   architecture can dynamically trade off algorithmic quality for
   computation energy (up to 74\%) for Natural image (maximum 0.01 RMSE
   increment) and MNIST (no accuracy loss) applications. In the inference
   mode of operations, the SNN hardware achieves the throughput of 374
   Mpixels/s and 840.2 GSOP/s with the energy-efficiency of 781.52 pJ/pixel
   and 0.35 pJ/SOP.}},

Abstract = {{Background: GeoInformation, is very valuable for a range of fields
   ranging from location based services and navigation to smart cities and
   homes. On the other hand today many fields benefit from Internet of
   Things (IoT) implementations, where the machine-to-machine and
   machine-to-human transmission of GeoInformation frequently occurs. This
   transmission usually occurs in multi-source/multi-target and
   multi-platform IoT environments. Problem Statement: In many cases
   real-time GeoInformation stays in its own island of automation, and thus
   its real value cannot be uncovered. This happens mainly due to
   inefficiencies and problems that occur in the storage, sharing and
   exchange of real-time GeoInformation as a result of
   multi-source/multi-target and multi-platform nature of the IoT
   architectures. Research Approach: Integration appears as a critical
   paradigm which should be focused in order to store, manage and transfer
   of GeoInformation efficiently in these complex environments. In this
   context, the focus of the study was to test the applicability of
   different technologies and integration methods for acquisition,
   transmission and visualisation of multi-source GeoInformation through
   implementing an IoT Integration Testbed Architecture which is utilizing
   low-cost hardware (to acquire information), graph databases(to store
   information) and standard IoT protocols (to exchange information). The
   implementation explained in this paper covers acquisition of real time
   GeoInformation from a set of real and virtual sensors, storage of this
   GeoInformation in Graph Databases, exchange of information through two
   different communication models (request/response and publish/subscribe)
   based on standard IoT protocols, and visualization of information by web
   pages, web mapping services and using a GIS software. Results: The
   implementation results demonstrated a proof-of-concept on how
   multi-source GeoInformation acquired from different type of IoT nodes
   can be integrated, stored and visualised on different platforms by
   utilising a standard IoT communication paradigms and multiple
   communication models.}},

Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological
   samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE),
   can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs
   of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE
   images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples.
   Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can
   also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the
   TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained
   OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct
   amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging
   as a method of discrimination between different algal species and,
   potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL.
   Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences
   are suggested.}},

   Beside a linear actuator motion system, a force sensor system and a

   various low-cost hardware components of the Arduino platform are used,
   which support the deployment of the controller software based on
   Matlab-Simulink. The remaining image motion is measured with a

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cells in the central
   nervous system (CNS). These non-neuronal cells are able to regulate the
   neurons activity in the different parts of brain tissue by calcium waves
   generation in its internal space. Moreover, astrocytes interact with
   neurons and modulate the spiking activity of them. In this paper, a set
   of piecewise linear estimations of a three-dimensional spontaneous
   astrocyte model are presented for digital FPGA realization. This leads
   to achieve a high-speed and low-cost system in large-scale
   implementation. In this approach, the three-dimensional original model
   is converted to a two-dimensional one and the hardware overhead have
   been reduced, significantly due to eliminating the large number of
   multiplications in the original astrocyte model. Simulation results in
   MATLAB demonstrate that our method can mimic the original calcium waves
   in high degree of similarity. To validate our method in case of
   hardware, the proposed model has been tested and simulated in Modelsim
   software and also implemented on Spartan3 XC3S50 (TQ144) FPGA board.
   Hardware realization results show that the proposed model has high
   similarity by the simulation outputs. Consequently, this reduced-model
   of astrocyte can be used in large-scale networks because of its low-cost
   hardware and high-speed system.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing demand for automatic management of agricultural production
   and real-time remote monitoring has increased the need for smart
   devices, wireless technologies, and sensors. The internet of things
   (IoT) has emerged as a common technology for the management of multiple
   devices by multiple users. Some professional solutions are relatively
   difficult to implement for researchers who are interested in
   agricultural IoT but do not have requisite skills in computers and
   electronics. The unfriendliness of the user software limits the
   practical application of agricultural IoT in China. This article
   presents a simple solution based on an SoC (system-on-chip) and We Chat
   mini-program that focuses on low-cost hardware, rapid development,
   user-friendly application design, and helping developers get a quick
   start in building a DIY monitoring system. The ESP8266, a
   high-performance SoC, is used as the microcontroller and Wi-Fi module to
   transfer the sensor data to a remote server. A We Chat mini-program
   provides the graphical user interface, enabling users to manage devices
   and access data by clicking. Users can log into the system using their
   We Chat accounts and bind devices by scanning QR codes on the devices.
   Thus, the complex management and device binding in conventional systems
   can be overcome. The system is easy to be expand and has great potential
   for greenhouse environmental monitoring in China.}},

Journal = {{HOLOS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The study proposes the use of a microcontroller to carry out the shading
   board project based on the Arduino platform. For this, a light sensor
   (LDR lOnnnn) is used to provide the inclination about the sun's rays, so
   that the microcontroller used is capable of tracking the sun to study
   the effects of such tracking on the efficiency in capturing the sun's
   rays, thus generating an electrical signal directly to the person
   responsible for the microcontroller. A mechanism is proposed that has
   its orientation based on the maximum incidence of solar rays on the
   surface of the solar cell, thus making the directional alignment with
   the photovoltaic plate at an angle with azimuth and height of the direct
   sun with the intensity of solar radiation. For this, two servomotors are
   used and with the inclination that can vary in the two axes: North /
   South and East / West. In addition to the servomotors, a microcontroller
   was used. The shading plate forms a rectangle, due to the position of
   the four light sensors, to control components directly connected to the
   servomotors. The embedded software is made by algorithms that allow the
   microcontroller to determine the correct position of the prototype solar
   panel. Initially, the characteristics of the proposed system are
   described and, using this apparatus, it is expected to generate
   electrical energy and increase the power in capturing with low-cost
   equipment.}},

   continuous genetic algorithm}},
Journal = {{COGENT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Algorithms used for day ahead generation scheduling are crucial for a
   power system operator to balance conflicting objectives and the network
   constraints. Practically feasible algorithms using parallel computing,
   low-cost hardware and open-source software in power system parlance are
   rarely attempted in the literature. In this paper, a multicore
   processing-based genetic algorithm is proposed for finding the optimum
   solution of economic emission dispatch considering the reliability
   indices. Continuous genetic algorithm is used to improve the speed of
   the algorithm. Cost minimization and emission minimization are
   considered as the objectives to find the set of pareto-optimal
   solutions. The final solution is selected from the pareto-optimal set
   based on the reliability of generating stations. The insight used to
   improve the search space is the usage of two cores of a dual core
   processor in parallel, with different parameters of genetic algorithm.
   The constraints are handled using repair function and penalty factors,
   based on the feasibility of implementation. The algorithm is tested on
   IEEE 30 Bus, 6 generator system and IEEE 57 Bus system. The results show
   that the multicore processing using different parameters of genetic
   algorithm has improved the performance.}},

Title = {{A Low-Cost, Portable Solution for Stress and Relaxation Estimation Based
   on a Real-Time Fuzzy Algorithm}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{74118-74128}},
Abstract = {{<italic>Goal</italic>: This paper proposes a reliable stress and
   relaxation level estimation algorithm that is implemented in a portable,
   low-cost hardware device and executed in real time. The main objective
   of this work is to offer an affordable and \& x201C;ready-to-go \&
   x201D; solution for medical and personal environments, in which the
   detection of the arousal level of a person is crucial.
   <italic>Methods</italic>: To achieve meaningful identification of stress
   and relaxation, a fuzzy algorithm based on expert knowledge is built
   according to parameters extracted from physiological records. In
   addition to the heart rate, parameters extracted from the galvanic skin
   response and breath are employed to extend the results. Moreover, this
   algorithm achieves accurate results with a restricted computational load
   and can be implemented in a miniaturized low-cost prototype. The
   developed solution includes standard and actively shielded electrodes
   that are connected to an Arduino device for acquisition, while parameter
   extraction and fuzzy processing are conducted with a more powerful
   Raspberry Pi board. The proposed solution is validated using real
   physiological registers from 42 subjects collected using BIOPAC MP36
   hardware. Additionally, a real-time acquisition, processing and remote
   cloud storage service is integrated via IoT wireless technology.
   <italic>Results</italic>: Robust identification of stress and relaxation
   is achieved, with F1 scores of 91.15 \& x0025; and 96.61 \& x0025;,
   respectively. Moreover, processing is performed using a 20-second
   sliding window; thus, only a small frame of context is required.
   <italic>Significance</italic>: This work presents a reliable solution
   for identifying stress and relaxation levels in real time, which can
   lead to the production of low-cost commercial devices for use in medical
   and personal environments.}},

Title = {{Inverted Pendulum Nonlinear Controllers Using Two Reaction Wheels:
   Design and Implementation}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{74922-74932}},
Abstract = {{Reaction wheels have been extensively used to control and stabilize a
   wide range of applications due to the angular momentum exchange that
   they provide to mechanical systems. However, there exist several
   limitations associated with actuator saturation and the presence of
   singularities that lead towards the use of different controllers and
   devices. Recently, a new and unusual configuration using two reaction
   wheels was proposed and illustrated in an inverted pendulum to drive and
   control it using a simple and well-known PID controller. In this
   context, this paper improves the previous results on the same system by
   proposing two more sophisticated nonlinear controllers: a nonlinear
   proportional-derivative and a sliding mode controller. The proof of the
   stability of each controller is also provided, and the asymptotic
   stability is proven. A friction model is experimentally updated into the
   differential equations of the pendulum and also included for the
   controllers designing. A real-time application verifies the performance
   of the controllers using low-cost hardware. Results based on the
   analysis of different performance indices highlight the improvement of
   applying these two nonlinear control techniques comparing to the
   previous paper using this configuration of actuators.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an open source hardware platform called Blinky, a
   sound-to-light conversion sensor that harvests sound power at low-rate

   connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are
   powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure. Distributed
   in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to
   practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We
   give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential
   applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We
   provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and
   signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially
   affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a
   calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The
   effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment. Finally,
   we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual
   Blinkies in highly reverberent environment.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{10433-10442}},
Abstract = {{The internet of things is rapidly becoming a fact of life. There remain,
   however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0
   before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector.
   One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of
   both management and operational technology involving the configuration
   and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating
   equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or
   administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to
   systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper
   presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which
   facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The
   access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and
   management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative
   manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of
   the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
   protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks.
   The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket
   protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in
   this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and
   they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and
   easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access
   from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment
   located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the
   security level set by each individual company.}},

Abstract = {{Open-source designs are being increasingly used to develop robot
   hardware. When motor actuators were used for robot development in the
   past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products.
   Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration
   of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is
   now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is
   cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic
   speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards,
   as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed,
   high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more
   accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control
   algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a
   general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To
   evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC
   was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be
   fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source
   motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis
   robot systems.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of deep learning in low-cost hardware, such as an edge
   device, is challenging. Reducing the complexity of the network is one of
   the solutions to reduce resource usage in the system, which is needed by
   low-cost system implementation. In this study, we use the general
   average pooling layer to replace the fully connected layers on the
   convolutional neural network (CNN) model, used in the previous study, to
   reduce the number of network properties without decreasing the model
   performance in developing image classification for image search tasks.
   We apply the cosine similarity to measure the characteristic similarity
   between the feature vector of image input and extracting feature vectors
   from testing images in the database. The result of the cosine similarity
   calculation will show the image as the result of the searching image
   task. In the implementation, we use Raspberry Pi 3 as a low-cost
   hardware and CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing images. Base on
   the development and implementation, the accuracy of the model is 68\%,
   and the system generates the result of the image search base on the

   Converters Using LabVIEW FPGA}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, the use of the hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation has
   gained popularity among researchers all over the world. One of its main
   applications is the simulation of power electronics converters. However,
   the equipment designed for this purpose is difficult to acquire for some
   universities or research centers, so ad-hoc solutions for the
   implementation of HIL simulation in low-cost hardware for power
   electronics converters is a novel research topic. However, the
   information regarding implementation is written at a high technical
   level and in a specific language that is not easy for non-expert users
   to understand. In this paper, a systematic methodology using LabVIEW
   software (LabVIEW 2018) for HIL simulation is shown. A fast and easy
   implementation of power converter topologies is obtained by means of the
   differential equations that define each state of the power converter.
   Five simple steps are considered: designing the converter, modeling the
   converter, solving the model using a numerical method, programming an
   off-line simulation of the model using fixed-point representation, and
   implementing the solution of the model in a Field-Programmable Gate
   Array (FPGA). This methodology is intended for people with no experience
   in the use of languages as Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware
   Description Language (VHDL) for Real-Time Simulation (RTS) and HIL
   simulation. In order to prove the methodology's effectiveness and
   easiness, two converters were simulated-a buck converter and a
   three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI)-and compared with the
   simulation of commercial software (PSIM (R) v9.0) and a real power
   converter.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to verify whether a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ can be
   utilized as a low-cost device for controlling a tensile-testing device
   used for material research purposes. A list of requirements based on
   already-available hardware was drawn up, which the new control system
   had to fulfil. To connect all the necessary equipment; a connection
   board was constructed, and some additional hardware was acquired for the
   system to be able to perform all the necessary tasks. The whole
   controlling system was also put in a small enclosure to make it
   portable. The control-system software was written in C++ using the
   Pigpio library. The developed system was then tested, and the results
   were compared to a commercialy available Instron 8802 device. A
   comparison of the results shows that the upgraded equipment can produce
   comparable results to commercialy available devices and is sufficiently
   accurate to be applied for research purposes for the characterization of
   soft tissues and other materials.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The micro-turbojet engine (MTE) is especially suitable for unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs). Because the rotor speed is proportional to the
   thrust force, the accurate speed tracking control is indispensable for
   MTE. Thanks to its simplicity, the proportional-integral-derivative
   (PID) controller is commonly used for rotor speed regulation. However,
   the PID controller cannot guarantee superior performance over the entire
   operation range due to the time-variance and strong nonlinearity of MTE.
   The gain scheduling approach using a family of linear controllers is
   recognized as an efficient alternative, but such a solution heavily
   relies on the model sets and pre-knowledge. To tackle such challenges, a
   single neural adaptive PID (SNA-PID) controller is proposed herein for
   rotor speed control. The new controller featuring with a single-neuron
   network is able to adaptively tune the gains (weights) online. The
   simple structure of the controller reduces the computational load and
   facilitates the algorithm implementation on low-cost hardware. Finally,
   the proposed controller is validated by numerical simulations and
   experiments on the MTE in laboratory conditions, and the results show
   that the proposed controller achieves remarkable effectiveness for speed
   tracking control. In comparison with the PID controller, the proposed
   controller yields 54\% and 66\% reductions on static tracking error
   under two typical cases.}},

   phenomenon has not been fully explored. Using grounded theory, the
   authors studied 31 firms for an average of 2.3 years, discovering a
   4-phase growth pattern of open source hardware firms, including starting
   the firm, identifying core competencies, business model improvement and
   business maturation. The firms' behaviors in each stage are reported, as
   well as the evolution of community demography, behaviors and impact in
   different growth phases.}},

Abstract = {{The trend of electronic device miniaturization, from the microscale to
   the nanoscale, presents a temperature measurement challenge. The
   available techniques have limitations in terms of either resolution,
   calibration, acquisition time, or equipment cost. Here we demonstrate a
   thermography technique called hyperspectral quantum rod thermal imaging
   (HQTI), which exploits temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL)
   emission of quantum rods to obtain the surface temperature map of a
   biased electronic device, with a straightforward calibration. This
   method uses relatively simple, low-cost equipment, while achieving
   submicrometer spatial resolution. This technique is demonstrated by
   measuring the thermal map of a direct current (dc) operated gallium
   nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), achieving a
   temperature precision of similar to 4 degrees C and an similar to
   700-800 nm estimated lateral optical resolution. This is a versatile
   method for measurement both in submicrometer scale regions of interest
   and of larger areas in the hundreds of micrometers range.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in whole slide imaging (WSI) have moved pathology
   closer to digital practice. Existing systems require precise mechanical
   control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists.
   Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI.
   The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a
   programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer
   numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI
   platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using
   color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we
   perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment
   using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X
   objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of
   similar to 0.7 mu m. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm(2)
   region in similar to 2 mins with throughput comparable to existing
   high-end platforms. The reported system offers a turnkey solution to
   transform the high-end WSI platforms into one that can be made broadly
   available and utilizable without loss of capacity. (C) 2019 Optical

Abstract = {{Open source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) are two expressions of one
   broader concept and its related movement. One of the most fundamental
   questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their
   private resources to these public goods. While this question has been
   discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of
   OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we
   really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be
   the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory
   (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind
   contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common
   and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH
   development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with
   participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of
   different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important
   findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to
   those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities,
   hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all,
   enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting
   contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations,
   expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out.
   Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can
   have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based
   intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models
   throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge
   that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important
   implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms,
   but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in
   open innovation.}},

Journal = {{MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Building novel analytical systems requires various elements: Sensors, a
   sampling system and data evaluation software. For emerging technologies,
   such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a
   functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the
   actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing
   hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal
   restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based
   on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom
   set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate
   the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical
   components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its
   control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement.
   We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry
   imaging: ``LABI-Imaging{''} for synchronizing the robot movements and MS
   data acquisition and ``RmsiGUI{''}, a software solution for the complete
   AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the
   automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a
   PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a
   lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP)
   ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in
   RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released
   under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument
   developers' community.}},

   comparing performance against estimation-theoretic bounds. Our tiled
   architecture is motivated by recent progress in low-cost hardware
   realizations of moderately sized antenna arrays (which play the role of

   OpenSCAD and FreeCAD Python scripts}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Open source hardware for scientific equipment needs to provide source
   files and enough documentation to allow the study, replication and
   modification of the design. In addition, parametric modeling is
   encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments.
   Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows
   customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the
   most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source
   labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard
   parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the
   model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to
   share the design in the most accessible formats with no information
   loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD
   Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design
   to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for
   FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the
   initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to
   standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries;
   and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical
   interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source
   hardware for scientific equipment.}},

Title = {{Proposal for an Embedded System Architecture Using a GNDVI Algorithm to
   Support UAV-Based Agrochemical Spraying}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{An important area in precision agriculture is related to the efficient
   use of chemicals applied onto fields. Efforts have been made to diminish
   their use, aiming at cost reduction and fewer chemical residues in the
   final agricultural products. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   presents itself as an attractive and cheap alternative for spraying
   pesticides and fertilizers compared to conventional mass spraying
   performed by ordinary manned aircraft. Besides being cheaper than manned
   aircraft, small UAVs are capable of performing fine-grained instead of
   the mass spraying. Observing this improved method, this paper reports
   the design of an embedded real-time UAV spraying control system
   supported by onboard image processing. The proposal uses a normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) algorithm to detect the exact
   locations in which the chemicals are needed. Using this information, the
   automated spraying control system performs punctual applications while
   the UAV navigates over the crops. The system architecture is designed to
   run on low-cost hardware, which demands an efficient NDVI algorithm. The
   experiments were conducted using Raspberry Pi 3 as the embedded
   hardware. First, experiments in a laboratory were conducted in which the
   algorithm was proved to be correct and efficient. Then, field tests in
   real conditions were conducted for validation purposes. These validation
   tests were performed in an agronomic research station with the Raspberry
   hardware integrated into a UAV flying over a field of crops. The average
   CPU usage was about 20\% while memory consumption was about 70 MB for
   high definition images, with 4\% CPU usage and 20.3 MB RAM being
   observed for low-resolution images. The average current measured to
   execute the proposed algorithm was 0.11 A. The obtained results prove
   that the proposed solution is efficient in terms of processing and
   energy consumption when used in embedded hardware and provides
   measurements which are coherent with the commercial GreenSeeker
   equipment.}},

Title = {{FAST-FUSION: An Improved Accuracy Omnidirectional Visual Odometry System
   with Sensor Fusion and GPU Optimization for Embedded Low Cost Hardware}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The main task while developing a mobile robot is to achieve accurate and
   robust navigation in a given environment. To achieve such a goal, the
   ability of the robot to localize itself is crucial. In outdoor, namely
   agricultural environments, this task becomes a real challenge because
   odometry is not always usable and global navigation satellite systems
   (GNSS) signals are blocked or significantly degraded. To answer this
   challenge, this work presents a solution for outdoor localization based
   on an omnidirectional visual odometry technique fused with a gyroscope
   and a low cost planar light detection and ranging (LIDAR), that is
   optimized to run in a low cost graphical processing unit (GPU). This
   solution, named FAST-FUSION, proposes to the scientific community three
   core contributions. The first contribution is an extension to the
   state-of-the-art monocular visual odometry (Libviso2) to work with
   omnidirectional cameras and single axis gyro to increase the system
   accuracy. The second contribution, it is an algorithm that considers low
   cost LIDAR data to estimate the motion scale and solve the limitations
   of monocular visual odometer systems. Finally, we propose an
   heterogeneous computing optimization that considers a Raspberry Pi GPU
   to improve the visual odometry runtime performance in low cost
   platforms. To test and evaluate FAST-FUSION, we created three
   open-source datasets in an outdoor environment. Results shows that

Abstract = {{The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been deployed in almost every facet of
   our day to day activities. This is made possible because sensing and
   data collection devices have been given computing and communication
   capabilities. The devices implement System-on-Chips (SoCs) that
   incorporate a lot of functionalities, yet they are severely constrained
   in terms of memory capacitance, hardware area, and power consumption.
   With the increase in the functionalities of sensing devices, there is a
   need for low-cost synthesizable processors to handle control,
   interfacing, and error processing. The first step in selecting a
   synthesizable processor core for low-cost devices is to examine the
   hardware resource utilization to make sure that it fulfills the
   requirements of the device. This paper gives an analysis of the hardware
   resource usage of ten synthesizable processors that implement the
   Reduced Instruction Set Computer Five (RISC-V) Instruction Set
   Architecture (ISA). All the ten processors are synthesized using Vivado
   v2018.02. The maximum frequency, area, and power reports are extracted
   and a comparison is made to determine which processor is ideal for
   low-cost hardware devices.}},

Title = {{Open Source Waste Plastic Granulator}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In order to accelerate deployment of distributed recycling by providing
   low-cost feed stocks of granulated post-consumer waste plastic, this
   study analyzes an open source waste plastic granulator system. It is
   designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer
   waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for
   recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical
   specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power
   consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle
   size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less
   than \$2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is
   only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed
   recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size
   distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots
   and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to
   reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These
   results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an
   appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or
   small business-based distributed recycling.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Accurate laser scanning of plaster casts using validated,
   low-cost hardware represents a key issue in 3D orthodontics.
   Objectives. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of
   measurements taken from plaster casts (gold standard) with digital
   models of those casts created with a low-cost structural light DAVID
   laser scanner.
   Material and methods. Five different measurements were taken on each of
   14 plaster casts by 2 independent observers with an electronic caliper.
   The measurements were repeated 10 times on all 14 plaster casts by each
   observer, with a 1-week interval between each set of measurements. All
   14 plaster casts were digitized using a low-cost DAVID SLS 3 laser
   scanner. The same 5 measurements were performed on each of the 3D
   virtual surface models of the 14 plaster casts by 2 independent
   observers using Meshlab software in a manner similar to that used with
   the digital caliper. The measurements were repeated 10 times by the 2
   observers with 1 week between each set of measurements.
   Results. The laser-scanned models were more accurate than the plaster
   cast models in defining measurements based on simple tooth fissures. The
   accuracy of measurements based on complex tooth fissures were equivalent
   for the 2 types of model. For measurements based on interproximal dental
   contacts, the 2 methods of measurement were similar and both were
   notably poor in terms of accuracy.
   Conclusions. Three-dimensional virtual models obtained from the low-cost
   DAVID laser scanner can be used clinically, but only for certain types
   of measurements and indications.}},

Abstract = {{The overall prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the general
   population is similar to 14\% with more than 661,000 Americans having a
   kidney failure. Ultrasound (US)-guided renal biopsy is a critically
   important tool in the evaluation and management of renal pathologies.
   This Letter presents KBVTrainer, a virtual simulator that the authors
   developed to train clinicians to improve procedural skill competence in
   US-guided renal biopsy. The simulator was built using low-cost hardware
   components and open source software libraries. They conducted a face
   validation study with five experts who were either adult/pediatric
   nephrologists or interventional/diagnostic radiologists. The trainer was
   rated very highly (>4.4) for the usefulness of the real US images
   (highest at 4.8), potential usefulness of the trainer in training for
   needle visualization, tracking, steadiness and hand-eye coordination,
   and overall promise of the trainer to be useful for training US-guided
   needle biopsies. The lowest score of 2.4 was received for the look and
   feel of the US probe and needle compared to clinical practice. The force
   feedback received a moderate score of 3.0. The clinical experts provided
   abundant verbal and written subjective feedback and were highly
   enthusiastic about using the trainer as a valuable tool for future
   trainees.}},

Abstract = {{As conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning
   microscopy generally produce images with blurring at the upper and lower
   planes along the z-axis due to non-focal plane image information, the
   observation of biological images requires ``deconvolution.{''}
   Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread
   function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of
   microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate
   blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of
   open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution
   microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware.
   The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to
   construct a microscope system using commercially available optical
   components and open-source software. Although this system does not
   utilize expensive equipment, such as confocal and total internal
   reflection fluorescence microscopes, decent images can be obtained even
   without previous experience in electronics and optics.}},

Abstract = {{Industry is building larger, more complex, manycore processors on the
   back of strong institutional knowledge, but academic projects face
   difficulties in replicating that scale. To alleviate these difficulties
   and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open
   architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software
   exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and
   configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and
   supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open
   source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes
   from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open
   source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and
   framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design
   space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can
   change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run
   full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to
   very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating
   system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base
   reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the
   necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice
   for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated
   with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a
   validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment
   to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the
   whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both
   internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being
   adopted in education, industry, and government settings.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Due to the influence of current sampling and current reconstruction
   deviation, non-linearity of the inverters and parameter variation of the
   motors, DC offset component and high-order harmonic components exist in
   flux model, which makes the estimation of traditional rotor flux
   observer inaccurate and even divergent. In this paper, a rotor flux
   observer of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) with adaptive
   flux compensation is proposed. The DC offset component and the
   high-order harmonic components with the flux integrator observer can be
   eliminated by fed them back to the input of the flux integrator through
   PI regulator, so that the output of the flux integrator observer only
   contains the fundamental component, thus the rotor flux can be
   accurately estimated. Since the parameters of PI regulator are related
   with the estimated motor angular velocity, the control system has good
   robustness in a wide speed range. The flux observer is based on the
   voltage model in stationary coordinate system, so it is suitable for
   both surface and interior PMSMs. Moreover, the control method of the
   whole system has less computational complexity and fewer variables, it
   is easy to implement on a low-cost hardware platform. Finally, the
   experimental results verify that the flux observer has superior
   performance.}},

   systems applied to Smart Grids/Micro-Grids}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Large scale deployment of Smart Grids (SGs) and Smart Micro-Grids (SMGs)
   requires overcoming problems related to interoperability and high costs.
   To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial
   equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In
   particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent
   automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with
   Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of
   acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends
   to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the
   Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This
   low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing
   attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of
   integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial
   equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates
   PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the
   connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open
   source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an
   application case has been carried out within the automation system of an
   experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and
   monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are
   reported.}},

Title = {{A modular path planning solution for Wire plus Arc Additive
   Manufacturing}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) has proven its capability to
   build medium to large metallic parts thanks to its high-rate deposition
   and its potentially unlimited build volume. Moreover, the low-cost
   equipment and the ability to deposit various metals make WAAM a strong
   candidate to become a standard industrial process. However, like all
   Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, the key to manufacturing
   suitable parts lies in the generation of an optimised path that
   guarantees a uniform defect-free deposition. Most AM technologies have
   been able to use traditional path strategies derived from CNC machining,
   but the specificities inherent to the arc deposition make the use of
   those solutions unreliable across a variety of topologies. Nevertheless,
   studies have shown that superior results can be achieved by using a
   feature-based design approach, but developing a path strategy for each
   new geometry would be a very time-consuming task. Therefore, this paper
   introduces the Modular Path Planning (MPP) solution that aims to
   incorporate the modularity of feature based design into the traditional
   layer-by-layer strategy. By dividing each layer into individual
   deposition sections, this method allows users to adapt the path planning
   to the targeted geometry allowing the construction of a wide variety of
   complex geometries. This paper also proposes a software implementation
   that limits user interventions and reduces user inputs to basic CAD
   modelling operations. Moreover, the MPP has been compared to a
   traditional path planning solution and used to build a complex part for
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors propose a method to implement a low-cost
   hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system for power converters and microgrids
   design, test and analysis. This approach uses a digital signal processor
   (DSP) Texas Instruments as the HIL core. All the differential equations
   of the power converters are solved in real-time by the DSP and displayed
   in the digital-to-analogue outputs. Three different converters are
   modelled in this study: boost converter, single-phase inverter connected
   to the grid and three-phase inverter connected to the grid. Experimental
   results are obtained and compared to the HIL response. These results
   were made triggering the real converter and the HIL with the same
   open-loop pulse width modulation signal, showing high fidelity between
   the digital models over the real systems. In a second moment, a
   microgrid is modelled in the proposed HIL and tested with a closed-loop
   controller. The experiments show that the proposed hardware supports
   time steps as low as 1 mu s or 1 MHz update rate, depending on the
   model. The proposed technique has the potential to reduce testing time
   and cost, once commercial HIL devices such as Typhoon, dSPACE and RTDS
   have a significant cost, not affordable or available to all the research
   community}},

Abstract = {{The ability to access, design and create low cost sensors capable of

   Low-cost spectroscopy is one such application and mobile phone
   camera-based instruments have been used in pollution monitoring, medical
   applications in developing countries and vegetation analysis. Can such
   an instrument be developed and tested to assist with automated detection
   of materials, possibly from space? We tested two spectrometer designs
   inside a two unit (2U) cubesat frame against a series of materials
   exhibiting phenomenology in the visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) portion
   of the spectrum and vegetation groups. This was conducted in order to
   determine whether open source designs were capable of discriminating
   against similar materials, such as types of vegetation or types of
   iron-rich minerals. A spectral pipeline was created using open source
   programming software that was capable of converting raw sensor data into
   spectra, comparing samples of interest against a spectral library and
   returning an identification result with a confidence interval. We found
   that low-cost hardware sensitive to NIR and freely available software
   were able to identify types of materials in the study set, enabling
   applications in citizen science, education and outreach or even low-cost

   This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way
   valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by
   user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among
   decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated
   into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define
   specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be
   introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization
   process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through
   infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact
   kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular
   content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to
   increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an
   open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a
   novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files
   made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for
   assembly. Impact Statement Repeatable methods for decellularization are
   essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches,
   laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue
   infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts
   and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested.
   Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in
   an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a
   platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the low-cost of
   high performance optoelectronic and robotics components has supported a
   resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. We describe a
   low cost (below \$700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput
   imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system
   comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame
   with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running
   open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by
   simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer
   and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large
   imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and
   control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput
   microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial
   motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices
   termed `lab-on-a-comb' to screen the effects of different culture media
   components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot
   design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current
   design has an imaging area of similar to 420 x 300mm, which allows 29
   `lab-on-a-comb' devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual
   1 mu l samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence
   detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more
   sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{The capillary spread of personal devices equipped with wireless
   communication capabilities has enabled a series of high level services
   which build on capturing and processing the data packets emitted by such
   devices. In this paper we tackle the problem of exploiting such a
   methodology to perform occupancy estimation, i.e., understanding how
   many people are present in a specific place, an information which is
   valuable in many scenarios (HVAC and lighting system control, building
   energy optimisation, allocation and reservation of spaces, etc.).
   Traditional systems for occupancy estimation rely either on
   environmental sensors (CO2, temperature, humidity) or video cameras,
   which both have drawbacks: the former have generally low accuracy, while
   the latter require high setup and maintenance costs. In this paper we
   depart from such traditional approaches and propose a cheap and accurate
   occupancy estimation system based on the capture of both Wi-Fi and
   Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy management frames transmitted from
   users' devices. The system, implemented on low-cost hardware, leverages
   a supervised learning model to adapt to different spaces and transmits
   estimated occupancy information to a web-based dashboard. Experimental
   results in both indoor and outdoor uncontrolled scenarios demonstrate
   the validity of the proposed solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   is utilized to gather information and perform client-side calculations.
   The server works based on an open-source program written in Java

   to make the meter based on the ``Do It Yourself{''} methodology which
   requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping
   easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of
   measured information and convenience for the conclusive client. The
   information is measured in just about 1 ms which is superb for
   custom-designed IED. Furthermore, the measured qualities are calculated

   an Evaluation of Focusing Quality for Medical Ultrasound Imaging}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Generally, ultrasound receive beamformers calculate the focusing time
   delays of fixed sound speeds in human tissue (e.g., 1540 m/s). However,
   phase distortions occur due to variations of sound speeds in soft
   tissues, resulting in degradation of image quality. Thus, an optimal
   estimation of sound speed is required in order to improve image quality.
   Implementation of real-time sound speed estimation is challenging due to
   high computational and hardware complexities. In this paper, an optimal
   sound speed estimation method with a low-cost hardware resource is
   presented. In the proposed method, the optimal mean sound speed is
   determined by measuring the amplitude variance of pre-beamformed
   radio-frequency (RF) data. The proposed method was evaluated with
   phantom and in vivo experiments, and implemented on Virtex-4 with Xilinx
   ISE 12.4 using VHDL. Experiment results indicate that the proposed
   method could estimate the mean optimal sound speed and enhance spatial
   resolution with a negligible increase in the hardware resource usage.}},

Title = {{A Novel Nonlinearity Correction Algorithm for FMCW Radar Systems for
   Optimal Range Accuracy and Improved Multitarget Detection Capability}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars are an important class
   of radar systems, and they are quite popular because of their simpler
   architecture and lower cost. A fundamental problem in FMCW radars is the
   nonlinearity of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which results
   in a range of measurement errors, problems in multitarget detection, and
   degradation in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this paper, we
   first introduce a novel upsampling theory, then propose new algorithms
   to improve range accuracy and multitarget detection capability. These
   improvements are demonstrated both by simulations and actual lab
   experiments on a 2.4 GHz radar system. There are several techniques
   reported in the literature for VCO nonlinearity correction, but what
   makes the proposed approach different is that we focus on real-time
   processing on low-cost hardware and optimize the design subject to this
   constraint. We first developed an optimal upsampling theory which is
   based on almost-causal finite impulse response (FIR) filters. Compared
   to the sinc-based noncausal interpolation-based upsamplers, the proposed
   approach is based on using interpolation filters with few number of
   coefficients. Furthermore, interpolators are trained for a specific
   class of signals rather than a highly general signal set. Therefore, the
   proposed approach can be implemented on lower-cost hardware and perform
   quite well compared to more expensive systems.}},

   analyses of host and pathogen genomes as they are able to sequence
   millions of templates at a time. However, these large datasets can only
   be efficiently explored using bioinformatics analyses requiring huge
   data storage and computational resources adapted for high-performance
   processing. High-performance computing allows for efficient handling of
   large data and tasks that may require multi-threading and prolonged
   computational times, which is not feasible with ordinary computers.
   However, high-performance computing resources are costly and therefore
   not always readily available in low-income settings. We describe the
   establishment of an affordable high-performance computing bioinformatics
   cluster consisting of 3 nodes, constructed using ordinary desktop
   computers and open-source software including Linux Fedora, SLURM
   Workload Manager, and the Conda package manager. For the analysis of
   large antibody sequence datasets and for complex viral phylodynamic
   analyses, the cluster out-performed desktop computers. This has
   demonstrated that it is possible to construct high-performance computing
   capacity capable of analyzing large NGS data from relatively low-cost
   hardware and entirely free (open-source) software, even in
   resource-limited settings. Such a cluster design has broad utility
   beyond bioinformatics to other studies that require high-performance
   computing.}},

Title = {{A double PUF-based RFID identity authentication protocol in
   service-centric internet of things environments}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{503}},
Pages = {{129-147}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The rapid development of sensing, automation and communication
   technologies has led to the proliferation of the Internet of Things
   (IoT), providing recognized promising opportunities to build complex
   industrial systems and applications, leveraging the growing ubiquity of
   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and wireless sensor devices. With
   the pervasiveness of the interconnected systems encompassed with an
   ever-growing number of RFID-enabled devices being deployed, RFID
   security is an issue of high concern. As lightweight security encryption
   primitive, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is used to protect the
   information security of low-cost devices. Unfortunately, they are
   vulnerable to attacks, so countermeasures should be employed in the
   design. Aimed at low-cost and security of connected IoT devices to
   satisfy various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, a
   two-stage multiple-choice arbiter (TSMCA)-based PUF in RFID systems is
   proposed, referred as TSMCA PUF. It is aimed at the design of a double
   PUF-based bidirectional RFID identity authentication protocol that
   permits the realization of bidirectional authentication between a server
   and a tag for the IC authentication in low-cost RFID systems, where the
   exclusive-OR (XOR) and character padding operations are adopted to
   generate the response of the PUF; the string-matching method is used in
   authentication, without exposing the PUF response to the verifier.
   Evaluation and analysis show that the advantages over conventional
   schemes include reduced area, higher randomness, and high stability, yet
   experimental results depict that the proposed protocol is promising
   resilient against attacks and practical for the deployment of low-cost
   hardware. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Astrocytic Calcium Oscillations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Neurophysiological observations are clarifying how astrocytes can
   actively participate in information processing and how they can encode
   information through frequency and amplitude modulation of intracellular
   Ca2+ signals. Consequently, hardware realization of astrocytes is
   important for developing the next generation of bio-inspired computing
   systems. In this paper, astrocytic calcium oscillations and neuronal
   firing dynamics are presented by De Pitta and IF (Integrated \& Fire)
   models, respectively. Considering highly nonlinear equations of the
   astrocyte model, linear approximation and single constant multiplication
   (SCM) techniques are employed for efficient hardware execution while
   maintaining the dynamic of the original models. This low-cost hardware
   architecture for the astrocyte model is able to show the essential
   features of different types of Ca2+ modulation such as amplitude
   modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or both modes (AFM). To show
   good agreement between the results of original models simulated in
   MATLAB and the proposed digital circuits executed on FPGA, quantitative,
   and qualitative analyses including phase plane are done. This new
   neuromorphic circuit of astrocyte is able to successfully demonstrate
   AM/FM/AFM calcium signaling in its real operation on FPGA and has
   applications in self-repairing systems. It also can be employed as a
   subsystem for linking biological cells to artificial neuronal networks
   using astrocytic calcium oscillations in future research.}},

   Provided in Learning Scenarios}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional
   state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in
   the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the
   learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP
   (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform)
   infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user
   and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the
   emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We
   have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which
   addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the
   second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution
   and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and
   slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the
   capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a
   new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition
   Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and
   supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and
   delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new
   actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield.
   The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better
   recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more
   accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a
   rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary.
   This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems
   that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as
   the recognition of emotional states.}},

Abstract = {{Although cable-based seismic sensing systems have provided reliable data
   in the past several decades, they become a bottleneck for large-area
   monitoring and critical environmental (volcanic eruptions) sensing
   because of their cost, difficulty in deploying and expanding, and lack
   of accurate three-dimensional geographic information. In this paper, a
   new wireless sensing system is designed consisting of a portable
   satellite device, a self-sustaining power source, a low-cost
   computational core, and a high-precision sensor. The emphasis of this
   paper is to implement in low-cost hardware without requirements of
   highly specialized and expensive data acquisition instruments.
   Meanwhile, a computational-core-embedded algorithm based on compressive
   sensing (CS) is also developed to compress data size for transmission
   and encrypt the measured data preventing information loss. Seismic data
   captured by the accelerometer sensor are coded into compressive data
   packages and then transferred via satellite communication to a
   cloud-based server for storage. Acceleration and GPS information is
   decrypted by the `1-norm minimization optimization algorithm for further
   processing. In this research, the feasibility of the proposed sensing
   system for the acquisition of seismic testing is investigated in an
   outdoor field surface wave testing. Results indicate the proposed
   low-cost wireless sensing system has the capability of collecting ground
   motions, transferring data, and sharing GPS information via satellite
   communication for large area monitoring. In addition, it has a great
   potential of recovering measurements even with significant data package
   loss.}},

Abstract = {{Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including
   those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and
   off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive
   collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is
   not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs
   from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise
   patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that
   handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically
   designed for ECG data.
   In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named
   HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy
   settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We
   benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the
   developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.

Abstract = {{In order to provide dynamic adaptation of the performance/energy
   tradeoff, systems today rely on heterogeneous multicore architectures
   (different micro-architectures on a chip). These systems are limited to
   single-ISA approaches to enable transparent migration between the
   different cores. To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically
   scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT)
   for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy
   consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept
   as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an
   open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three
   different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical
   steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the
   accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software
   equivalent. The impact on the total execution time of applications and
   the quality of generated binaries are also measured.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid increase in the elderly population and single-person

   develop technology to collect daily life activities of the elderly. In
   this study, we tried to track the elderly living alone using images
   obtained from an open source camera. The system captures images by
   linking a low-cost camera module to open source hardware, and an
   algorithm is implemented to detect falls. This system can be used to
   reduce the cost of social care by improving the cost of care in the
   aging population, and this will contribute to promoting and developing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Most blood cells exhibit a natural deformation capability. Specifically,
   red blood cells (RBCs) are characterized by their great ability to
   deform and squeeze through microcapillary vessels, even with strict
   restrictions, recovering their shape after crossing them. That
   capability can be affected by various blood diseases (malaria, diabetes,
   etc), turning the cells into more rigid, and, as a result, it can
   generate blood flow disorders in the microcirculatory system. In this
   work, we propose a new micro-device to study the cell deformability
   consisting of a simple borosilicate micronozzle whose production is
   straightforward, fast, and uses low-cost equipment, when compared with
   other similar microfluidic devices found in the literature. We checked
   that the optical distortion coming from the glass is negligible when the
   micronozzle was submerged in a bath of glycerol, being able to perform
   blood flow visualizations through the micronozzle by using a high-speed
   video microscopy system. The shape of the converging area of our
   micronozzles produced an extensional flow. This type of flow is proper
   to conduct cell deformability assessments. After the characterization of
   our micro-device, we applied it to obtain the deformation index (DI) of
   both healthy and chemically treated human RBCs for several sections of
   our micronozzles. As expected, the experimental results show that the DI
   of healthy RBCs is much higher than the corresponding for more rigid
   (chemically treated) ones. These measurements show that the borosilicate
   nozzles allow to detect changes in the cellular mechanical properties
   similar to those produced by blood diseases, and suggest that, this
   microfluidic device could be easily transformed into a clinical tool for
   detection of blood diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Quality assurance detectors comprising cameras and a scintillator volume
   are of interest for use in spot scanning proton therapy due to its
   dynamic delivery. In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams
   with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using
   an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to
   synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D
   detector composed of 3 scientific complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator
   (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the
   synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals
   were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored
   using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by
   comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for
   triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6,
   140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The
   performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing
   the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different
   location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for
   different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and
   non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between
   triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10\% +/- 0.4\% for low SNR
   (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2\%. The
   background signal intensity varied by only 0.6\% from the shortest
   exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible
   triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera
   and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which
   will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan
   verification measurements in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates an open-source hardware and software platform for
   monitoring the performance of buildings, called Elemental, that is
   designed to provide data on indoor environmental quality, energy usage,
   HVAC operation, and other factors to its users. It combines: (i) custom
   printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK)
   radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes,
   and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as
   either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom
   dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the
   director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing
   Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage
   using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is
   built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the
   built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows
   occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental
   quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich
   querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and
   analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building
   controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational
   efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three
   distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1)
   deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated
   analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring
   solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of
   individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these
   applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually
   unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data
   with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a
   building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection,
   allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster
   maintenance during the lifetime of the building.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review on
   `open design' in academic fields including and beyond design and HCI.
   The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and
   open-source design (including `open hardware'): how researchers
   contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its
   practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself `making,' manufacturing
   and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were
   empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only
   as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate
   processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open
   and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design
   framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business
   and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the
   manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate
   innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster
   democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies
   do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the
   research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote
   sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues
   around open design community governance and ownership, safety and
   reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Open Design is an emerging area of research that seeks to connect and
   extend the culture of making, social innovation, open-source software,
   and open-source hardware. A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden
   participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and
   contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important
   access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior
   to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces' social media
   presence serve as the `front door' for Open Design activities. In this
   paper, we examine different `front doors' of Open Design, asking: What
   are the characteristics that produce makerspaces' social media
   presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to
   Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed
   500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in
   Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were
   able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces' social media
   presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants.
   Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces'
   social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design
   activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of
   these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways,
   and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online.
   In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media
   representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and
   differences between makerspaces' social media presences in the same
   geographical region have the strength of producing different identities
   across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential
   participation in Open Design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces IOM (an acronym for Interface Oculos Mouse, in
   Portuguese), an adaptive human-computer interface for people with motor
   disabilities in the upper limbs. The device, designed to be a low-cost
   hardware solution, consists of an eye frame glasses with integrated
   sensors responsible for detecting head movements and eyes blinks. IOM is
   accompanied by a user-friendly software interface that allows its users
   to adjust configuration options according to their needs and
   preferences. The goal of the interface is to enable the users to control
   the computer entirely. The paper presents the main components of both
   hardware architecture and software design that make up the developed
   prototype. At the end, the paper also reports the first evaluation
   process of the IOM device. Initial experiments performed using the
   AttrakDiff tool evaluate IOM, specifically from the end user's
   perspective, emphasizing desirable characteristics related to both
   hedonic and attractiveness dimensions. A comparison between some same
   purpose devices and the IOM using the Fitt's Law is presented in the
   paper. The preliminary experimental results show that the proposed
   platform attends to the usability aspect to computer requisites, in
   special for people with disabilities.}},

Title = {{An Open-Source, Automated Home-Cage Sipper Device for Monitoring Liquid
   Ingestive Behavior in Rodents}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Measuring ingestive behavior of liquids in rodents is commonly used in
   studies of reward, metabolism, and circadian biology. Common approaches
   for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered
   lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be
   measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time
   sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the
   following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered
   and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it
   quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for
   preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling
   high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others
   can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the
   performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated
   our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake
   and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used
   the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk,
   demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we
   integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility
   for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This
   device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery
   powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home
   cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than \$100, and all design
   files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase
   scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Electro-spark deposition (ESD) has been already recognized as an
   economically effective surface coating method. It requires a simple and
   low-cost equipment to run a process. Furthermore, mechanical and
   tribological properties of the coatings deposited using ESD are very
   promising, being, in many cases, improved compared to those of a
   substrate. When coatings are secondary treated via laser beam, they get
   a smoother surface and an amorphous structure. This paper reviews the
   investigations conducted on different substrates using different
   deposition materials via ESD as well as those of mechanical and
   tribological properties obtained. In particular, the review specifies:
   the role of ESD in enhancing the metal surface mechanical and
   tribological characteristics. It seems reasonable to apply ESD wider in
   order to improve mechanical and tribological properties of metal
   surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Data collection by conservation biologists is undergoing radical change,
   with researchers collaborating across disciplines to create bespoke,
   low-cost monitoring equipment from open-source hardware (OSH). Compared
   to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs.
   Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user
   inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly
   manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3)
   lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user
   support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a
   framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route
   to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of seismic noise provides a reliable estimation of the soil
   properties, which supposes the starting point for the assessment of the
   seismic hazard. The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique
   calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single
   three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several
   vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides
   an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these
   methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the
   cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means
   that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this
   work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed
   and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for
   working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition
   system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical
   geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware,
   open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to
   provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by
   any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and
   compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to
   register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The use of animal-borne devices in wildlife studies is increasing due to
   the miniaturization of sensors and reductions in component costs.
   Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several
   reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations;
   however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively
   expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present `OpenDropOff', an
   open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching
   animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by
   using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance
   wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors
   from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be
   constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD \$15
   in total; approximately 10\% or less of many commercially available
   drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and
   species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field
   deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby
   (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami)
   (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with
   the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during
   the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range
   of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching
   animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more
   efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides
   an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use
   of animal-borne devices.}},

Abstract = {{We report an easily assembled, high performance liquid/liquid separator
   constructed from a drilled-out block of aluminium, a short length of
   porous polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and a small number of
   off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts. The separator relies on
   the two incoming liquids having different wettabilities to the wall of
   the porous capillary, with the more strongly wetting liquid leeching
   through the porous wall while the other liquid passes unhindered through
   the interior channel. To achieve complete separation of the two phases,
   the fluid streams at the separator outlets are monitored optically, and
   the back-pressure at one outlet is iteratively adjusted using a
   motorised needle valve until smooth time-invariant signals are recorded
   at both outlets. The separator may be applied to many pairings of
   immiscible liquids over a broad range of flow rates, automatically
   establishing complete separation within minutes of activation and
   adjusting dynamically to subsequent changes in the flow conditions. The
   separator - whose performance is competitive with far costlier
   commercial systems - is released here as open hardware, with technical
   diagrams, a full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for
   its firmware.}},

Abstract = {{In all studies involving wind speed, such as meteorology, wind turbines
   and agriculture accurate speed information for decision making is
   required. There are several types of anemometers, with medium and high
   costs, such as cup, hot wire and pitot tubes, the hot wire being more
   sensitive and expensive than others. The device developed in this work
   is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of
   this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US\$ 50.00,
   using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The
   Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a
   sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use
   of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented
   calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer.
   The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the
   standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is
   R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments. As
   the reference anemometer (IPMet) has high embedded technology and the
   prototype is low cost, we conclude that the project has an attractive
   cost benefit for possible development and production, reaching the
   objective of this work.}},

Title = {{High-speed device synchronization in optical microscopy with an
   open-source hardware control platform}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Azimuthal beam scanning eliminates the uneven excitation field arising
   from laser interference in through-objective total internal reflection
   fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The same principle can be applied to
   scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control
   of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the
   builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate
   synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system
   and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and
   minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from
   open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller
   boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable,
   easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision
   analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced
   microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation,
   multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single
   central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast
   circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and
   multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency
   of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction
   artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software
   control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware,
   API, and software, is available online for community-based development
   and collaboration.}},

Title = {{HackRF plus GNU Radio: A software-defined radio to teach communication
   theory}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to
   signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that
   require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical
   goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in
   the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to
   provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of
   an open hardware-software platform able to capture and process a wide
   range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio
   will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed
   with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied
   with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based
   environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also
   support the suitability of the proposed platform.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of bird and bat species are incapable of carrying tags that
   transmit their position to satellites. Given fundamental power
   requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and
   battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of
   very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made
   to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization
   time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry
   system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve
   the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a
   UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware
   and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing
   estimation based on principal component analysis, localization
   techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon
   applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved
   vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly
   higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum
   range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed
   median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with
   localization errors of between 5\% and 14\% of the distance to the tag.
   In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT
   system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53\% less error.
   This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the
   UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance
   metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software
   installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be
   further developed in future works. For both the detection and
   localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically
   reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to
   collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The
   use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the
   simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are a rapidly evolving tool in
   geosciences and are increasingly deployed for studying the dynamic
   processes of the earth's surface. To assess the potential of autonomous
   low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we
   conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in
   2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV
   project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested
   for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface
   models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the
   well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground
   control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of
   the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a
   vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap,
   compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m
   obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different
   orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness
   changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the
   brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation
   season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation
   change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured
   melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about
   1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs
   in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable
   alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary
   software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential
   for other regions and geoscientific disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing (SC) is a promising technology that can be used for
   low-cost hardware designs. However, SC suffers from its long latency.
   Although parallel processing can efficiently shorten the latency,
   duplicated stochastic number generators (SNGs) are necessary, which
   cause substantial hardware overhead. This paper proposes a scalable SNG
   based on the spin-Hall-effect (SHE), which is capable of generating
   multiple independent stochastic streams simultaneously. The design takes
   advantages of the efficient charge-to-spin conversion from the Spin-Hall
   material and the intrinsic stochasticity of nanomagnets. Compared to
   previous spintronic SNGs, the SHE-SNG can reduce the area by 1.6x-7.8x
   and the power by 4.9x-13x while increasing the degree of parallelism
   from1 to 16. Compared to CMOS-based SNGs, the proposed SNG obtained
   24x-120x and 53x reduction in terms of area and power, respectively.
   Finally, three benchmarks were implemented, and the results indicate
   that SC implementations with the proposed SHE-SNG can achieve 1.2x-29x
   reduction of hardware resources compared to implementationswith previous
   CMOS-and spintronic-based designs while scaling the degree of
   parallelism from 1 to 64.}},

Abstract = {{Open-source technology for supporting the Industry 4.0 has become the
   target of academic research in many sectors. This study reviewed the
   trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial
   applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software
   for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental
   monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine
   safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using
   open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring
   device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for
   developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote
   communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an
   underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess
   the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes,
   respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the
   low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the
   experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source
   technology deployment when considering cost factors.}},

   paper scaffolds, planktonic bacteria migrate through liquid-filled
   pores, while the paper's cellulose fibres serve as anchor points for
   sessile colonies (biofilms). Using this novel approach, we explore
   bacterial colonisation dynamics in different landscape topographies and
   characterise the community composition of Escherichia coli strains
   undergoing centimetre-scale range expansions in habitats structured at
   the micrometre scale. The bacteria-in-paper platform enables

Abstract = {{Usage of low-cost hardware in large antenna arrays and low-power
   wireless devices in Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the degradation
   of practical beamforming gains due to the underlying hardware
   impairments, such as in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI). To
   address this timely concern, we present a new nontrivial closed-form
   expression for the globally optimal least squares estimator (LSE) for
   the IQI-influenced channel between a multiantenna transmitter and
   single-antenna IoT device. Thereafter, to maximize the realistic
   transmit beamforming gains, a novel precoder design is derived that
   accounts for the underlying IQI for maximizing received power in both
   single and multiuser settings. Finally, the simulation results,
   demonstrating a significant -8 dB improvement in the mean squared error
   of the proposed LSE over existing benchmarks, show that the optimal
   precoder designing is more critical than accurately estimating
   IQI-impaired channels. Also, the proposed jointly optimal LSE and
   beamformer outperforms the existing designs by providing 24\%
   enhancement in mean signal power received under IQI.}},

Title = {{Is the Use of a Low-Cost sEMG Sensor Valid to Measure Muscle Fatigue?}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Injuries caused by the overstraining of muscles could be prevented by
   means of a system which detects muscle fatigue. Most of the equipment
   used to detect this is usually expensive. The question then arises
   whether it is possible to use a low-cost surface electromyography (sEMG)
   system that is able to reliably detect muscle fatigue. With this main
   goal, the contribution of this work is the design of a low-cost sEMG
   system that allows assessing when fatigue appears in a muscle. To that
   aim, low-cost sEMG sensors, an Arduino board and a PC were used and
   afterwards their validity was checked by means of an experiment with 28
   volunteers. This experiment collected information from volunteers, such
   as their level of physical activity, and invited them to perform an
   isometric contraction while an sEMG signal of their quadriceps was
   recorded by the low-cost equipment. After a wavelet filtering of the
   signal, root mean square (RMS), mean absolute value (MAV) and mean
   frequency (MNF) were chosen as representative features to evaluate
   fatigue. Results show how the behaviour of these parameters across time
   is shown in the literature coincides with past studies (RMS and MAV
   increase while MNF decreases when fatigue appears). Thus, this work
   proves the feasibility of a low-cost system to reliably detect muscle
   fatigue. This system could be implemented in several fields, such as
   sport, ergonomics, rehabilitation or human-computer interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of technological advances and innovations in transportation
   technologies, application of driving simulators for the investigation
   and assessment of the driving process provides a safe and suitable
   testing environment. Although driving simulators are crucial for further
   improvements in transportation, it is important to resolve one of their
   main disadvantages-simulator sickness. Therefore, suitable methods for
   the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this
   paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator
   sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical
   activity-electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for
   electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy
   volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for
   artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on
   the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric
   activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate
   recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in
   describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are
   growing simultaneously. These applications need new intelligent devices
   along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement
   indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are
   possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design,
   implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse
   oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) with
   low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development
   of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and
   estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the
   established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a
   remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further
   processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the
   registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model
   was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with
   low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via `HTTP requests' for
   data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device.
   Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the
   availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The
   system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was
   to achieve energy consumption 20\% lower than that of devices in the
   market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on
   the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001\% which proves its
   applicability in healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that the utilization of unused millimeter-wave
   (mmWave) spectrum is inevitable due to unavailability of required
   bandwidth in the conventional RF band to support the high data demands
   of 5G. Large antenna arrays with beamforming capabilities are required
   to compensate for the high path loss at mmWave frequencies. We are at
   the verge of a massive mmWave radio front-end deployment, and
   low-complexity low-cost hardware beamforming solutions are required now
   at this stage than ever before. In this paper, one such solution is
   demonstrated and analyzed. A high-performance and low-complexity
   lens-based beamformer consisting of constant dielectric material
   (epsilon(r)) with antenna feeds is presented for multi-beam operation. A
   prototype is developed based on the classical synthesis approach, and in
   line with the requirements of mmWave hybrid multiuser multiple-input
   multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. A characterization at 28 GHz is
   performed wherein an uplink signal-to-noise ratio of user terminals is
   evaluated with the zero-forcing (ZF) baseband signal processing.
   Radiation performance of a single-source beamformer is measured in an
   anechoic environment, and end-to-end ergodic sum spectral efficiency
   performance is estimated based on the measured data. It is shown that
   the constant-epsilon(r) -based beamformer solution is simple, yet
   significantly outperforms conventional antenna array beamformers with
   analog phase shifter networks, making it a promising candidate for
   future hybrid massive MIMO systems.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a set of theoretical and practical tools for the
   stabilization of dc networks. In order to do so, we propose a new
   framework to study the dynamics of de grids-one that permits the
   combination of power converter models with those impedances-directly in
   higher-order terms. This mathematical setting includes a convenient
   modeling specification that allows one to analyze complex high-gain
   converter topologies and to develop an energy-based stability analysis
   for dc grids with potential destabilizers such as loads with negative
   impedance characteristics (e.g., constant power loads). We show that
   instability problems arise due to a power imbalance between passive and
   non-passive loads, hence power balancing is a suitable stabilizing
   mechanism. Moreover, a low-cost hardware solution that ensures stability
   is provided in the form of a lossless (H-bridge) stabilizing filter. The
   new theoretical results, combined with the proposed implementation,
   offer a low-cost alternative with respect to other
   (battery/super-capacitor) energy-storage-based existing strategies.
   Experimental results based on a high voltage gain quadratic converter
   feeding multiple non-passive loads are included.}},

   GPIAS) is a versatile tool to, e.g., estimate hearing thresholds or
   identify subjective tinnitus percepts in rodents. A proper application
   of these paradigms depends on a reliable measurement of the ASR
   amplitudes and an exact stimulus presentation in terms of frequency and
   intensity. Here, we introduce a novel open-source solution for the
   construction of a low-cost ASR setup. The complete software for data
   acquisition and stimulus presentation is written in Python 3.6 and is
   provided as an Anaconda package. Furthermore, we provide a construction
   plan for the sensor system based on low-cost hardware components.
   Exemplary GPIAS data from two animal models (Mus musculus, Meriones
   unguiculatus) show that the ratio histograms (1-GPIAS) of the
   gap-pre-stimulus and no pre-stimulus ASR amplitudes can be well
   described by a log-normal distribution being in good accordance to
   previous studies with already established setups. Furthermore, it can be
   shown that the PPI as a function of pre-stimulus intensity (threshold
   paradigm) can be approximated with a hard-sigmoid function enabling a
   reproducible sensory threshold estimation. Thus, we show that the
   open-source solution could help to further establish the ASR method in
   many laboratories and, thus, facilitate and standardize research in
   animal models of tinnitus and/or hearing loss.}},

Abstract = {{Organic dye detection requires high sensitivity, low-cost equipment,
   simplified procedures, and real-time capabilities; thus, electrochemical
   methods are gradually emerging in this field instead of chromatography.
   However, much attention has been paid to toxic and complex metal or
   noble-metal hybrid materials for constructing electrochemical sensors,
   which is extremely limiting for practical applications. In this study, a
   metal-free electrocatalyst, MWNTs with carboxylic groups (MWNTs-COOH),
   was prepared through surface oxidation in a piranha solution and a
   simple hydrothermal treatment. The obtained MWNTsCOOH possessed superior
   hydrophilicity, increased conductivity and substantial active carbon or
   carboxylic group sites, as determined by characterization using Raman
   spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, electrochemical surface area
   analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The above advantages
   enabled MWNTs-COOH to exhibit excellent electrochemical activities, with
   a satisfactory utilization for determining trace Rhodamine B (RhB),
   showing a lower calculated detection limitation of 2.66 nM and a wider
   linear range from 0.05 to 850 mM with outstanding specificity and
   reproducibility. Furthermore, it was found that the carboxyl group on
   the MWNTs would probably have triggered the electron redistribution and
   exposed more adjacent active carbon sites, which facilitate the
   electrocatalytic function to C] N on the RhB directly.}},

Abstract = {{Human visual attention performs the spatio-temporal regularity, an
   inherent regularity in dynamic vision, for the natural visual tasks.
   However, recent computational visual attention models still have
   deficiency to reflect the spatio-temporal regularity thoroughly.
   Motivated by this, we propose a bio-inspired motion sensitive model to
   estimate human gaze positions in driving. The proposed model has four
   key advantages. First, inspired by two types of motion sensitive
   neurons, this model can perceive the motion cues from different
   directions spatially and temporally. Second, compared to conventional
   deep learning based models, this model does not rely on expensive
   training samples with gaze annotations. Third, the proposed model is
   based upon the visual signal processing without constructing a complex
   deep neural network architecture, which enables this model to be
   implemented with low-cost hardware. Fourth, inspired by the visual
   pathway in drosophila motion vision, the visual signal processing on
   directional and depth motion sensitive map largely enhances this model's
   competence in a similar way of human gaze positions in driving. To test
   this proposed model, we collect a driving scene dataset from the
   perspective of egocentric vision that aims to systematically evaluate
   the performance of spatio-temporal visual attentional models. The video
   clips in the dataset are categorized into ten popular driving
   conditions. The proposed model is evaluated by comparing with the human
   baseline of the gaze positions. Experimental results demonstrate that
   the proposed model can effectively estimate the human gaze positions in
   driving and consistently outperforms traditional visual attention models
   as well as the deep learning based model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We present the developmental considerations, design, and deployment of
   an autonomous modular terrestrial rover for ice-sheet exploration that
   is inexpensive, easy to construct, and allows for instrumentation
   customization. The total construction cost for this rover is less than
   USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it
   can be built using facilities frequently available at academic
   institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and
   software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the
   rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS
   receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation
   models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed
   this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local
   variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover
   conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland
   Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface
   elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins.
   During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on
   a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow
   instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs
   that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a
   site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation,
   demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging
   applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple
   modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable.
   Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial
   expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed
   deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables
   direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for
   conventional field expeditions.}},

Abstract = {{In today's world of computation, data compression takes vigorous part in
   most of the real-time and embedded system applications. Some of such end
   uses are essentially derived for specific task, however their
   realization are not described and delineated. To bridge this variance,
   an attempt is made to experimentally present an evidence behind usage of
   vector quantization levels of 50 in popular digital cameras, generating
   other vector quantization levels. This has been incorporated to reduce
   the trade-off between quality and size of reconstructed images by the
   use of vector quantization levels less than quantization level of 50.
   The prime objective of the work encompasses the generation of vector
   quantization levels from 10 to 75 for digital cameras in Discrete Cosine
   Transform (DCT) based image compression and analyzing the performance of
   proposed algorithm efficiency through parameters such as Mean Square
   Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Compression Ratio (CR),
   Bits per Pixel (bpp) and percentage Space Saving by applying it to
   standard test images. In this exploration, vector quantization level of
   four digital cameras namely Canon PowerShot A700 (Superfine), Fuji
   FinePix A700 (Fine), Nikon CoolPix P5000 (Fine) and Sony Digital Single
   Lens Reflex (DSLR) A700 (Fine) have been used. The experiment is also
   featured with the modeling and deploying of algorithm onto BeagleBone
   Black, Raspberry Pi low cost hardware devices along with presenting the
   comparative performance evaluation amongst cameras considered. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Visible Light Communication (VLC) paradigm allows the reusing of
   existing illuminating infrastructures in order to provide data
   communication. VLC can be considered a promising technology also for
   positioning in indoor environments, due to its potentially high accuracy
   and low costs. However, the main obstacle to the use of VLC for
   localization purposes is the high level of environmental noises, mainly
   due to sunlight. A novel approach, for easily measuring environmental
   noises and compensating their effects on localization results performed
   by an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) based on VLC, is proposed in this
   work. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is adopted to divide the
   total bandwidth into a series of non-overlapping frequency sub-bands
   corresponding to each signal, while an estimation of Signal to Noise
   Ratio (SNR), obtained through real time Power Spectral Density
   measurements in the proper frequency ranges, is exploited to compensate
   the error in positioning due to sunlight and other wide-band external
   optical disturbing signals. The proposed approach has been validated
   through experimental tests, carried out using a simple deployment of low
   power lamps, low cost hardware and a software defined approach. In the
   region under test, receiver position has been experimentally detected
   with higher accuracy in comparison to classical FDM approach, confirming
   the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed technique. In order to
   further validate the proposed approach, an additive measurement campaign
   has been successfully carried out considering a scenario characterized
   by very low SNR levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of wireless networks has made the long-term need for
   communications security more imperative. In various wireless
   applications, images and/or video constitute critical data for
   transmission. For their copyright protection and authentication,
   watermarking can be used. In many cases, the cost of wireless nodes must
   be kept low, which means that their processing and/or power capabilities
   are very limited. In such cases, low-cost hardware implementations of
   digital image/video watermarking techniques are necessary. However, to
   end up with such implementations, proper selection of watermarking
   techniques is not enough. For this reason, in this paper, we introduce
   computation optimizations of the implemented algorithm to keep the
   integer part of arithmetic operations at optimal size, and, hence,
   arithmetic units as small as possible. In addition, further analysis is
   performed to reduce quantization error. Three different
   hardware-architecture variants, two for image watermarking and one for
   video (pipelined), are proposed, which reutilize the already small
   arithmetic units in different computation steps, to further reduce
   implementation cost. The proposed designs compare favorably to already
   existing implementations in terms of area, power, and performance.
   Moreover, the watermarked images'/frames' errors, compared to their
   floating point counterparts, are very small, while robustness to various
   attacks is high.}},

Title = {{A human-computer interface based on the ``voluntary{''} pupil
   accommodative response}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{53-63}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Changes in pupil size are governed by the autonomic nervous
   system but may be systematically driven by voluntary shifting the gaze
   in depth. Thus, the pupil accommodative response (PAR) that accompanies
   voluntary gaze shifts from a far to a near target might be exploited as
   a simple human-computer interface (HCI), bypassing the somato-motor
   system. Here we aim to characterize PAR in quasi-natural conditions with
   low-cost equipment and test the possibility to use PAR as a binary
   communication tool.
   Methods: Nineteen healthy subjects were instructed to voluntary switch
   the focus from a far to a near target upon presentation of an auditory
   cue. Three protocols addressed the effects of monocular/binocular
   vision, eye illuminance, duration of near vision, target texture and
   target brightness on PAR features. In a fourth protocol PAR was used to
   establish binary communication at different bit rates.
   Results: PAR amplitude decreased with increasing eye illuminance and was
   modulated by monocular/binocular vision, duration of near vision or
   target texture. PAR amplitude was larger with a bright near target and a
   dark far target than vice-versa. However, PAR was always clearly
   present, regardless of the experimental manipulations. PAR-based
   communication performance achieved an accuracy of 100\% at 10 bits/min
   and 96\% at 15 bits/ min.
   Significance: Voluntary PAR is a robust signal, and can achieve a high
   communication speed when used as an HCI. This study provides a proof of
   concept for a PAR-based HCI, potentially useful to communicate with
   locked in patients with preserved visual and autonomic functions.}},

Abstract = {{An automated method based on open-source hardware was created for the
   separation of porphyrins fractions from crude oil, an essential step for
   the quantification of V and Ni as metalloporphyrins. Preparative liquid
   chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH
   to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by
   using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller,
   programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first
   derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils
   (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505
   and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile
   was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS.
   The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene
   fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins
   in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds,
   with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1,
   corresponding to 18\% of total V), in comparison to the one from the
   biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7\% of total V). The
   overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information
   on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds.}},

Title = {{An accurate localization system for Nondestructive testing based on

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{467-474}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Localization of eddy current probes in Nondestructive Testing allows
   merging the defect detection with the information about defect
   positions. Typically, this task requires the usage of additional and
   costly position measurement systems or software assisted handlers in
   controlled laboratory conditions. However, many of these tests require
   free hand movements of the eddy current probes. In addition, in many
   industrial applications low cost is a stringent requirement. This paper
   proposes a novel solution to address the considered issues. In
   particular, the paper describes the usage of a magnetic 2D wireless
   localization method, able to track the probe position during the
   execution of Nondestructive Tests. To the best of our knowledge, such
   approach is novel and promises to provide localization information in
   Nondestructive Testing by means of low-cost hardware. Moreover, it is
   characterized by a light computational burden, since it reuses most of
   the equipment already needed for the test itself. Preliminary results,
   proving the suitability of a real time simultaneous testing and
   localization system, are reported in this paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{In Earth science, we must often collect data from sensors installed in
   remote locations. Retrieving these data and storing them can be
   challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers,
   communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data
   structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are
   open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's
   Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks
   (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published
   Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new
   approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to
   achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an
   order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently
   modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users
   with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected
   remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from
   distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with
   several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options
   include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and
   Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018).
   Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ
   Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub
   engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free
   Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable
   Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors
   nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and
   evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries'
   open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer.}},

Abstract = {{A single-camera stereo-digital image correlation (stereo-DIC) system to
   obtain 3D full-field vibration measurements is proposed. The optical
   setup is composed of two planar mirrors and a single low frame rate
   camera, thus resulting in a compact and low-cost equipment. The two
   mirrors are used to create pseudo-stereo images of a target surface on
   the camera sensor, which are then correlated by using stereo-DIC. The
   image acquisition process is carried out at low frame rates and the
   Nyquist-Shannon frequency limitation is overcome by adopting a
   down-sampling approach under the hypothesis that the vibration signal is
   characterized by a single known frequency component. The developed
   pseudo-stereo DIC system allows to obtain 3D full-field vibration
   measurements in a frequency range up to 4 kHz even with an available
   frame rate (at full resolution) of 178 fps. The effectiveness of the
   described approach has been verified by performing vibration
   measurements on a cantilever plate and a turbine blade. (C) 2019

Title = {{Using Low-Cost Virtual Reality Simulation to Build Surgical Capacity for
   Cervical Cancer Treatment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE Worldwide, more than 80\% of people diagnosed with cancer will
   require surgery during their disease course, but only 5\% to 20\% of
   low- and middle-income countries have access to safe, affordable, and
   timely surgery. Developing surgical oncology skills requires significant
   time and mentoring. Virtual reality (VR) simulators can reduce the time
   required to master surgical procedures but are prohibitively expensive.
   We sought to determine whether a VR simulator using low-cost computer
   gaming equipment could train novice surgeons in Africa to perform a
   virtual radical abdominal (open) hysterectomy (RAH).
   METHODS Our RAH VR simulator used the Oculus Rift (Oculus VR, Menlo
   Park, CA), a VR headset with hand controllers that costs less than
   \$1,500. Surgical novices learned to perform five key steps of a virtual
   RAH. We measured and identified predictors of movement and time
   efficiency for the simulation.
   RESULTS Ten novice surgeons in Lusaka, Zambia, enrolled in the study.
   Movement and time efficiency greatly improved over time. Independent
   predictors of movement efficiency were number of simulations, surgical
   experience, and time since college graduation. Independent predictors of
   time efficiency were number of simulations, surgical experience, days
   between simulation sessions, age, sex, and an interaction between number
   of simulations and surgical experience.
   CONCLUSION Low-cost VR may be an effective tool to help surgical novices
   learn complex surgical oncology procedures. If learning to perform VR
   surgical procedures with low-cost hardware leads to faster mastery of
   surgical procedures in the operating room, low-cost VR may represent one
   of the solutions to increasing access to surgical cancer care globally.

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs) have shown promising
   potential in mobile 3-dimensional grasping applications, but they still
   suffer from some difficulties impeding their board applications, such as
   target detection and indoor positioning. For the autonomous grasping
   mission, the UAMs need ability to recognize the objects and grasp them.
   Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel
   oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method
   can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method
   can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a
   rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was
   designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control,
   and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are
   fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated in
   multiple experimental trials, highlighting its applicability of
   autonomous aerial rotational grasping in Global Positioning System (GPS)
   denied environments. We believe this system can be deployed to many
   potential workplaces which need UAM to accomplish difficult manipulation
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy incorporation in many countries takes different forms.
   In many developed countries, grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV)
   installations are widely coupled with lucrative Feed-in-Tariffs (FiT).
   However, conventional grid-tied solutions are not readily viable in many
   developing countries mainly due to intermittent grids with load shedding
   and, in some cases, lack of net-metering or FiT. Load shedding refers to
   an intentional electrical power shutdown by the utility company where
   electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over
   different parts of the distribution region. This results in a
   non-continuous availability of the utility grid for many consumers over
   the course of a day. In this work, the key challenges in the integration
   of solar energy explicitly in residential power back-up units are
   reviewed and system hardware level requirements to allow optimized solar
   PV utilization in such intermittent grid environments are analyzed.
   Further, based upon the low-cost sensing and real-time monitoring
   scheme, an online optimization framework enabling efficient solar
   incorporation in existing systems to achieve minimum grid dependence in
   intermittent grid environments is also provided. This work is
   particularly targeted for over 1.5 billion residents of semi-electrified
   regions in South Asia and Africa with the weak and intermittent grid.}},

Abstract = {{A metalens consisting of nanometer rectangular holes etched on silver
   film is proposed, and the focusing effect is actualized in the visible
   region. The rectangular holes are arranged on concentric circles, and
   the fields excited by these holes constructively interfere due to having
   the same propagation phase. The propagation phase is obtained by
   optimizing the sizes of the rectangular holes and the radii of the
   circles. This metalens can focus linearly or circularly polarized light,
   and numerical simulations and experimental measurement confirm its
   focusing performance. The proposed metalens has the advantages of
   flexible design, loose constraint to incident polarization, low-cost
   equipment, and simpler experimental operation, and we believe it will be
   useful to applications in optical integration and visible light imaging.

Abstract = {{European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots is an outdoor robotics
   contest focusing on multidomain emergency response scenarios. In this
   context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater,
   and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations
   inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany
   Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage
   to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be
   used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the
   challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from
   scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other
   participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks (similar to
   83\% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a
   complete description of the work carried out and the system used during
   the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in
   particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology,
   providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones,
   allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way.
   Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden
   of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a
   concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve
   complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic
   competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines
   useful for reacting to unexpected events. Finally, the team was honored
   with the Creativity Award ``for building a land robot from scratch in
   less than 2 days when their ground platform broke.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Monocular visual SLAM has become a popular research area in recent years
   because of its advantages of requiring low-cost hardware and providing
   high computational efficiency. This paper presents a multiple maps based
   SLAM system with four threaded architecture. When multiple maps are
   introduced the system works consistently in a large area for significant
   length of time . A new map is created automatically when tracking fails
   or the size of the map becomes too large. Tracking using multiple small
   maps reduces the accumulation of errors in visual SLAM to a significant
   extent when compared with a single map. To enhance the robustness of
   tracking an algorithm for predicting the camera pose is introduced .
   Exhaustive evaluations performed on publicly available indoor and

Title = {{A novel low-noise movement tracking system with real-time analog output
   for closed-loop experiments}},

Abstract = {{Background: Modern electrophysiological experiments are moving towards
   closing the loop, where the extrinsic (behavioral) and intrinsic
   (neuronal) variables automatically affect stimulation parameters. Rodent
   experiments targeting spatial behavior require animal 2D kinematics to
   be continuously monitored in a reliable and accurate manner. Cameras
   provide a robust, flexible, and simple way to track kinematics on the
   fly. Indeed, several available camera-based systems yield high
   spatiotemporal resolution. However, the acquired kinematic data cannot
   be accessed with sufficient temporal resolution for precise real-time
   feedback.
   New method: Here, we describe a novel software and hardware system for
   movement tracking based on color-markers with real-time low-noise output
   that works in both light and dark conditions. The analog outputs
   precisely represent 2D movement features including position,
   orientation, and their temporal derivatives, velocity and angular
   velocity.
   Results: Using adaptive windowing, contour extraction, and rigid-body
   Kalman filtering, a 640-by-360 pixel frame is processed in 28 ms with
   less than 4 ms jitter, for 100 frames per second. The system is robust
   to outliers, has low noise, and maintains a smooth, accurate output even
   when one or more markers are temporarily missing. Using freely-moving
   mice, we demonstrate novel applications such as replacing conventional
   sensors in a behavioral arena and inducing novel place fields via
   closed-loop optogenetic stimulation.
   Comparison with existing method(s): To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first tracking system that yields analog output in real-time.
   Conclusions: This modular system for closed-loop experiment tracking can
   be implemented by downloading an open-source software and assembling
   low-cost hardware circuity.}},

   with Long Range Sub-GHz Backbone}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization is one of the most promising
   approaches for indoor localization due to its accurate positioning
   capabilities, immunity against multipath fading, and excellent
   resilience against narrowband interference. However, UWB researchers are
   currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware
   that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware
   platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's
   DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both
   long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes,
   flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy
   implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set
   Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source
   and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and
   analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware
   platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of
   the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The
   accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab
   environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was
   obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model
   was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most
   important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy
   consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node
   and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for
   several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast
   deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone
   network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy
   installation, and low power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{In order to meet the development requirement of portable and low cost
   equipment in the field of non-destructive detection of fresh meat
   quality parameters, a new method based on multi spectral diffuse
   reflectance technology for fresh meat quality detection is proposed.
   Based on the diffusion approximation theory and combined with the sample
   scattering coefficient, absorption coefficient and refractive index of
   beef and other parameters, based on Monte Carlo simulation of thin
   vertical beam on the radio, on a certain divergence angle of LED light
   source are initialized with correction respectively from the light
   source position probability distribution and different angles of the
   irradiation probability distribution, angle, direction angle the
   probability distribution and different incident light angle sample
   reflection caused by the energy loss and influence on the photon weight,
   the LED divergence angle under different source detector diffuse
   reflectance and depth of detection distance, the optimum distance
   between the light source and the detector is 15 mm, then according to
   the distance, to build a multi spectral diffuse reflection detection
   platform, multi spectral detection platform by 8 groups of 470, 535,
   575, 610, 650, 720, 780, 960 nm LED. The source composition corresponds
   to the quality parameters of fresh beef to be detected.
   At the same time, according to the 8 LED light source, the light source
   design layout structure of probe point symmetry, 8 light sources inside
   the probe to the detector as the center, symmetric distribution, while
   using LED light source divergence angle, determine the installation
   position of the light source to the sample surface and the vertical
   distance of each light source, to ensure the light source to the sample
   area is uniform. In addition, the probe embedded within the design of
   signal acquisition, amplification and transmission components, signal
   acquisition part uses the spectral response range of 400 similar to 1
   100 nm light intensity detector, sample diffuse intensity after
   processing to the host computer through the signal acquisition and
   amplification circuit, and the software finished modeling and analysis.
   Finally in order to verify the performance of the detection system, with
   fresh beef freshness in the color parameter (L{*}, a{*}, b{*} ) and the
   pH value as the index was tested using 60 samples, 8 light source under
   the original light intensity value and corrected reflectance values
   respectively, and then the beef samples according to 3:1 the proportion
   is divided into set and prediction set correction, for the original
   value of light intensity and reflectivity values, respectively, using
   multiple linear regression (MLR) , Multiple Linear Regression Partial
   Least Squares Regression partial least squares regression (PLSR) and
   partial least squares support vector machine regression Partial
   Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) three methods, model
   parameters in the original light intensity and reflectivity data of the
   two cases, and get the best results. The results show that the results
   of modeling using reflectivity data are better than those of light
   intensity data. The MLR modeling results of parameters L{*}, a{*} and
   b{*} are better than those of PLSR and LS-SVR, and their correlation
   coefficients of prediction set are 0. 983 2, 0. 907 2 and 0. 935 9,
   respectively, and the prediction set errors are 1. 00, 2. 14 and 0. 67,
   respectively. The LS-SVR modeling results of parameter pH value are
   better than that of PLSR and MLR, and the correlation coefficient of the
   prediction set is 0. 942 0 and the error is 0. 19. Finally, using 20
   pieces of beef samples which did not participate in the test to validate
   the model, the color of L{*}, a{*}, b{*} and pH parameters of the
   prediction value of the correlation coefficient and the measured value
   is greater than 0. 85, the results proved that using multispectral
   diffuse reflection technology and building the multispectral reflectance
   detecting system are feasible for the detection of fresh beef the
   quality parameters, this method can provide reference and basis for the
   nondestructive testing instrument design of portable or micro fresh beef

Abstract = {{One of the major concerns for fruit selling companies, at present, is to
   find an effective way for rapid classification and detection of fruit
   defects. Olive is one of the most important agricultural product, which
   receives great attention from fruit and vegetables selling companies,

   industry. The small size and multiple colours of the olive fruit
   increases the difficulty of detecting the external defects. This paper
   presents new efficient methods for detecting and classifying
   automatically the external defects of olive fruits. The proposed
   techniques can separate between the defected and the healthy olive
   fruits, and then detect and classify the actual defected area. The
   proposed techniques are based on texture analysis and the homogeneity
   texture measure. The results and the performance of proposed techniques
   were compared with varies techniques such as Canny, Otsu, local binary
   pattern algorithm, K-means, and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. The results
   reveal that proposed techniques have the highest accuracy rate among

Abstract = {{Considering its low-cost equipment, single-point incremental forming
   (SPIF) can be appropriate for rapid prototyping of sheet metal parts,
   since a simple hemispherical head tool is usually implemented without
   any dedicated dies. Incremental forming at elevated temperatures
   assisted by electric current, which is hereafter called resistance SPIF,
   is an innovative process for forming sheet metals with a
   high-strength-to-weight ratio and a low formability at room temperature.
   In the present research, the effect of utilizing various lubricants on
   both the formability and surface finish of the Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy
   sheet is investigated using the resistance SPIF of the truncated cone at
   different feed rates, vertical pitches, and currents. To this end, the
   Taguchi design of experiment and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) are
   employed. A cooling water system is designed and applied to the forming
   tool to improve both its life and the duty cycle of the process. The
   results show that the formability of Ti-6Al-4V sheet can be enhanced
   using the resistance SPIF, which strongly depends on the lubrication
   condition. In order of significance, the lubricant and current have the
   most influence on the maximum achievable forming depth and the
   lubricant, the feed rate, and the vertical pitch have the highest
   effects on the surface roughness. Based on the ANOVA results, the
   graphite-based anti-seize compound and the graphite powder are suggested
   for an appropriate surface finish and the highest formability,
   respectively, in the resistance SPIF within the range of the considered
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a new approach for Sun tracking systems is presented. Due
   to the current system limitations regarding costs and operational
   problems, a new approach based on low cost, computer vision open
   hardware and deep learning has been developed. The preliminary tests
   carried out successfully in Plataforma solar de Almeria (PSA), reveal
   the great potential and show the new approach as a good alternative to
   traditional systems. The proposed approach can provide key variables for
   the Sun tracking system control like cloud movements prediction, block
   and shadow detection, atmospheric attenuation or measures of
   concentrated solar radiation, which can improve the control strategies
   of the system and therefore the system performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The estimation and prediction of state-ofhealth (SOH) and state-of-
   charge (SOC) of Lithium-ion batteries are two main functions of the
   battery management system (BMS). In order to reduce the computation cost
   and enable deployment of the BMS on the low-cost hardware, a
   Lebesgue-sampling-based extended Kalman filter (LS-EKF) is developed to
   estimate the SOH and SOC. An LS-EKF is able to eliminate unnecessary
   computations, especially when the states change slowly. In this paper,
   the SOH is first estimated and the remaining useful life is predicted by
   the LS-EKF. Then, the estimated SOH is used as the initial battery
   capacity for SOC estimation and prediction. The SOH and SOC estimation
   and prediction are calculated repeatedly in the whole battery service
   life. The proposed method is verified with the application to the
   capacity degradation of the Lithium-ion battery. The results show that
   the LSEKF-based algorithm has a good performance in SOH and SOC
   estimation and prediction in terms of accuracy and computation cost.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber photometry is the process of recording bulk neural activity by
   measuring fluorescence changes in activity sensitive indicators such as
   GCaMP through an optical fiber. We present a system of open source
   hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting
   of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the
   Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user
   interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The
   system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two
   external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed
   illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by
   different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal.
   Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to
   noise for a given average excitation light intensity than
   sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially
   cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we
   anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be
   easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of

Title = {{Open-Source Hardware Platforms for Smart Converters with Cloud
   Connectivity}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and hardware implementation of
   open-source hardware dedicated to smart converter systems development.
   Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped
   with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum
   power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for
   photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous
   changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising
   solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is
   deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware
   platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and
   released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to
   benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The
   usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to
   design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics,
   which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid
   growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform
   itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of
   different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system
   is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of
   different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different
   renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio
   frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of
   measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm
   types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully
   tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real
   photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art
   performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way
   to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight
   parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows
   different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources,
   converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation
   strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source
   hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and
   industrial purposes so far.}},

Abstract = {{Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing
   countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce.
   Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting
   hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor
   networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy
   working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the
   safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous
   surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a
   predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements
   in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development
   process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost
   ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction
   materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability
   and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was
   crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The
   ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous
   navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at
   a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption
   of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the
   wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for
   specific monitoring applications and working environments.}},

Title = {{Open Sourcing as a Profit-Maximizing Strategy for Downstream Firms}},
Journal = {{STRATEGY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-57}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper characterizes and explores a corporate strategy in which
   downstream firms collaborate to develop open substitute designs for
   proprietary hardware they would otherwise purchase from upstream
   suppliers. This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms
   distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy
   that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but
   which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of
   downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible
   to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological
   trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and
   other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to
   develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better
   communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects
   collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms.
   Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input
   they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design
   as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to
   free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for
   several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free
   revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software
   or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This
   ``scale-stealing{''} mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream
   suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only,
   free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs
   of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating
   increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs
   benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free
   riders.}},

Abstract = {{It seems that computing systems that imitate the brain can be achieved
   by integrating of electronics and neuroscience. In recent years,
   neuromorphic systems have been developed by the fusion of electronics
   and neuroscience. Since neurons are the basis of neural systems,
   constructing the optimized digital neuron plays a critical role in
   neuromorphic applications. Furthermore, the dynamic of ionic channels,
   which are the causative agents of synaptic plasticity is the main
   characteristic of biological neurons. The Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model is
   a mathematical description of biological neuron that is widely used in
   neuroscience to explore the relation of action potential propagation and
   information transmission. This model consists of nonlinear differential
   equations, which approximates the electrical characteristics of
   excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac muscle. In this paper, a
   simplified version of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model was proposed by
   substituting its complex nonlinear dynamics with linear ones. Next, a
   digital circuit for the proposed linear model was designed, which can be
   implemented on a low-cost hardware platform, such as field-programmable
   gate array (FPGA). Comparison of MATLAB simulation of original model and
   Vivado simulation of the proposed digital circuit confirm that obtained
   results are in good agreement. The proposed digital circuit compared
   with the earlier circuits is more successful in terms of replicate
   essential characteristics of spiking responses and ionic currents in the
   biologically plausible model of neural activities. This new digital
   design will be applicable in developing neuro-inspired chips and
   exploring the brain's functionality in information processing.}},

Title = {{Lightweight and optimized sound source localization and tracking methods
   for open and closed microphone array configurations}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{63-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Human-robot interaction in natural settings requires filtering out the
   different sources of sounds from the environment. Such ability usually
   involves the use of microphone arrays to localize, track and separate
   sound sources online. Multi-microphone signal processing techniques can
   improve robustness to noise but the processing cost increases with the
   number of microphones used, limiting response time and widespread use on
   different types of mobile robots. Since sound source localization
   methods are the most expensive in terms of computing resources as they
   involve scanning a large 3D space, minimizing the amount of computations
   required would facilitate their implementation and use on robots. The
   robot's shape also brings constraints on the microphone array geometry
   and configurations. In addition, sound source localization methods
   usually return noisy features that need to be smoothed and filtered by
   tracking the sound sources. This paper presents a novel sound source
   localization method, called SRP-PHAT-HSDA, that scans space with coarse
   and fine resolution grids to reduce the number of memory lookups. A
   microphone directivity model is used to reduce the number of directions
   to scan and ignore non significant pairs of microphones. A configuration
   method is also introduced to automatically set parameters that are
   normally empirically tuned according to the shape of the microphone
   array. For sound source tracking, this paper presents a modified 3D
   Kalman (M3K) method capable of simultaneously tracking in 3D the
   directions of sound sources. Using a 16-microphone array and low cost
   hardware, results show that SRP-PHAT-HSDA and M3K perform at least as
   well as other sound source localization and tracking methods while using
   up to 4 and 30 times less computing resources respectively. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{This article presents an innovative and low-cost solution for optimizing
   the acquisition of performance data of small-laboratory-scale

   setup is combined with an optional web-platform, which enables fast
   analysis and comparison of the collected data.
   For the demonstration of the instrument in operation, comparison of
   measurements of solar cell with the developed setup and commercial
   products has been conducted. It is shown that the presented prototype
   provides values of accuracy and precision during I-V curve recording,
   comparable with the values measured using a commercial source-meter
   (Keithley 2400). The study also discusses the unique advantages of easy
   transport and data collection by the setup and the drawbacks in the
   hardware, which have been observed during a round robin study.}},

Title = {{Molecular drug susceptibility testing and strain typing of tuberculosis
   by DNA hybridization}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the detection of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) is of high importance both for diagnostics, since
   drug resistance is primarily caused by the acquisition of SNPs in
   multiple drug targets, and for epidemiological studies in which strain
   typing is performed by SNP identification. To provide the necessary
   coverage of clinically relevant resistance profiles and strain types,
   nucleic acid-based measurement techniques must be able to detect a large
   number of potential SNPs. Since the Mtb problem is pressing in many
   resource-poor countries, requiring low-cost point-of-care biosensors,
   this is a non-trivial technological challenge. This paper presents a
   proof-of-concept in which we chose simple DNA-DNA hybridization as a
   sensing principle since this can be transferred to existing low-cost
   hardware platforms, and we pushed the multiplex boundaries of it. With a
   custom designed probe set and a physicochemical-driven data analysis it
   was possible to simultaneously detect the presence of SNPs associated
   with first- and second-line drug resistance and Mtb strain typing. We
   have demonstrated its use for the identification of drug resistance and
   strain type from a panel of phylogenetically diverse clinical strains.
   Furthermore, reliable detection of the presence of a minority population
   (<5\%) of drug-resistant Mtb was possible.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring
   technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to
   short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage.
   To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be
   improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and
   deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power
   and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable,
   open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to
   search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect
   evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are
   designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic
   monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the
   conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of
   increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account
   for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple
   times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model
   for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For
   each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with
   partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against
   a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used
   for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection
   algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and
   facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform
   large-scale monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{An important challenge for our society is the transformation of
   traditional power systems to a decentralized model based on renewable
   energy sources. In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for
   real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality
   (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors
   should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line
   analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced
   low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and
   power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front
   end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition,
   conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked
   on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is
   capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to
   thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described
   as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and
   visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with
   full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to
   send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of
   the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a
   wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk
   metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances.
   The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to
   the community as a powerful tool for general usage.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a novel norm-1 regularized imaging technique, based on
   the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, is
   presented. This technique divides the sensing matrix of the imaging
   system in submatrices by columns. This method is capable of imaging
   metallic targets with a reduced amount of measurements, by sectioning
   the imaging domain into several regions and optimizing them individually
   in different nodes. This technique reduces the amount of information to
   be shared among the nodes, compared to the consensus ADMM that divides
   the sensing matrix into submatrices by rows. This makes the
   communication among the nodes faster for large imaging domains that need
   to be distributed into several computational nodes of a cluster. A
   compressive reflector antenna (CRA) has been recently proposed as a low
   cost hardware to provide high sensing capacity. The use of the
   columnwise division ADMM algorithm in combination with the imaging
   capabilities of the CRA allows a distributed and quasi-real-time
   imaging, while reducing the communications among the computational
   nodes.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a method for sensor fusion between odometers,
   gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer and visual landmark localization
   system. The method is designed for estimation of all 6 degrees of
   freedom (both translation and attitude) of a wheeled robot moving in
   uneven terrain. The fusion method is based on continuous estimation of
   the mean square error of each estimated value and allows different
   sampling rates of each sensor. Due to the simple implementation, it is
   suitable for real-time processing in the low-cost hardware. In order to
   evaluate the precision of the estimated position, stochastical models of
   sensors (with parameters matching real hardware sensors) were used and
   random trajectories were simulated. The virtual experiments showed that
   the method is resistant to the failure of any sensor except the
   odometers: however, each sensor provides improvement in the resultant
   precision. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a holistic framework for the design,
   implementation and experimental validation of Battery Management Systems
   (BMS) in rotatory-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that allows to
   accurately (i) estimate the State of Charge (SOC), and (ii) predict the
   End of Discharge (EOD) time of lithium-polymer batteries in small-size
   multirotors by using a model-based prognosis architecture that is
   efficient and feasible to implement in low-cost hardware. The proposed
   framework includes a simplified battery model that incorporates the
   electric load dependence, temperature dependence and SOC dependence by
   using the concept of Artificial Evolution to estimate some of its
   parameters, along with a novel Outer Feedback Correction Loop (OFCL)
   during the estimation stage which adjusts the variance of the process
   noise to diminish bias in Bayesian state estimation and helps to
   compensate problems associated with incorrect initial conditions in a
   non-observable dynamic system. Also, it provides an aerodynamic-based
   characterization of future power consumption profiles. A quadrotor has
   been used as validation platform. The results of this work will allow
   making decisions about the flight plan and having enough confidence in
   those decisions so that the mission objectives can be optimally

Abstract = {{Combining fluorescence and transmitted light sources for microscopy is
   an invaluable method in cellular neuroscience to probe the molecular and
   cellular mechanisms of cells. This approach enables the targeted
   recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial
   cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological
   recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to
   mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here,
   we present the development of several microcontroller devices that
   provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs)
   for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one
   microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of
   transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this
   illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two
   pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium
   (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of
   intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+
   imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable
   components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into
   existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day. The
   microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional
   illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility
   and speed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for
   basic and preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and
   functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are
   acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil.
   New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating
   image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal
   and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning
   the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must
   provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically
   interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal
   holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript,
   animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are
   described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia
   delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive
   coil.
   Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable
   of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in
   the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in
   echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with
   receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils,
   while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time
   series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison
   to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD)
   files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote
   dissemination.
   Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF
   coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we ensue on the development of a taxonomy aimed at
   categorizing distractions in the P300b domain. Explicitly, we
   investigate the effect that auditory distractions, distinctively that of
   ambient noise (AN), passive talking (PT), and active listening (AL) have
   on the signal of a visual P300 Speller in terms of accuracy, amplitude,
   latency, user preference, signal morphology, and overall signal quality.
   This work is part of a larger EEG based project and is based on the P300
   speller BCI (oddball) paradigm and the xDAWN algorithm, with eight
   healthy subjects; while using a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface
   based on low fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Our
   results show that the accuracy was best for the Lab (LC) at 100\%,
   followed by AN at 92.5\%, PT at 90\% and last AL at 87.5\%, which
   results were in identical order to the subjects' preferences. In
   addition, the amplitude and latency did not show any statistical
   significance in all settings This paper provides additional results that
   impart insight into the practicability of the aforementioned P300

Abstract = {{In this paper, an in-house developed robot, named as ExploDroid, is
   introduced with details of its construction, mapping, object-detection
   implementation and functional demonstration. It is developed using the
   Robot Operating System (ROS) platform. The proposed application of this
   robot is to obtain a labelled 2D map of an unknown static indoor
   environment using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
   algorithm, for creation of a map and also for object -detection in it.
   The objects would then be appropriately labelled. The end result is a 2D
   map of the environment, with labelled objects. The SLAM algorithm is
   implemented using the open -source Gmapping package, which is integrated
   into the ROS Framework. Besides, it is also used alongside the RViz
   Visualization tool for viewing the maps created. By employing low-cost
   hardware, the cost of building such a platform has been made quite
   economical while retaining the precision of the map obtained.
   Experimental trials in real world environments yielded accurate and
   verifiable object -detection and labelling results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present two simple methods for automatic color naming,
   the first one learns the pixel-wise color name annotations from the
   color-chips and later method learns the image-wise color names from the
   real-world weakly labelled images. Color information is an important
   feature for many computer vision applications. Color name as a
   descriptor finds it's applications in many real-world tasks such as
   Color Blind assistance, image retrieval and scene understanding. Color
   naming in images is a challenging problem due to shadows, view angles,
   illumination conditions and surface reflections. Manual labelling of
   color names for real-world images in applications like search engines,
   fashion parsing and tracking is a tedious task and time consuming. The
   proposed systems for color naming automates the process and avoids human
   labelling. These methods are based on superpixels in the CIELAB color
   space. We trained Random Forests classifier with color-chip dataset for
   pixel-wise color naming and for image-wise color naming it is trained on
   weakly color labelled image dataset. Both models are tested on
   real-world images for color name judgments. Experimental results shows
   that color names learned through these proposed systems have advantages
   in terms of implementation costs, speed of execution and can be used in
   real-time applications with low-cost hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor network (WSN) applications have expanded considerably
   over the past decade or so and now, solutions exit for various
   innovative applications. These wireless networks adopt commercial off
   the shelf devices and standardized protocols, which inherently creates
   security challenges. These challenges are ever changing as malicious
   interference and intrusion techniques evolve and dynamic efficient
   hardware becomes increasingly accessible. This paper presents the
   development of multiple low-cost hardware and software platforms
   designed so security enhancements and modifications to WSN protocol
   architecture and packet structure can be designed and tested. Each
   testbed has been built satisfying the requirements of being available as
   unmodified commercial off the shelf (COTS) components and based on open
   source software. The testbeds provide versatility through operating on
   various operating systems including Windows and Linux, are reproducible
   and can be deployed in a way which replicates real world WSNs. Each
   distinct system provides remote access, real time and off line data
   analysis, specific control of each network node and the ability to
   upload data from the WSN. This paper describes in-detail the individual
   pieces of suitable hardware for WSN protocol and packet structure design
   and illustrates the system architecture required to form testbeds which
   can experimentally validate modifications to a WSN protocol.
   Additionally, a baseline is defined and encapsulates the ZigBee
   standard. Example results of the distinct testbeds in operation are
   provided along with the specific open source software being used.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new multi-agent framework using open-source
   software (MAFOSS). The proposed framework is a modular and
   cost-effective open-source hardware and software platform that is
   intended to help develop multi-agent systems for research and education.
   Numerous multi-agent platforms have been developed in the literature to
   date that are used in various robotic applications, such as
   surveillance, target localization, cooperative estimation, among others.
   However, most of them are either tailored towards particular
   applications or driven by expensive software and hardware. The proposed
   MAFOSS system is developed for robotic applications, where a team of
   mobile agents (robots) is deployed to achieve a common goal. A major
   contribution of the MAFOSS system is the development of an open-hardware
   platform for differential-drive mobile robots (herein called
   ``eduMOD{''} mobile robots). The software architecture of the current
   framework mostly relies on the robot operating system (ROS). Regardless
   of internal hardware and/or software architecture, appropriate actions
   can be applied to actuators of an individual or a team of mobile agents
   for controlling their motions. A few case studies have been conducted to
   evaluate the performance of MAFOSS.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a vehicle ride simulation system for immersive virtual
   reality, consisting of a wheelchair for vibration and vestibular
   sensation, and a pedestal with a curved surface for the wheelchair to
   run on, utilizing a gravitational component. Vehicle motion feedback
   systems often use a six degrees of freedom motion platform to induce
   virtual vehicle acceleration on the user's body. However, because motion
   platforms are typically complex and expensive, their use is limited to
   relatively large-scale systems. The proposed system enables the
   presentation of variety of road property sensations as well as
   continuous acceleration of vehicle motion using high-bandwidth wheel
   torque produced by two direct-current motors. Our unique combination of
   a wheel and a pedestal can present vibration and vestibular sensations
   of vehicle acceleration with simple, light-weight, and low-cost
   equipment. In our demonstration experience, users can perceive the
   sensation of various road properties, such as uneven surfaces, and
   continuous acceleration of a car or roller coaster.}},

Abstract = {{The Abbe School of Photonics (ASP) provides photonics education of
   graduate and doctoral students at the Friedrich Schiller University in
   Jena, Germany. The main instrument for training students in optical
   sciences is a Master's degree program, which is open to international
   students, research-oriented and supported by German photonics industry.
   In this context, a conceptually new open lab Makerspace for photonics
   was established to support both the internal students in the realization
   of innovative and creative processes, as well as to build a strong and
   curious community of like-minded people from outside of the university.
   The photonics Makerspace provides all tools and materials needed to
   setup state-of-the-art optical instruments. Furthermore, it provides
   technical mentoring, open workshops and lectures. Partners from the
   photonics industry corroborate the process of making by well-established
   open innovation schemes and are integrated into the Makerspace with
   hackathon and innovation camp formats where the Makerspace users work on
   industry challenges. Finished and ongoing projects are transformed into
   freely accessible, open source hardware while a commercial exploitation
   of the projects is supported. Out of the broad topical spectrum of
   ongoing projects, two quite advanced examples are a low-cost
   smartphone-based 3D-scanner with a cloud-based, free software and a
   high-resolution microscope built of 3D-printed modules. For these
   projects, apart from hardware and software, also workshops and lectures
   are available. Other examples include a drone for medical applications
   in search and rescue, a smartphone-based lithography setup, a
   Raman-spectrometer, a camera array for meteorite detection, and many
   more. All activities of the Makerspace are scientifically investigated
   with special attention on the interaction between open innovation
   approaches and the Maker scene. Here, we will share our insights into
   potentials and opportunities offered by this novel educative approach.}},

   a plug an add-on board called a HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) onto the
   Raspberry Pi 3 board is used. As with more complex industrial systems,
   the HAT provides a standard approach for identifying the HAT and
   automatically configuring the GPIOs and drivers as needed. Variables
   such as temperature, humidity, light, etc are sensed, NodeRed is used to
   continuously monitor the variables, and send the, to a cloud based
   system based on a MQTT messaging system. This allows to define graphical

   defined and messages sent back to the Raspberry PI platform where
   control actions can be taken in order to correct any potential undesired

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new framework for the development of an ROV
   (Remote Operated Vehicle) as a final tangible objective, but also
   important is the creation of a team to get it.
   In recent years, the investment on the ROVs has increased significantly.
   Moreover, the number of underwater investigations has advanced
   constantly, in the fields of submarine environments, marine geology,
   chemical, naval engineering, among many others. The ROV was born because
   of the needed for a resource in these investigations. This equipment
   must be capable and efficient into this environment, the underwater one.
   At present, there is a large list of ROVs, provided with more efficiency
   and features, but the cost is relatively expensive. The primary
   objective of this project is to create a low-cost ROV for investigations
   with a low budget. For these reasons, the design of this ROV uses Open
   Hardware and Open Software. Furthermore, the structure and the
   electronic components of the ROV are designed with cheap materials which
   are also easy to be found, as far as possible.
   The addition of different specific projects, set the methodology to
   create a big project incorporated these specific projects, compose part
   of the vehicle submarine. Every part is revised by the teacher of this
   knowledge area involved in the project.
   At present, the project continues developing and growing. For the
   students, the possibility of forming part of this project is a great
   opportunity to apply the knowledge achieved along their studies to a
   common project, and create a multidisciplinary working team with a
   common goal to attain from different areas of knowledge. It has also
   provided the students with the opportunity of extending the project into
   their final degree project, Master thesis and PhD thesis, respectively.
   Finally, collaboration among different areas of knowledge is essential.
   As a result, the creation of a multidisciplinary group of teachers and
   students, have been collaborating towards obtaining an operative ROV.
   The areas involved in this project are: science and navigation
   techniques, shipbuilding, robotics, mechanics, electronics, Computer
   Science, hydrodynamics, automatics, ... Therefore, the project team has
   been composed of teachers and students from the Computer Science,
   Radioelectronic Engineering and Shipbuilding Engineering fields of the
   University of Cadiz.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion under insulator (CUI) is a damage of materials due to a
   reaction between a surface of steel and an insulation layer. The CUI can
   generate an impact greatly on the industry, because it can occur in
   equipment without warning. An inspection system was designed to detect
   the CUI from the outside of a steel plate using a non-destructive
   testing associated with the eddy current technique. This research is to
   develop a prototype device and software for CUI detection by using
   low-cost equipment. 600-1000 Hz sinusoidal signals induced by a sine
   wave function generator were applied to detect CUIs, and the results
   were demonstrated by the proposed CUI detection program. The
   experimental results reveal that the pick-up coil with laminated core
   probe can detect the CUIs effectively, and the designed sinusoidal eddy
   current system with the proposed CUI detection program can monitor and
   detect the CUIs with up to 3 mm insulation thickness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a feasible and low-cost solution for designing
   optical-inertial hybrid motion capture systems by integrating two
   subsystems: the inertial subsystem and the optical subsystem. We
   calibrate the relative pose of the optical sensor module and the human
   joint to establish the transformation between the joint parameters and
   the optical sensor data, so that the data fusion can be performed under
   the same reference frame. To construct the above motion capture system,
   an optical-inertial data fusion scheme is proposed, which leverages the
   optical data of key nodes of the human body to correct the inertial data
   with accumulated errors. The proposed system can support long-term
   drift-free operation with a low-cost hardware setup, avoiding the drift
   problem of the inertial motion capture system. Simulation experiments
   have shown that optical data can reduce the drift error to the
   centimeter level. The practical experiment shows that the virtual
   character can complete the loop detection after the inertial position is
   corrected by the optical data. Our motion capture system outputs
   standard motion capture data, which can be directly imported into
   engines such as Unity3D and Unreal.}},

Abstract = {{Motion control is one of the key technologies in automatic parking
   system. The vehicle real-time positioning information plays a
   fundamental role in motion control. The automatic parking scene is
   essentially an low-speed unmanned scene in a small area.This paper
   mainly studies the vehicle positioning technology in this scene, namely
   the Closed-loop update of parking spot. Considering the high price of
   equipment used in general vehicle positioning technology, this paper
   selects the vehicle positioning technology with simple and low cost
   equipment. Firstly, the positioning accuracy of traditional track
   reckoning is confirmed, and the simulation with carsim \& simulink is
   used to verify the track reckoning ability. Secondly, the method of
   track reckoning with speed is proposed to locate moving vehicle in real
   time. Finally, due to the inaccurate wheel speed of vehicle at low speed
   in real vehicle verification section,an improved method of track
   reckoning used multi-information is proposed. The method combines the
   advantages of traditional and wheel speed methods of track reckoning to
   complete the track reckoning better. The software simulations and real
   vehicle tests about parallel parking trajectory show that the track
   reckoning with multi-information fusion is superior in Closed-loop
   update of parking spot.}},

   problem-solving possibilities as in the complexity of the new systems.
   SoC-based computers such as those used in embedded systems have been
   under growing attention due to their low-cost, low-power, reduced
   footprint and high performance characteristics. These features allow
   small users as well as industries to design, develop and build wide
   range of applications with efficiency as the common aspect. A number of
   platforms that integrate this kind of technology were also proposed by
   different manufacturers, some employing the open hardware concept.
   Embedded applications spread over a wide range of fields, which make
   them hard to characterize in a general sense. For this reason, benchmark
   suites are often used as a tool for system's performance evaluation.
   However, such suites consist on a large number of different algorithms,
   which can spend time and energy to run on SoC computers. In order to
   contribute to the performance assessment of such systems, this paper
   presents a simple method for comparing different platforms, based on
   execution time of simple but representative algorithms: sorting,
   cross-correlation and discrete-cosine transform calculation for vectors.
   The power consumption was also considered. Six distinct architectures
   were used as a case study. Several computer experiments were conducted
   in order to make possible a statistic characterization of different load
   conditions in distinct platforms, so their comparison can be done in a
   meaningful way. Results show that the proposed method provides a good
   estimation of relative system performance, which can be useful as a
   criterion choice for selecting different embedded platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Instruments are a very important tool for the good comprehension of any
   science. In the engineering electrical field, most of the practice
   laboratories are equipped with a large set of devices. One of the major
   challenges to get a complete laboratory is the economic cost.
   Professional electronic devices as multi-meters, oscilloscopes or
   spectrum analyzers are quite expensive on the market. Fortunately, with
   the aid of software-defined radio (SDR), low-cost equipment can be
   built. A fundamental device in these projects is the RTL-SDR dongle.
   This electronic accessory captures wireless signals and puts them on a
   USB port. Therefore, with digital signal processing it is possible to
   get access to low-cost instruments like spectrum analyzers. In this
   work, an integration of hardware and software is presented. An
   application is developed with Python and implemented on a Raspberry Pi3
   B+. This proposal captures, demodulates, and displays AM and FM signals.
   The signals obtained can be observed on frequency or time or can be
   recorded as well.}},

Abstract = {{A predictable network performance is mission critical for many
   applications and yet hard to provide due to difficulties in modeling the
   behavior of the increasingly complex network equipment. This paper
   studies the problem of providing deterministic latency guarantees in
   small networks based on low-capacity hardware (e.g., in-cabin and
   industrial networks): such networks are of increasing importance, need
   to meet stringent performance requirements, but have hardly been
   explored so far. Our main contribution is the design, implementation,
   and evaluation of Loko, a system which provides predictable latency
   guarantees in programmable networks using low-cost hardware. Loko relies
   on a novel measurement-based methodology and uses deterministic network
   calculus to derive a reliable performance model of a given switch. To
   this end, we also show that state-of-the-art models in the literature
   like QJump and Silo fall short to model the behavior of such switches,
   due to incorrect architectural and performance assumptions. As a case
   study, we implement Loko for the Zodiac FX switch. Our experiments are
   encouraging: we find that the derived models are indeed accurate,
   allowing Loko to provide deterministic end-to-end guarantees with
   low-cost programmable devices.}},

Abstract = {{Testbeds are a key tool for evaluating and benchmarking IoT solutions.
   Several public testbeds are being run by institutions around the world.
   These are built with a variety of tools, and are typically ``heavy{''}
   installations with dedicated wiring, hard installations, switches,
   servers, and a reservation and experiment management back-end. To
   complement those, we have taken the opposite, minimalistic, approach in
   designing the OpenTestBed. The OpenTestBed features all the tools
   necessary to build a testbed from off-the-shelf components such as
   Raspberry Pi single-board computers, OpenMote B low-power wireless
   devices, and glass domes. Each TestBox in the testbed connects to an
   MQTT broker over WiFi, no dedicated wiring or back-end is needed. The
   Inria-Paris OpenTestBed testbed of 80 motes has cost only 9,480 euros,
   and is open-access. The OpenTestBed is a fully open-source and
   open-hardware project, which several institutions have already adopted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel camera-based approach for parking slot
   detection with markings, using surround-view cameras mounted on
   vehicles. By introducing a pipeline of marking-specific image feature
   extraction and novel filtering stages, we detect parking slot markings
   in pinhole cameras as well as in cameras with fisheye lenses without
   using a computationally intensive bird-view transformation. After
   projecting a compact set of image features into 3D space, our
   orientation-specific Hough transform finds explicitly the left and right
   edges of the parking slot markings in desired orientations, which is the
   basis for marking detection and tracking. We present a novel technique
   to detect and track the parking slots in the scene in a coherent manner,
   that preserves the structure of the overall parking layout and its
   temporal consistency. Our algorithm is designed to run on low cost
   hardware used in vehicles and it is shown to run at 30fps on ARM CPUs.
   We validated our algorithm on videos representing real-world scenarios
   of parking slots including marking occlusion, degradation and different
   weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The most significant determinant of quality of life is sleep quality,
   with better sleep resulting in a healthier and longer life.
   Polysomnography, or PSG, is a standardized system to get the medical
   records from multi-lead ECG recordings. However, PSG is a complicated,
   expensive and time-consuming procedure. Other alternatives include home
   sleep centre (HSC) development as a tool for early diagnosis and
   prevention of sleep disorders while keeping high accuracy. HSC uses
   low-cost equipment by utilizing single-lead ECG and accompanying
   applications. ECG is one of the media used in diagnosing and analysis of
   medical information related to sleep disorders. This study aims to
   develop a computerized sleep diagnosis application to help experts
   classify symptoms by investigation and evaluation of QRS morphological,
   time-frequency characteristics, and nonlinear analysis from single-lead
   ECG recordings. The classification of non-overlapping of ECG-apnea based
   non-linear analysis using an ensemble approach. The ensemble learning
   model approach, using the Boosted Tree test, yielded an accuracy of
   94.7\%, prediction speed of 120 obs/s and training time of 2.374 s. The
   QRS morphological characteristic and improved non-overlapping ECG

Abstract = {{Localization systems based on Visible Light Communication (VLC) are
   considered as good candidates for indoor environments, due to their high
   accuracy, low costs and the possibility of reusing existing
   infrastructures for both lighting and positioning. However, high level
   of environmental noises, mainly due to sunlight, significantly affect
   the performance of VLC positioning systems. A novel approach, for easily
   measuring environmental noises and compensating their effects, has been
   proposed in this work. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is adopted
   to divide the total bandwidth into a series of non-overlapping frequency
   sub-bands corresponding to each signal, while an estimation of Signal to
   Noise Ratio, obtained through real time Power Spectral Density measure,
   is exploited to compensate error positioning due to sunlight and other
   wide-band external optical nice sources. Proposed approach has been
   validated through experimental tests, carried out using a simple
   deployment of low power lamps, extremely low cost hardware and a
   Software Defined approach. In the region under test, receiver positions
   have been experimentally detected according to an improved accuracy in
   comparison with classical FDM approach, confirming the correctness of
   proposed technique, according to low Signal to Noise Ratio levels.}},

Abstract = {{Visible Light Communication (VLC) exploits optical frequencies, diffused
   by usual LED lamps, for adding data communication features to
   illuminating systems. This paradigm has attracted a growing interest in
   both scientific and industrial community in the latter decade.
   Nevertheless, classical wireless communication mechanisms for physical
   and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers are hardly available for VLC, due
   to the massive external interference caused by sunlight. A correct
   signal carrier recover in high noise conditions represent a significant
   challenge. In this work, it is shown that the synchronization frame
   length affects the performance of the system in terms of Bit Error Ratio
   (BER). Since different external conditions require different minimum
   preamble lengths, we considered an Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   approach, based on multi-arm bandit formulation, for obtaining a low
   impact in both BER and goodput of the communication. A low-cost hardware
   VLC system, implementing a learning algorithm on a Frequency Shift
   Keying Modulation (FSK), has been designed and tested in different
   environmental conditions. Experimental results show that a proper choice
   of preamble length overcomes, in terms of BER and goodput, the classical
   approach based on fixed preambles.}},

Abstract = {{Wrist-worn devices hold great potential as a platform for mobile health
   (mHealth) applications because they comprise a familiar, convenient form
   factor and can embed sensors in proximity to the human body. Despite
   this potential, however, they are severely limited in battery life,
   storage, bandwidth, computing power, and screen size. In this paper, we
   describe the experience of the research and development team designing,
   implementing and evaluating Amulet - an open-hardware, open-software
   wrist-worn computing device - and its experience using Amulet to deploy
   mHealth apps in the field. In the past five years the team conducted 11
   studies in the lab and in the field, involving 204 participants and
   collecting over 77,780 hours of sensor data. We describe the technical
   issues the team encountered and the lessons they learned, and conclude
   with a set of recommendations. We anticipate the experience described
   herein will be useful for the development of other research-oriented
   computing platforms. It should also be useful for researchers interested
   in developing and deploying mHealth applications, whether with the
   Amulet system or with other wearable platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The posit number system is proposed as a replacement of IEEE
   floating-point numbers. It is a floating-point system that trades
   exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the
   numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the
   expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several
   works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of
   applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand
   encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of
   the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit
   system that include performance and resource consumption.
   To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware
   implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++
   templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently
   implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size
   posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of
   the ``quire{''}, a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of
   products. The proposed library includes the first open-source
   parameterized hardware quire.
   This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit
   implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still,
   standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much
   larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The
   cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a
   Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point.}},

Abstract = {{Deeply embedded applications require low-power, low-cost hardware that
   fits within stringent area constraints. Deep learning has many potential
   uses in these domains, but introduces significant inefficiencies
   stemming from off-chip DRAM accesses of model weights. Ideally, models
   would fit entirely on-chip. However, even with compression, memory
   requirements for state-of-the-art models make on-chip inference
   impractical. Due to increased density, emerging eNVMs are one promising
   solution.
   We present MaxNVM, a principled co-design of sparse encodings,
   protective logic, and fault-prone MLC eNVM technologies (i.e., RRAM and
   CTT) to enable highly-efficient DNN inference. We find bit reduction
   techniques (e.g., clustering and sparse compression) increase weight
   vulnerability to faults. This limits the capabilities of MLC eNVM. To
   circumvent this limitation, we improve storage density (i.e.,
   bits-per-cell) with minimal overhead using protective logic. Tradeoffs
   between density and reliability result in a rich design space. We show
   that by balancing these techniques, the weights of large networks are
   able to reasonably fit on-chip. Compared to a naive, single-level-cell
   eNVM solution, our highly-optimized MLC memory systems reduce weight
   area by up to 29x. We compare our technique against NVDLA, a
   state-of-the-art industry-grade CNN accelerator, and demonstrate up to
   3.2x reduced power and up to 3.5x reduced energy per ResNet50 inference.}},

Abstract = {{Small clinics in low-middle-income countries frequently lack the
   financial and technical resources to support patient-record
   automation-relying instead on paper records to track patient visits.
   Earlier successes introducing automated solutions into these clinics
   often eroded quickly after external support was withdrawn. The piClinic
   Console is designed to automate key aspects of patient information
   management in small, limited-resource clinics so as to introduce
   automation into a clinic in a way that the clinic can sustain with
   little or no additional support. Unlike previous efforts to scale down
   existing medical records systems for a small clinic, the piClinic
   Console was developed to include only the functions that benefit most
   from automation. The design was implemented to work on low-cost hardware
   to minimize initial cost and dependence on external support. After
   encouraging laboratory test results, this design was tested in four
   Honduran clinics to evaluate the users' experiences and the utility of
   the design. Clinic response was universally positive; however, field
   testing identified that success relied on accommodating the different
   roles in the clinic, supporting at least one printer, and enabling
   multiple users to access the system from multiple devices.}},

   via a provided USB-SPI interface. The driver board controls up to 100
   channels simultaneously with square-wave signals up to 20 Vpp with
   pi/1024 phase resolution and 10 bit amplitude resolution. Several phased
   arrays can be linked via a provided (IC)-C-2 interface to increase the

Abstract = {{Modern computer systems are becoming faster, more efficient, and
   increasingly interconnected with each generation. Thus, these platforms
   grow more complex, with new features continually introducing the
   possibility of new bugs. Although the semiconductor industry employs a
   combination of different verification techniques to ensure the security
   of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, a growing number of increasingly
   sophisticated attacks are starting to leverage cross-layer bugs. These
   attacks leverage subtle interactions between hardware and software, as
   recently demonstrated through a series of real-world exploits that
   affected all major hardware vendors.
   In this paper, we take a deep dive into microarchitectural security from
   a hardware designer's perspective by reviewing state-of-the-art
   approaches used to detect hardware vulnerabilities at design time. We
   show that a protection gap currently exists, leaving chip designs
   vulnerable to software-based attacks that can exploit these hardware
   vulnerabilities. Inspired by real-world vulnerabilities and insights
   from our industry collaborator (a leading chip manufacturer), we
   construct the first representative testbed of real-world
   software-exploitable RTL bugs based on RISC-V SoCs. Patching these bugs
   may not always be possible and can potentially result in a product
   recall. Based on our testbed, we conduct two extensive case studies to
   analyze the effectiveness of state-of-the-art security verification
   approaches and identify specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we
   call HardFails, which these approaches fail to detect. Through our work,
   we focus the spotlight on specific limitations of these approaches to
   propel future research in these directions. We envision our RISC-V
   testbed of RTL bugs providing a rich exploratory ground for future
   research in hardware security verification and contributing to the
   open-source hardware landscape.}},

Abstract = {{To be secure, cryptographic algorithms crucially rely on the underlying
   hardware to avoid inadvertent leakage of secrets through timing side
   channels. Unfortunately, such timing channels are ubiquitous in modern
   hardware, due to its labyrinthine fast-paths and optimizations. A
   promising way to avoid timing vulnerabilities is to devise-and
   verify-conditions under which a hardware design is free of timing
   variability, i.e., executes in constant-time. In this paper, we present
   IODINE: a clock-precise, constant-time approach to eliminating timing
   side channels in hardware. IODINE succeeds in verifying various open
   source hardware designs in seconds and with little developer effort.
   IODINE also discovered two constant-time violations: one in a
   floating-point unit and another one in an RSA encryption module.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{173549-173558}},
Abstract = {{A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a
   multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both
   the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and
   steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external
   disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds
   is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to
   guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position.
   Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired
   attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque
   due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind
   disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then
   applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time
   convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed
   controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a
   quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to
   validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as
   well as robustness under disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for
   controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into
   ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to
   create curricula in a wide range of disciplines. Controlled-environment
   devices are increasing their functionalities as well as improving their
   accessibility. Traditionally, building one of these devices from scratch
   implies knowledge in fields such as mechanical engineering, digital
   electronics, programming, and energy management. However, the
   requirements of an effective controlled-environment device for personal
   use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper presents the
   OpenAgT Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size platform,
   which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also hobbyists,
   makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12). The
   PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that
   can be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis.
   Thanks to its modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of technologies such as the Internet of Things and
   Big Data, agriculture is entering the digital age. Modern information
   technology and intelligent equipment are the development direction of
   agriculture. In this paper, a remote-control system for greenhouse
   environment was developed based on Raspberry Pi, MySQL and Android. The
   system consists of a greenhouse control system (subsystem A), an
   environment monitoring system (subsystem B), a MySQL remote database
   (subsystem C), and an Android monitoring software (subsystem D). The
   subsystem A is used to implement automatic fertigation and collect data
   from subsystem B, which will be uploaded to cloud server database
   (subsystem C). The subsystem B is used to monitor the environmental
   parameters in the greenhouse such as air temperature/humidity, soil
   temperature/humidity etc. The subsystem C is used for storage of
   greenhouse environment data and communication between subsystem B and
   subsystem D. The subsystem D is used for data visualization including
   real-time display, storage and analysis of greenhouse environmental
   data, and remote control of fertigation system including the EC/pH
   control of the fertigation solution, irrigation scheduling, and
   fertigation settings. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control
   algorithm is used for the fertigation process of the subsystem A. The
   low-power LoRa technology is used for subsystem B to achieve low-power
   long-distance data transmission, which is especially suitable to
   greenhouses. All monitoring settings can be operated remotely by users.

Abstract = {{Nowadays, industrial automation systems are mostly used with proprietary
   hardware and software. Creating such systems requires relatively large
   costs. This is a problem when designing control systems with a limited
   budget, which are created, for example, in developing countries or small
   businesses. Currently, there have been opportunities to create low-cost
   automation systems by using solutions distributed on the basis of
   open-source and open-hardware. The work reviews the most important
   solutions and presents examples of their use in automation systems. (C)

Abstract = {{The aging of insulation materials in GIS leads to a series of electrical
   problems. As a fully enclosed device, GIS faces extremely complex
   repairing problems once an accident occurs comparing with the separated
   open equipment. The root cause of this problem is multifaceted,
   including not only the high voltage issues, but also the environmental
   factors in operation such as temperature, mechanical vibration, etc. All
   these lead to the aging of insulation materials and the failure of the
   equipment. Therefore, it is important to analyze the aging state of the
   GIS spacer, especially the GIS spacers in service. In this paper, to
   evaluate the aging state of the GIS spacer in service, the structural
   properties, as well as electrical performance of insulating material
   obtained from a GIS spacer served more than 15 years are characterized
   and compared with that of a new GIS spacer. To investigate the change in
   electrical properties, dielectric loss test, polarization current,
   surface resistance, and partial discharge measurement are delivered. And
   thermal characterizations including DSC, TGA and IR are also delivered
   to investigate the structure change of the insulation epoxy. The results
   show that the aging effect reduces the surface resistances and increases
   the dielectric loss, polarization current and partial discharge. And
   with the service time increases, the glass transition temperature and
   the thermal decomposition temperature of the GIS spacer declines.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with few centimeters of
   diameter and sub-10 Watts of total power budget, have so far been
   considered incapable of running sophisticated visual-based autonomous
   navigation software without external aid from base-stations, ad-hoc
   local positioning infrastructure, and powerful external computation
   servers. In this work, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge,
   the first 27 g nano-UAV system able to run aboard an end-to-end,
   closed-loop visual pipeline for autonomous navigation based on a
   state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, built upon the open-source
   CrazyFlie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. Our visual navigation engine is enabled by
   the combination of an ultra-low power computing device (the GAP8
   system-on-chip) with a novel methodology for the deployment of deep
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We enable onboard real-time
   execution of a state-of-the-art deep CNN at up to 18 Hz. Field
   experiments demonstrate that the system's high responsiveness prevents
   collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles up to a flight speed of 1.5
   m/s. In addition, we also demonstrate the capability of our visual
   navigation engine of fully autonomous indoor navigation on a 113m
   previously unseen path. To share our key findings with the embedded and
   robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous
   nano-UAVs, we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic video surveillance systems are usually designed to detect
   anomalous objects being present in a scene or behaving dangerously. In
   order to perform adequately, they must incorporate models able to
   achieve accurate pattern recognition in an image, and deep learning
   neural networks excel at this task. However, exhaustive scan of the full
   image results in multiple image blocks or windows to analyze, which
   could make the time performance of the system very poor when implemented
   on low cost devices. This paper presents a system which attempts to
   detect abnormal moving objects within an area covered by a 360 degrees
   camera. The decision about the block of the image to analyze is based on
   a mixture distribution composed of two components: a uniform probability
   distribution, which represents a blind random selection, and a mixture
   of Gaussian probability distributions. Gaussian distributions represent
   windows in the image where anomalous objects were detected previously
   and contribute to generate the next window to analyze close to those
   windows of interest. The system is implemented on a Raspberry Pi
   microcontroller-based board, which enables the design and implementation
   of a low-cost monitoring system that is able to perform image
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are devices that use brain signals for
   control or communication. Since they don't require movement of any part
   of the body, BCI are the natural choice for assisted communication when
   a person is unable to move.
   In this article, BCI based communicator for persons in locked-in state
   is described. It is based on P300 brain response of the user, thus does
   not require prior training, movement or imagination of movement.
   Auditory paradigm is selected in order to apply the communicator in
   cases where visual ability is also impaired. The communicator was
   designed to prove also whether low cost hardware with reduced electrode
   set could be used efficiently in everyday environment, without the need
   for expert personnel.
   The design of the communicator is described first, followed by detailed
   analyses of the performance when used by either healthy or disabled
   subjects. It is shown that auditory paradigm is the primary factor that
   limits the accuracy of communication. Hardware characteristics and
   reduced electrode set influence the accuracy in a negative way as well,
   while different questions and answer types produce no major differences.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature is an important source of information for personal health,
   weather forecasting, and thermal management in buildings and computing
   infrastructure, etc. Temperature measurement can be achieved via
   low-cost hardware with reasonable accuracy. However, large-scale
   distributed thermal sensing is non-trivial and currently relies on
   dedicated hardware. In this paper, we design the first software sonic
   thermometer (SST) using commercial-off-the-shelf acoustic enabled
   devices. We utilize on-board dual microphones on commodity mobile
   devices to estimate sound speed, which has a known relationship with
   temperature. SST is portable, contactless, and cost-effective, making it
   suitable for ubiquitous sensing. We implement SST on an Android smart
   phone and an acoustic sensing platform. Evaluation results show that SST
   can achieve a median accuracy of 0.5 degrees C even at varying humidity
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in positional tracking systems for virtual and augmented
   reality have opened up the possibilities for ubiquitous motion capture
   technology in the consumer market. However, for many applications such
   as in performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine, these
   systems remain too bulky, expensive, and limited to tracking a few
   objects at a time. In this work, we present a small wireless device that
   takes advantage of existing HTC Vive lighthouse tracking technology to
   provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking
   capabilities. This open hardware and open software project contains
   several elements, and the latest contributions described in this paper
   include: (1) a characterization of the optical distortions of the
   lighthouses, (2) a new cross-platform WebBLE interface, and (3) a
   real-time in-browser visualization. We also introduce new possibilities
   with an adaptive calibration to estimate transformation matrices of
   lighthouses, and an FPGA approach to improve precision and adaptability.
   Finally, we show how the new developments reduce setup costs and
   increase the accessibility of our tracking technology.}},

Abstract = {{Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults
   worldwide. Frequent complaints from the users of modern hearing aids
   include poor speech intelligibility in noisy environments and high cost,
   among other issues. However, the signal processing and audiological
   research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by
   proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and
   the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical
   environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and
   enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have
   developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech
   Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete
   OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to
   user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and
   advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It
   serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware,
   enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In
   addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality
   electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals
   closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in
   a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation
   in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Dexterous multi-fingered robotic hands can perform a wide range of
   manipulation skills, making them an appealing component for
   general-purpose robotic manipulators. However, such hands pose a major
   challenge for autonomous control, due to the high dimensionality of
   their configuration space and complex intermittent contact interactions.
   In this work, we propose deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) as a
   scalable solution for learning complex, contact rich behaviors with
   multi-fingered hands. Deep RL provides an end-to-end approach to
   directly map sensor readings to actions, without the need for task
   specific models or policy classes. We show that contact-rich
   manipulation behavior with multi-fingered hands can be learned by
   directly training with model-free deep RL algorithms in the real world,
   with minimal additional assumption and without the aid of simulation. We
   learn to perform a variety of tasks on two different low-cost hardware
   platforms entirely from scratch, and further study how the learning can
   be accelerated by using a small number of human demonstrations. Our
   experiments demonstrate that complex multi-fingered manipulation skills
   can be learned in the real world in about 4-7 hours for most tasks, and
   that demonstrations can decrease this to 2-3 hours, indicating that
   direct deep RL training in the real world is a viable and practical
   alternative to simulation and model-based control.

Abstract = {{The measurement of geometric deviations within large-size products is a
   challenging topic. One of the most applied technique compares the
   nominal product with the digitalization of real product obtained by a
   reverse engineering process. Digitalization of big geometric models is
   usually performed by means of multiple acquisitions from different
   scanning locations. Therefore, digitalization needs to correctly place
   the acquired point clouds in 3D digital environment. For this purpose,
   it is very important identifying the exact scanning location in order to
   correctly realign point clouds and generate an accurate 3D CAD model.
   The present paper faces the locating problem of a handling device for
   reverse engineering scanning systems. It proposes a locating method by
   using sensor data fusion based on Kalman filter, implemented in Matlab
   environment by using a low-cost equipment.}},

   components of hardware and software will be presented. This device has
   been used to measure voltages and currents of a low-voltage (LV)
   networks, on which a virtually unlimited number of sensors can be added,
   and the device is assembled of components available on electronic
   components Internet. The used hardware for this project is based on
   Arduino UNO R3 motherboard and peripheral sensors needed for measurement
   of the mentioned data. The Arduino motherboard is not only the sole
   peace of hardware, but it can also act as a Wi-Fi router for the devices
   and the laptop used for data presentation and server side computations.
   The server is programmed in Java programming language and is open
   source. Main goal was to make smart meter by the ``Do It Yourself{''}
   method spending as much less founds as it is possible, by keeping user
   friendly interface, data validity, accuracy of measurement and ease of
   use for final user. Data gathering is achieved in almost 1 ms which is
   excellent for custom made device. However, the measured values should be
   calculated to RMS values to be usable for energy analyzes and further

Abstract = {{The paper describes the possibilities of data acquisition and data
   processing from optical sensing systems. There are some data acquisition
   cards and their disadvantages when used for more complex single fiber
   sensor systems in the paper. It is suitable to use some open source
   hardware because commercially available data acquisition cards are more
   complex and universal which means they have several different
   inputs/outputs and large dimensions. STEMLab 125-14 (Red Pitaya) appears
   to be the most suitable solution because offers 2 analog inputs and 2
   analog outputs.Compare to standard data processing systems, this is
   supposed to be an advantage in preprocessing data using programmable
   logic. This can reduce the volume of transmitted data and can also speed
   up processing. Thus, the measurement system will be smaller and cheaper.
   The device contains DA converters, therefore pulses might be generated
   using the same clock which enables synchronization of backscatter
   signal.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, energy consumption and especially energy saving, are topics of
   great importance. Recent news regarding global warming has increased the
   need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy
   consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential
   buildings accounts for up to 68\% of housing energy consumption.
   Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and
   ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland.
   In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a
   literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving
   in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall
   knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall
   conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts
   toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf
   devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap
   to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it
   is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies
   provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and
   open architectures with the development of prototype systems for
   gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the
   specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for
   modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be
   taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally
   sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in semiconductor miniaturization are an important driver for
   Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since their invention in the
   1980s. The increasing number of available on chip logic resources on one
   hand and on the other hand a decrease in part costs let the FPGA market
   grow steadily in recent years. It comes thus at no surprise that more
   and more microprocessors are integrated into programmable logic devices
   as they represent the central functionality in many digital systems. In
   parallel to these technological developments the open-source hardware
   community grew steadily in the last two decades. More than hundred
   open-source CPU cores can thus be found and selecting a core for a
   design project has to be done with care. In this work we thus want to
   focus on open-source 32-bit CPU IP cores suitable for FPGAs and which
   support the upcoming free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture
   that has some interesting advantages when compared to commercial CPU
   cores (as will be outlined in the paper). An overview on available
   projects and activities will be given and evaluation results for a
   selection of cores will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) has been increasing recently owing
   to its flexibility in allowing an efficient and economical approach to
   promote real-time emulation. In the field of power electronics, HIL can
   be a useful solution since it allows testing control techniques in real
   controller devices without running the risk of damaging expensive
   components. However, real-time emulation requires powerful hardware to
   be performed, which has the drawback of increasing the HIL
   implementation's cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-cost HIL
   implementation for real-time emulation and control of a boost converter
   that uses the STM32 high-performance microcontroller unit (MCU).
   Stand-alone simulation on PSIM software and validation using an
   experimental boost converter are executed.}},

Abstract = {{With the emerging trend of the Internet of Things and Smart City
   environments, new trends have arisen in building applications, too. The
   current approach to application development, known as monolithic
   architecture, is not suitable for the newest appliances. Recently, the
   microservice-based application architecture has emerged as a potential
   solution that could meet the imposed challenges. In order to educate new
   generations of software and IT engineers to be able to develop such
   microservice-based applications, educators at universities should
   establish an efficient platform to ensure this process. This article
   presents the portable and lightweight platform for teaching application
   development based on microservices. The platform is focused on
   supporting lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocols, such as
   MQTT, and built-on open-source hardware development boards such as
   Arduino/Genuino. This Smart City learning platform is designed to enable
   the collaborative development of systems, applications and services for
   the cities of the future, and it should be efficient enough to support
   the learning of all the necessary skills that can be used for the
   development of complex and large-scale systems. The architecture of the
   proposed platform, as well as its elements are presented in this
   article.}},

Abstract = {{1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently become the
   state-of-the-art technique for crucial signal processing applications
   such as patient-specific ECG classification, structural health
   monitoring, anomaly detection in power electronics circuitry and
   motor-fault detection. This is an expected outcome as there are numerous
   advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D CNN instead of a
   conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D CNNs can
   be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D
   deep CNNs, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need
   datasets with massive size, e.g., in the ``Big Data{''} scale in order
   to prevent the well-known ``overfitting{''} problem. 1D CNNs can
   directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage,
   vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre-or postprocessing such as
   feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc.
   Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such
   adaptive 1D CNNs that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar
   multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware
   implementation is feasible. This paper reviews the major signal
   processing applications of compact 1D CNNs with a brief theoretical
   background. We will present their state-of-the-art performances and
   conclude with focusing on some major properties.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing need for testing and prototyping designs under more
   realistic conditions is responsible for the advancement of new types of
   simulation. In this scenario, one type of simulation which has gained
   high notoriety and applicability is the one known as
   Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL). This technique allows real and virtual
   components of a system to be tested together, making it possible to
   perform tests under realistic (and even extreme) conditions without
   harming the real system or a prototype built only for testing. The
   objective of this work was to develop a low-cost HIL simulation platform
   to be used for many different applications, unlike most commercial ones,
   that are developed for one exclusive field of application, such as
   automotive, aerospace, power electronics, among others. Thus, the main
   contribution of this work is the project of a HIL platform capable of
   simulating different types of systems, making it possible to validate
   embedded control strategies designed for them. Two different
   applications are tested in order to validate the HIL platform: an active
   suspension and a satellite attitude control air bearing table, both
   controlled using a discrete Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) designed
   for each of them.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral images are a widely used remote sensing technique. These
   images are three-dimensional data structures, where the x and y axes
   contain spatial information and the z-axis contains spectral information
   or image bands. Usually, these bands can reach the order of hundreds,
   generating a considerable amount of information. Due to storage
   limitations and communication bandwidth, the use of compression
   techniques becomes essential. For spatial applications, a standard
   commonly used in the literature is CCSDS 123, developed by the
   Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, which describes the
   algorithm for lossless compression of hyperspectral images. In this
   context, we implemented the prediction stage of the CCSDS 123 algorithm
   in the Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA. The developed processor provides a good
   trade-off to meet real-time requirements at low-cost.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) have been successfully applied to a
   wide range of real-world problems. However, they suffer from some design
   issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware
   platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the
   IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of
   the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy
   community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a
   hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an
   FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the
   open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been
   developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of
   embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016
   FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this
   drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the
   design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems.
   In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi,
   Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote
   computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they
   run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for
   ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other
   hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to
   automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in
   order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific
   knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills.
   The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c)

Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US)-guided renal biopsy is a critically important tool in
   the evaluation and management of non-malignant renal pathologies with
   diagnostic and prognostic significance. It requires a good biopsy
   technique and skill to safely and consistently obtain high yield biopsy
   samples for tissue analysis. This project aims to develop a virtual
   trainer to help clinicians to improve procedural skill competence in
   real-time ultrasound-guided renal biopsy. This paper presents a
   cost-effective, high-fidelity trainer built using low-cost hardware
   components and open source visualization and interactive simulation
   libraries: interactive medical simulation toolkit (iMSTK) and 3D Slicer.
   We used a physical mannequin to simulate the tactile feedback that
   trainees experience while scanning a real patient and to provide
   trainees with spatial awareness of the US scanning plane with respect to
   the patient's anatomy. The ultrasound probe and biopsy needle were
   modeled using commonly used clinical tools and were instrumented to
   communicate with the simulator. 3D Slicer was used to visualize an image
   sliced from a pre-acquired 3-D ultrasound volume based on the location
   of the probe, with a realistic needle rendering. The simulation engine
   in iMSTK modeled the interaction between the needle and the virtual
   tissue to generate visual deformations on the tissue and tactile forces
   on the needle which are transmitted to the needle that the user holds.
   Initial testing has shown promising results with respect to quality of
   simulated images and system responsiveness. Further evaluation by
   clinicians is planned for the next stage.}},

Abstract = {{High accuracy digitalisation of geometric models, related to big size
   objects, usually is performed by means of multiple acquisitions from
   different scanning locations. It needs to correctly place the acquired
   point clouds in 3D digital environment. For this purpose, it is very
   important identifying the exact scanning location in order to correctly
   realign point clouds and automatically generate an accurate 3D CAD
   model.
   The present paper focuses on design and prototype of a mobile handling
   device for reverse engineering scanning systems, named Dedalo. It is
   able to locate itself using a sensor fusion method based on a Kalman
   Filter. The sensor equipment is composed by wheel encoders and an
   ultrasonic sensor for measuring the distance from a known reference.
   Although Dedalo is equipped with low-cost hardware, results have showed
   a location accuracy by 0,1\% error/meter, better than each sensor
   accuracy.}},

Pages = {{112269-112283}},
Abstract = {{Vector similarity searching consists of comparing a query vector against
   a high volume of entries in a reference data set, according to a chosen
   similarity metric such as the L1-norm, L2-norm, or Hamming distance.
   Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations
   are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse
   as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and
   prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered
   materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present,
   predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU)
   hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in
   massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a
   range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and
   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the
   availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely
   confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions.
   Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector
   similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined
   with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a
   custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth
   of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly
   arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software
   architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines
   implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows
   attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on
   both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit
   board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented
   and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and
   research in this area.}},

Abstract = {{In power generation systems the synchronization of an alternator with
   the electrical network are an important and critical task. This paper
   presents the design and building of an automatic three-phase alternator
   synchronizer based on a low-cost open-hardware Arduino platform. The
   synchronization is performed by means of measuring a phase voltage of
   both the synchronous generator and the electrical grid; then the
   measured voltages are conditioned and sent to the Arduino board, which
   is programmed to determine the correct moment to connect the alternator
   to the grid. To validate the prototype, a laboratory setup has been
   built with the alternator driven by a commercial dc drive. The design
   and practical implementation of the system is proposed as a
   project-based learning (PBL) activity for undergraduate final year
   students at the University of Bio-Bio, Chile. A description of the

Abstract = {{The syllabus for the mechanical engineering studies at Furtwangen
   University offers the elective ``Mechatronics in practice{''} for
   students in semesters 3 to 7. The course goal is to practically apply
   the previously obtained theoretical knowledge from courses like
   informatics, CAD and electronics to create a mechatronic system of
   medium complexity using low-cost hardware. The course is divided into
   two parts, where the first part consists of a 5-hour lecture introducing
   the students to Arduino programming with examples on how to control
   various hardware components and read signals from sensors. Each student
   group is given a set of motors and sensors that can be used in the
   introductory lecture and in the project task thereafter. In the second
   part of the course, the students are asked to define project milestones
   and allocate the various project tasks to solve the given assignment
   among the project members. The project progress and the meeting of the
   self-set milestones is then continuously evaluated by the course
   examiners during the course progression. The students are free to use
   the university 3D printers and laser cutter to build the necessary parts
   for their project. The various group solutions are presented to the
   other groups in a final event. Course assignments so far included a
   battle bot, a line-follower robot and a drawing robot. The course
   experience showed that the various student groups found very diverse
   solutions to the given tasks with a high quality of execution. The
   student feedback is collected using a questionnaire. The results of that
   survey showed a very high satisfaction with the course. Among the
   various reasons for that was the motivation the students gained through
   the practical and fun assignments, the possibility to test their
   solution against the solution of other groups (through e.g. a fight
   between battle bots or a timed lap for the line-follower robots) and the
   chance to apply their theoretical knowledge in a practical project. The
   survey also showed that students invested more time in that course than
   what is usually required in a course of that scope because they tried to
   solve the given task as best as possible.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular devices support various technical features and services for 2G,
   3G, 4G and upcoming 5G networks. For example, these technical features
   contain physical layer throughput categories, radio protocol
   information, security algorithm, carrier aggregation bands and type of
   services such as GSM-R, Voice over LTE etc. In the cellular security
   standardisation context, these technical features and network services
   termed as device capabilities and exchanged with the network during the
   device registration phase. In this paper, we study device capabilities
   information specified for 4G and 5G devices and their role in
   establishing security association between the device and network. Our
   research results reveal that device capabilities are exchanged with the
   network before the authentication stage without any protection and not
   verified by the network. Consequently, we present three novel classes of
   attacks exploiting unprotected device capabilities information in 4G and
   upcoming 5G networks -identification attacks, bidding down attacks, and
   battery drain attacks against cellular devices. We implement proofof-
   concept attacks using low-cost hardware and software setup to evaluate
   their impact against commercially available 4G devices and networks. We
   reported identified vulnerabilities to the relevant standardisation
   bodies and provide countermeasure to mitigate device capabilities
   attacks in 4G and upcoming 5G networks.}},

Abstract = {{The use of unmanned aquatic surface vehicles as a tool for exploring and
   inspecting bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds is a research area
   of growing interest. However, using real aquatic vehicles to test and
   develop software and control systems is often not feasible for many
   researchers, due to the limited access to testing pools and the lack of
   availability of low-cost, off-the-shelf surface vehicles. An alternative
   is to utilise software simulations, but these can fail to test important
   system features, such as error characteristics of real sensors, on-board
   processing and the effect of external disturbances on the performance of
   positional control systems. The contribution of the present paper is a
   third method that allows the robot's full software system including real
   world sensors to be tested without the need for pool facilities. This is
   achieved by mapping the physics of an omnidirectional aquatic surface
   robot onto an omnidirectional ground vehicle. A dynamic model of the
   aquatic surface vehicle is deployed within an embedded control system on
   the ground vehicle, meaning that for a given command signal ( applied
   force) the motion of the ground vehicle mimics the motion that would
   occur if it were a surface vehicle floating on a body of water.
   Validation tests demonstrate that the ground vehicle's dynamic behaviour
   matches well with that of a specific aquatic surface vehicle that was
   utilised in this study. However, by changing the dynamic model within
   the embedded control system, the ground vehicle is able to approximate
   the motion of any aquatic surface vehicle. The newly constructed ground
   robot is now an open-source and open-hardware platform.}},

   engineering program, practical exercises and educational laboratories
   play an equally vital role in educating knowledgeable and skillful
   engineers that can immediately enter the industry without requiring
   extensive practical training. However, with the ongoing rapid
   advancements in technology, a constant challenge faced by educators is
   the need to design new and relevant laboratory projects. This can be a
   time-consuming and costly affair, which, if neglected, will lead to
   outdated laboratory projects and a degradation in learning outcomes for
   the students. Here, we present an approach that can overcome this
   challenge by means of low-cost modern equipment and supervised student
   labor, exemplified by the development of three different laboratory
   projects designed for electrical engineering students.}},

Abstract = {{With expansion of neural network (NN) applications lowering their
   hardware implementation cost becomes an urgent task especially in
   back-end applications where the power-supply is limited. Stochastic
   computing (SC) is a promising solution to realize low-cost hardware
   designs. Implementation of matrix multiplication has been a bottleneck
   in previous stochastic neural networks (SC-NNs). In this paper, we
   introduce spintronic components into the design of SC-NNs. A novel
   spin-CMOS matrix multiplier is proposed in which the stochastic
   multiplications are performed by CMOS AND gates while the sum of
   products is implemented by spintronic compressor gates. The experimental
   results indicate that compared to the conventional binary
   implementations the proposed hybrid spin-CMOS architecture can achieve
   over 125x, 4.5x and 43x reduction in terms of power, energy and area
   consumptions, respectively. Moreover, compared to previous CMOS-based
   SC-NNs, our design saves the power by 3.1x -7.3x, reduces energy
   consumption by 3.1x -7.3x and decreases area by 1.4x -7.6x while
   maintaining similar recognition rates.}},

   Therefore, it is especially important to thoroughly test and profile the

   devices due to their intrusiveness. This paper proposes a low-cost
   Hardware Assisted Tracing testBED (HATBED) to enable non-intrusive
   tracing and profiling for embedded networked sensor systems independent

Abstract = {{Artificial pancreas control is an important research area in the
   biomedical field. However, it is dangerous to test new control
   algorithms on humans in order to improve the performance of the control
   system. This paper presents the results of using an open-source low-cost
   hardware in the loop platform to test different control strategies for
   artificial pancreas research. An Arduino platform was selected as the
   main device to implement the real time differential equations solver
   needed for the HIL simulation. The platform was successfully tested with
   both a PID controller and an LQR controller. The code and schematics of
   the platform are available upon request. (C) 2019, IFAC (International

Year = {{2019}},

Pages = {{74586-74601}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes open-source hardware Posit Arithmetic Core Generator
   (PACoGen) for the recently developed universal number posit number
   system, along with a set of pipelined architectures. The posit number
   system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is
   defined by a composition of varying length ``regime-bit{''} and
   ``exponent-bit{''} (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size).
   This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size
   and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware
   design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number
   system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very
   limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this
   view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL
   generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open
   source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and
   division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code
   respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and
   exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further,
   pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are
   also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication,
   and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are
   demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as
   Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform. The PACoGen would open a gateway for
   further posit arithmetic hardware exploration and evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmic rays represent not only a significant health risk to the crew of
   spacecraft and aircraft but also a fundamental phenomenon of basic
   research on the origin and composition of the universe. High-energy
   atmospheric physics is a newly opened research domain which focuses on
   research of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that can measurably contribute
   to the aircraft-crew irradiation according to the preliminary computer
   simulations. High-mountain observatories are suitable places for both
   the continual monitoring of cosmic radiation and the detection of
   ionizing radiation generated by lightning. Liulin Mobile Dosimetry Unit
   (MDU) is a silicon diode based radiation dosimeter developed by the team
   of Tsvetan Dachev at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, initially for
   the MIR space station. It is widely used as an instrument for radiation
   monitoring on board aircraft, on high altitude observatories as well as
   for example for ion fragmentation studies. The AIRDOS dosimeter is an
   open source device for measurement in low intensity mixed ionising
   radiation fields. In its aircraft version, it houses silicon PIN diode
   as a radiation detector, an electronics for conversion of the signal to
   the pulse-height spectra, Global Positioning System (GPS) module, memory
   card and batteries for one-month monitoring. The hardware design of
   AIRDOS is built on the Open hardware modular platform MLAB. the firmware
   is written in Open Software platform Processing. Full documentation is
   freely available. Two AIRDOS devices have been installed at Basic
   Enviromental Observtory (BEO) Moussala in December 2017, complementing
   the radiation and environment monitoring instruments already available,
   including the Liulin MDU. Preliminary results of comparative
   measurements of radiation environment at BEO Moussala using the AIRDOS
   units and Liulin MDU will be presented. The results from BEO Moussala
   will be compared with data acquired on hoard aircraft.}},

Title = {{Communication Technologies Based on Voluntary Blinks: Assessment and
   Design}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{70770-70798}},
Abstract = {{Some people with severe disabilities are confined in a state in which
   communication is virtually impossible, being reduced to communicating
   with their eyes or using sophisticated systems that translate thoughts
   into words. The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are
   suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost.
   More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and
   translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for
   example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four
   different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals
   (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video
   processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without
   disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and
   method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short
   blinks). The best accuracy (99.3\%) was obtained using
   Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9\%)
   and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy.
   Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double
   blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the
   time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a
   potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained
   similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology
   and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks,
   respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been
   developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also
   been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the
   reviewed literature.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of mobile and wearable computing technology has opened up
   tremendous opportunities for health and wellness applications. It is
   increasingly possible for individuals to wear devices that can sense
   their physiology or health-related behaviors, collecting valuable data
   in support of diagnosis, treatment, public health, or other
   applications. From a researcher's point of view, the commercial
   availability of these ``mHealth{''} devices has made it feasible to
   conduct scientific studies of health conditions and to explore
   health-related interventions. It remains difficult, however, to conduct
   systems work or other experimental research involving the hardware,
   software, security, and networking aspects of mobile and wearable
   technology. In this paper we describe the Amulet platform, an
   open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device designed
   specifically for mHealth applications. Our position is that the Amulet
   is an inexpensive platform for research and education, and we encourage
   the mHealth community to explore its potential.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the neural correlates of sensory processing such as touch
   and temperature sensation is important for basic and clinical
   neuroscience. In addition, to preserve perceptive functions such as
   touch, which has a critical role in the regulation of the movement,
   mapping the somatosensory cortex is critical in surgeries involving
   tumor and epileptogenic zone resection. Novel and low cost hardware
   solutions are needed that can help clinicians to study natural and
   pathological levels of behavior and map somatosensory cortex in an
   objective manner. In this study, a microcontroller-based system was
   developed which can deliver vibrotactile stimulation to all five fingers
   of the hand. The system also delivers hot and cold temperature sensation
   through stacked thermoelectric modules. In order to synchronize the
   stimulation onset with neural data which can be acquired with a
   bioamplifier simultaneously, the microcontroller transfers a trigger
   signal through its digital I/O port or via universal serial bus (USB)
   with low latency. Our preliminary results demonstrate that our system
   can be used to study sensory processing with improved temporal precision
   in an objective fashion.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Abstract = {{Emerging power system protection and control applications require
   faster-responding measurements and more accurate knowledge of the actual
   latency of the measurement and communications systems. A new method for
   accurately determining the reporting latency of a phasor measurement
   unit (PMU) has been developed and demonstrated. This method operates in
   real-time, works passively for any existing PMU without requiring
   changes to the PMU hardware or software, and it is very
   accurate-providing a measurement uncertainty of <500 ns in many cases,
   significantly surpassing the 0.002 s accuracy requirement in the most
   recent IEEE Synchrophasor standard. Only low-cost hardware and open
   source software are required. It is particularly important to understand
   end-to-end system latency, including the impact of local and wide-area
   communications, rather than just the latency of the PMU device; the
   proposed method also supports such practical measurements. It is
   therefore shown how this advance can be used to enable efficient, but
   realistic, cross-domain power system simulation studies, which
   incorporate measurement and communications delays. These capabilities
   address complexity and uncertainty in the design and operation of future
   PMU-based protection and control functions for new smart grid services.}},

   Real-Time and Long-Term Imaging of Microplates in Incubator}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{58764-58779}},
Abstract = {{Microplate (i.e. microwell plate) is a flat plate that has a specific
   number of wells to be used as small test tubes in cell-culture studies.
   In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly
   skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in
   microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and
   by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of
   contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to
   use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however,
   cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present
   the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible
   inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators.
   The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator
   imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture
   bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor,
   an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes.
   In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting
   algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5
   mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without
   using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the
   system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast
   cancer cell lines.}},

Title = {{People tracking with range cameras using density maps and 2D blob
   splitting}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{285-295}},
Abstract = {{A robust method is proposed for people tracking using range cameras:
   Density Map Tracking with Blob Splitting (DMT-BS). It was designed
   primarily for worker safety in industrial environments, but can be used
   in other applications as well. Multiple cameras can easily be added to
   resolve occlusions and to enlarge the observed area. The method could be
   used to track any moving object in an otherwise static environment as
   the detection does not rely on a specific human model. Its strength lies
   in its simplicity, making the behavior predictable and opening
   possibilities to be implemented on low-cost hardware. From the point
   cloud delivered by the depth sensor, a 2D density map is formed in floor
   coordinates followed by basic 2D-tracking. Robustness of this tracking
   is enhanced using a simple but effective blob splitting technique. Tests
   show that the camera position, depth noise, and extrinsic calibration
   errors have little influence on the tracker's performance. The proposed
   method was tested on three depth tracking datasets, reaching
   significantly better MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy) scores
   when compared to two state-of-the-art depth-based trackers.}},

   energy. The device was fabricated using different types of silicone
   materials and membrane shapes. This exhibits experimentally a maximum
   vertical deformation of 13 mm and a tangential displacement of 10 mm at
   7 kPa. These two mechanically programmed movements open the possibility

Title = {{Spectrum Assignment in Hardware-Constrained Cognitive Radio IoT Networks
   Under Varying Channel-Quality Conditions}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{42816-42825}},
Abstract = {{The integration of cognitive radio (CR) technology with the future
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture is expected to allow effective
   massive IoT deployment by providing huge spectrum opportunities to the
   IoT devices. Several communication protocols have been proposed for the
   CR networks while ignoring the adjacent channel interference (ACI)
   problem by assuming sharp filters at the transmit and receive chains of
   each CR device. However, in practice, such an assumption is not feasible
   for low-cost hardware-constrained CR-capable IoT (CR-IoT) devices.
   Specifically, when a large number of CR-IoT devices are operating in the
   same vicinity, guard-band channels (GBs) are needed to mitigate the ACI
   problem, introducing GB adds constraints on the efficient use of
   spectrum and protocol design. In this paper, we develop a channel
   assignment mechanism for the hardware-constrained CR-IoT networks under
   time-varying channel conditions with GB-awareness. The objective of our
   assignment is to serve the largest possible number of CR-IoT devices by
   assigning the least number of idle channels to each device subject to
   rate demand and interference constraints. The proposed channel
   assignment in this paper is conducted on a per-block basis for the
   contending CR-IoT devices while considering the time-varying channel
   conditions for each CRIoT transmission over each idle channel, such that
   spectrum efficiency is improved. Specifically, our channel assignment
   problem is formulated as a binary linear programming problem, which is
   NP-hard. Thus, we propose a polynomial-time solution using a sequential
   fixing algorithm that achieves a suboptimal solution. The simulation
   results demonstrate that our proposed assignment provides significant
   increase in the number of served IoT devices over existing assignment
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Cars for disabled drivers consist of adapting their functionalities to
   be operated by hands, in a manner a paraplegic individual should rely
   only on their hands. This task can become difficult taking into account
   that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It
   can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of
   distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the
   functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic
   signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino and, afterwards, sent to a
   Raspberry Pi. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme
   Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to
   control automotive functionalities. Our work demonstrates the
   feasibility of real-time car functionalities control using
   electromyography and efficient low-cost hardware. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Precision Agriculture (PA), as the integration of information,
   communication and control technologies in agriculture, is growing day by
   day. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms offer
   advances to enhance PA connectivity. Nevertheless, their usage in this
   field is usually limited to specific scenarios of high cost, and they
   are not adapted to semi-arid conditions, or do not cover all PA
   management in an efficient way. For this reason, we propose a flexible
   platform able to cope with soilless culture needs in full recirculation
   greenhouses using moderately saline water. It is based on exchangeable
   low-cost hardware and supported by a three-tier open source software
   platform at local, edge and cloud planes. At the local plane,
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) interact with crop devices to gather data
   and perform real-time atomic control actions. The edge plane of the
   platform is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA tasks near the
   access network to increase system reliability against network access
   failures. Finally, the cloud platform collects current and past records
   and hosts data analytics modules in a FIWARE deployment. IoT protocols
   like Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) are used to communicate with CPS, while Next Generation
   Service Interface (NGSI) is employed for southbound and northbound
   access to the cloud. The system has been completely instantiated in a
   real prototype in frames of the EU DrainUse project, allowing the
   control of a real hydroponic closed system through managing software for
   final farmers connected to the platform. (C) 2018 IAgrE. Published by

Abstract = {{Defogging is an essential preprocessing technique for object detection
   in computer vision-based systems and has been widely used in outdoor
   surveillance system applications. This paper proposes an efficient
   defogging algorithm for both static images and videos. Considering
   real-time applications, the proposed defogging algorithm involves a
   low-cost hardware oriented design that is based on an atmospheric
   scattering model and dark channel prior. Compared with previous
   low-complexity techniques, simulation results indicated that the
   proposed design demonstrated superior performance in terms of
   quantitative and qualitative evaluations. A weighting technique and a
   contour preserving estimation approach are adopted alternately to refine
   the factors in the defogging process. Furthermore, in the atmospheric
   light estimation, an adjuster is applied to the video for preventing
   ``flicker{''} which means that the brightness changes dramatically
   between two neighbor frames in the video. Hence, the proposed algorithm
   is suitable for video defogging applications, which have not been dealt
   with in previous approaches. To achieve the requirement of real-time
   applications for both static and dynamic images, an implementation of
   seven-stage very-large-scale integration architecture for the proposed
   algorithm is presented. By using TSMC 0.13-um technology, the design
   yielded a processing rate of approximately 200 Mpixels/s.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to determine and verify the exact location
   of radiation therapy fields by using port-film and digital
   reconstruction radiograph (DRR) as a low-cost tool. Initially, an
   appropriate algorithm was written for the application of port film in
   the megavoltage beam irradiation. Detectable contrast was created for
   the image and then by using appropriate markers and developed written
   program by MATLAB as DRrPortRegistartion. Semi-automatic and automatic
   registration between port-film and DRR images were performed for pelvic
   and chest phantoms. Then, results were compared with electronic portal
   imaging device (EPID) images in similar conditions. By using this
   software, DRR and port film as treatment verification tools, the
   precision of treatment verification and the accuracy of radiation
   therapy fields were achieved in the extent of the millimeter. Validation
   results with EPID demonstrated that the mean absolute average error in
   angle is equal to 0.59 degrees, 1.70mm in the X-direction, and 2.42mm in
   the Y-direction. The results of this study illustrated that using this
   software and suitable low-cost hardware in the machines without EPID can
   increase the precision of treatment verification to the millimeter and
   it can be introduced as a suitable alternative for EPID in centers for
   increasing treatment accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras are well suited to motion detection and
   tracking objects due to their mobility. Motion detection approaches
   based on background difference have been the most used with fixed
   cameras because of the high quality of the achieved segmentation.
   However, time requirements and high costs prevent most of the algorithms
   proposed in literature from exploiting the background difference with
   PTZ cameras in real world applications, such as automatic surveillance.
   This paper presents a new algorithm to detect moving objects within an
   area covered by a PTZ camera while it is panning, tilting or zooming in
   or out. The low computational demands of the algorithm allow for its
   deployment to a Raspberry Pi microcontrollerbased board, which enables
   the design and implementation of a low-cost monitoring system that is
   able to perform real-time image processing. First, our system works
   offline to estimate the parameters of the motion detection model, which
   are written on the Raspberry Pi memory. Second, motion detection is
   performed online by the microcontroller. Experimental results using
   different moving objects classifiers (FANN, KNN, and SVM) confirm the
   good performance of this approach in terms of different classification
   performance measures (accuracy, F-measure, AUC, and sample processing
   time).}},

Abstract = {{The core-shell polymeric nanofiber, owing to its better controlled
   release of embedded or encapsulated drugs in contrast with the
   single-compartment nanofibers, has been extensively studied for
   biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and wound healing.
   Electrospinning with co-axial needles is the dominant technique to
   fabricate nanofiber mat, however, associated with potential limitations
   such as high voltage requirement, costly equipment, slow deposition
   rate, required trained personal, not suitable in situ fabrication, and
   direct deposition of core-shell nanofibers on the wound at patient
   bedside. To address the above limitations, the work aims to introduce a
   novel co-axial airbrushing method to fabricate core-shell nanofibers
   using a simple setup and low-cost equipment, yet having a unique ability
   for fabrication at patient bedside and direct deposition on wound bed.
   Air-brush with a coaxial needle is designed to flow two different
   polymers solution with model biomolecules through core {[}PEO
   (polyethylene oxide)/poly-DL-lactide/PCL (polycaprolactone)] and shell
   (PCL/PEO) needle for the fabrication of the model core-shell nanofiber.
   Various processing parameters such as flow rate, air pressure, working
   distance, and concentration of polymer solution which affect the
   morphology of core-shell nanofibers were studied and found to have a
   prominent effect. The PCL-PEO nanofiber possesses a defined shell and
   core structure, tunable sustained release behavior of model proteins
   (bovine serum albumin and basic fibroblast growth factor; bFGF), and
   improved mechanical strength. In vitro interaction of human bone
   marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells with core-shell fibers
   demonstrated the cytocompatibility and proliferative and differentiative
   (for bFGF loaded) properties of the core-shell nanofiber mat. Co-axial
   airbrushing can be used as a superior less-expensive technique for the
   fabrication of biomolecules/drug encapsulated core-shell fibers scaffold
   at patient bedside, which can mimic complex in vivo environment and
   could modulate cells behavior close to their in vivo condition for
   tissue regeneration and wound healing.}},

Title = {{A Real-Time Phase-Locking System for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques are entering widespread use
   for the investigation and treatment of a range of neurological and
   neuropsychiatric disorders. However, most current techniques are
   `open-loop', without feedback from target brain region activity; this
   limitation could contribute to heterogeneous effects seen for nominally
   `inhibitory' and `excitatory' protocols across individuals. More potent
   and consistent effects may ensue from closed-loop and, in particular,
   phase-locked brain stimulation. In this work, a closed-loop brain
   stimulation system is introduced that can analyze EEG data in real-time,
   provide a forecast of the phase of an underlying brain rhythm of
   interest, and control pulsed transcranial electromagnetic stimulation to
   deliver pulses at a specific phase of the target frequency band. The
   technique was implemented using readily available equipment such as a
   basic EEG system, a low-cost Arduino board and MATLAB scripts. The
   phase-locked brain stimulation method was tested in 5 healthy volunteers
   and its phase-locking performance evaluated at 0, 90, 180, and 270
   degree phases in theta and alpha frequency bands. On average phase
   locking values of 0.55 degrees +/- 0.11 degrees and 0.52 degrees +/-
   0.14 degrees and error angles of 11 degrees +/- 11 degrees and 3.3
   degrees +/- 18 degrees were achieved for theta and alpha stimulation,
   respectively. Despite the low-cost hardware implementation, signal
   processing time generated a phase delay of only 3.8 degrees for theta
   and 57 degrees for alpha stimulation, both readily accommodated in the
   pulse trigger algorithm. This work lays the methodological steps for
   achieving phase-locked brain stimulation for brief-pulse transcranial
   electrical stimulation (tES) and repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS), facilitating further research on the effect of
   stimulation phase for these techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines how decisions are made and justified within
   cultures of contribution using an ``operational pragmatics.{''}
   Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of
   resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and
   contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending
   towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal
   imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An
   examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community
   challenges these perspectives and shows how ``operational pragmatics{''}
   can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of
   principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates
   claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in
   technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware
   project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the
   challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary
   because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology
   development under capitalism.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural research involves study of the complex
   soil-plant-atmosphere-water system, and data relating to this system
   must be collected under often-harsh outdoor conditions in agricultural
   environments. Rapid advancements in electronic technologies in the last
   few decades, as well as more recent widespread proliferation and
   adoption of electronic sensing and communications, have created many
   options to address the needs of professional, as well as amateur,
   researchers. In this study, an agricultural research project was
   undertaken to collect data and examine the effects of different
   agronomic practices on yield, with the objectives being to develop a
   monitoring system to measure soil moisture and temperature conditions in
   field plots and to upload the data to an internet website. The developed
   system included sensor nodes consisting of sensors and electronic
   circuitry to read and transmit sensor data via radio and a cellular
   gateway to receive node data and forward the data to an internet website
   via cellular infrastructure. Microcontroller programs were written to
   control the nodes and gateway, and an internet website was configured to
   receive and display sensor data. The battery-powered sensor nodes cost
   \$170 each, including electronic circuitry and sensors, and they were
   operated throughout the cropping season with little maintenance on a
   single set of batteries. The solar-powered gateway cost \$163 to
   fabricate, plus an additional cost of \$2 per month for cellular network
   access. Wireless and cellular data transmissions were reliable,
   successfully transferring 95\% of sensor data to the internet website.
   Application of open-source hardware, wireless data transfer, and
   internet-based data access therefore offers many options and advantages
   for agricultural sensing and monitoring efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an
   increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the
   influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in
   terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and
   components (open hardware). This situation has produced different
   effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens,
   called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or
   build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above,
   the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way,
   it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT)
   node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to
   build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual
   design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor
   meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features
   different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using
   Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar
   panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and
   replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements
   such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart
   agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological
   phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to
   detect possible diseases within vineyards.}},

Abstract = {{In general, warehouses are used to store goods or products. In the
   Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very
   difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the
   available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this
   problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful
   because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in
   which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory
   management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions
   and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless
   communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse
   inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the
   transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the
   aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the
   architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the
   products attached to the tags with product information and their
   respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts
   as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system
   gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow.
   The web page which is built in accordance to provide convenient and an
   interface to the user to track the products. The developed system
   results a very low cost system and works dynamically compared with the
   existing present warehouse inventory management systems. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{An inexpensive self-made apparatus for photochemical experiments was
   developed and has been tested to facilitate the inclusion of
   photoreactions in undergraduate teaching laboratories despite budget
   constraints. The core setup allowing the selection of defined
   wavelengths in the visible and UV regions is made of commercially
   available components for less than \$500, including an enclosure
   providing a high safety standard. By choice of the reaction glassware,
   both reactions on micro scale as well as on preparative scale can be
   conducted easily in an appropriate time frame. In the Supporting
   Information, ideas for further optional equipment expanding the setup
   and enhancing its applicability are presented.}},

   measurements}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple 3-D printable open source hardware designs have proven to be
   effective scientific instruments at low costs. Further development in
   this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable
   mechanical components to make fully functional
   distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research
   area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin
   film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs)
   for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission
   properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost
   3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this
   study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample
   holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the
   motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in
   such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable
   latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i)
   unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed
   resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is
   tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a
   spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a
   hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional
   accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash
   error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable
   microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors,
   the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring
   transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open
   source system also represents a 96\% cost in savings as compared to the
   least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are
   offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature
   that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.}},

Title = {{How participative is open source hardware ? Insights from online
   repository mining}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to
   intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source
   Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles
   support the development of products in transparent processes allowing
   the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of
   products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of
   participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains
   unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes
   known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this
   gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the
   transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development
   projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices
   filling a continuum between public and private development settings.
   They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of
   centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the
   expansion of the open source development model from software into the
   realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical
   evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to
   an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the
   scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices,
   techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large
   dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results
   signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding
   stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in
   order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is
   offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers
   many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media
   technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it
   opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source
   system developed for planar chromatography and especially for
   ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a
   thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution
   of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D
   printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for
   full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed
   to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and
   mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of
   dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were
   investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to
   254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range.
   Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999
   were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source
   hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable
   ((sic)810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current
   instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly
   reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean
   laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one
   open-source system were made freely available at
   https://github.com/OfficeChromatography. It is intended to boost
   progress and understanding by the nature of do it yourself.}},

   system is presented by first encoding data, then encrypting it with a
   rotated key before its transmission over the network. The physician
   restores the secure data by using his access credentials and digital

   software was implemented using open source tools and programs and LINUX
   operating system. The system was realized using modular approach. It
   enables easy system expandability, simplifying maintenance and adapting
   of the system to user requirements and needs. Access to system
   monitoring and control is possible using web based user interface and
   command line interface. It is achieved balance between functionality and
   cost of the system. Main advantages of the system compared with standard

Title = {{BRAM-based function reuse for multi-core architectures in FPGAs}},
Journal = {{MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{237-248}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Modern processors contain several specific hardware modules and multiple
   cores to ensure performance for a wide range of applications. In this
   context, FPGAs are frequently used as the implementation platform, since
   they offer architecture customization and fast time-to-market. However,
   many of them may not have the needed resources to implement all the
   necessary features, because of costs or complexity of the system to be
   implemented. When some needed functionalities do not fit in the target,
   they must be mapped into the much slower software domain. In this work,
   we exploit the fact these designs usually underuse their available BRAMs
   and propose a low-cost hardware-based function reuse mechanism for
   FPGAs, recovering some of the performance lost from the software part of
   applications that could not be implemented in hardware logic, with
   minimal impact on LUT usage. This is achieved by saving the inputs and
   outputs of the most frequently executed functions in a BRAM-based reuse
   table, so the next function executions with the same arguments can be
   skipped. This mechanism supports both precise and approximate modes and
   is evaluated with a 4-issue VLIW processor implemented in HDL, also
   considering a multi-core environment. Precise reuse, in single and
   multi-core scenarios, is assessed by running applications that use a
   software library to emulate floating point operations. Approximate reuse
   is evaluated over a single-core image-processing application that
   tolerates a certain level of error. Our scheme achieves 1.39 x geomean
   speedup in the precise single-core, while the multi-core case
   demonstrates application improvements from 1.25 x to 1.9 x when we start
   sharing the reuse table. In the approximate scenario, we achieve 1.52 x
   speedup with less than 10\% error. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The synthesis of three push-pull cationic dyes is reported here together
   with a photophysical study carried out by stationary and ultrafast
   spectroscopies. The hyperpolarizability (beta) values of the three
   molecules have been estimated through a simple solvatochromic method
   based on conventional, low-cost equipment, which had been tested
   previously with success in our laboratory. The investigated pyridinium
   salts showing strong negative solvatochromism bear the same piperidine
   ring as a strong electron-donor group and the same thiophenes as
   electron-rich pi-linkers, but differ in terms of the N-substituent on
   the electron-acceptor pyridinium unit, namely N-methyl in compound A,
   N-pyrimidin-2yl in B and N-2,4-dinitrophenyl in C. The derived beta
   values were found to increase (in the order A<B<C) along with the
   increasing electron-acceptor strength of the pyridinium substituent,
   with the highest polarizability being estimated for the derivative
   bearing the strongest electron-withdrawing substituent dinitrobenzene.
   State-of-the-art femtosecond transient absorption measurements evidenced
   fast kinetics and dynamics in the singlet excited state in agreement
   with charge transfer (CT) processes promoted by excitation, with a
   proper ICT state observed in the case of C. This finding confirms the
   efficiency of photoinduced intramolecular CT as a significant factor
   that affects the NLO response.}},

Abstract = {{Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for monitoring
   cardiac dynamics using electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements. Since
   its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing
   hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based
   on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing
   both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for
   educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a
   platform supporting Do-I t-Yourself project and education applications
   across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open
   hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological
   measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac
   biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933.
   The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC,
   where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as
   heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were
   extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how
   Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely
   available and affordable components, for supporting developers in
   research and engineering education. The design and development documents
   will be available on www.BiosignalPl.com, for open access under a Non

Abstract = {{Most studies of neural correlates of spatial navigation are restricted
   to small arenas (<= 1 m(2)) because of the limits imposed by the
   recording cables. New wireless recording systems have a larger recording
   range. However, these neuronal recording systems lack the ability to
   track animals in large area, constraining the size of the arena. We
   developed and benchmarked an open-source, scalable multicamera tracking
   system based on low-cost hardware. This ``Picamera system{''} was used
   in combination with a wireless recording system for characterizing
   neural correlates of space in environments of sizes up to 16.5 m(2). The
   Picamera system showed substantially better temporal accuracy than a
   popular commercial system. An explicit comparison of one camera from the
   Picamera system with a camera from the commercial system showed improved
   accuracy in estimating spatial firing characteristics and head direction
   tuning of neurons. This improved temporal accuracy is crucial for
   accurately aligning videos from multiple cameras in large spaces and
   characterizing spatially modulated cells in a large environment.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Studies of neural correlates of space are limited to
   biologically unrealistically small spaces by neural recording and
   position tracking hardware. We developed a camera system capable of
   tracking animals in large spaces at a high temporal accuracy. Together
   with the new wireless recording systems, this system facilitates the
   study of neural correlates of space at biologically relevant scale. This
   increased temporal accuracy of tracking also improves the estimates of
   spatiotemporal correlates of neural activity.}},

Abstract = {{Road traffic and its impacts affect various aspects of wellbeing with
   safety, congestion and pollution being of significant concern in cities.
   Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of
   traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the
   collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities.
   Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use
   existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale
   and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This
   paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple
   and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e.,
   bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi
   signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different
   scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e.,
   1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The
   system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets
   not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart
   cities.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a growing consensus that 3D printing technology has emerged as a
   revolutionary driver of innovation in society and has grown
   exponentially as an innovation ecosystem, our understanding of how the
   3D printing ecosystem emerged and has grown is still limited. Based on
   the case study and the grounded theory approach, we found that four
   relevant platforms--open-source hardware platforms, online service
   platforms, free and low-cost 3D design software platforms, and
   crowdsourcing platforms-nurtured the innovation ecosystem. We also found
   that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated
   the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the
   user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of
   entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently,
   we newly suggest ``complementary multiplatforms,{''} a platform strategy
   that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for
   nurturing an innovation ecosystem. Our findings provide important
   theoretical grounds for the multiplatform strategy with complementary
   relationships aimed at facilitating the growth of an innovation

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study the role of temperature in biological systems,
   diagnostic contrasts and thermal therapies, RF pulses for MR spin
   excitation can be deliberately used to apply a thermal stimulus. This
   application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that
   support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating.
   To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on
   positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4)
   stubs.
   Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route
   the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without
   passing through any electronic components (e.g.,
   positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR
   thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz
   (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the
   switch.
   Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB
   during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB
   during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW)
   and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297
   MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive
   with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency
   heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch
   applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally
   activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers
   was demonstrated.
   Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications
   at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in
   biological systems and diseases. All design files of the switch will be
   made available open source at www.opensourceimaging.org.}},

Title = {{OpenHVSR - Processing toolkit: Enhanced HVSR processing of distributed
   microtremor measurements and spatial variation of their informative
   content}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of seismic ambient noise (microtremor) in spectral
   ratio form, known as the Horizontal-to Vertical Spectral Ratio
   technique, is extremely popular nowadays both to investigate large areas
   in a reduced amount of time, and to leverage a wider choice of low cost
   equipment. In general, measurements at multiple locations are collected
   to generate multiple, individual spectral ratio curves. Recently,
   however, there has been an increasing interest in spatially correlating
   informative content from different locations. Accordingly, we introduce
   a new computer program, ``OpenHVSR Processing Toolkit{''}, developed in
   Matlab (R2015b), specifically engineered to enhance data processing with
   the purpose of spatially correlating different forms of informative data
   content, creation of maps, and display of the results in 2D and 3D. The
   interface is designed to be user friendly while tightly binding
   processing and visualization so that the effects of different processing
   choices can be immediately evaluated. Further, bedrock mapping
   capability, as introduced by Ibs-von Seht and Wohlenberg (1999) is
   included both through the computation of bedrock depth via a set of
   published regressions or by computing a customized regression based on
   the data at hand. The program aims at implementing the most effective
   and desirable processing tools present in other commercial and
   non-commercial alternatives, all in one bundle, freely available to the
   scientific community. In addition to incorporating and enhancing
   currently available state of the art tools, we have integrated several
   original features that are not present in any other program. The
   presented processing toolkit naturally integrates with our data
   inversion software, ``OpenHVSR{''}, published in 2016. Together, they
   constitute a complete workflow for the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral
   Ratio method. We expect this first version to be of great use to
   researchers and hope it will constitute the basis for further
   collaborative development toward future releases oriented at exploring
   the potentials of this technique.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how neurons encode and compute information is fundamental
   to our study of the brain, but opportunities for hands-on experience
   with neurophysiological techniques on live neurons are scarce in science
   education. Here, we present Spikeling, an open source in silico
   implementation of a spiking neuron that costs 25 pound and mimics a wide
   range of neuronal behaviours for classroom education and public
   neuroscience outreach. Spikeling is based on an Arduino microcontroller
   running the computationally efficient Izhikevich model of a spiking
   neuron. The microcontroller is connected to input ports that simulate
   synaptic excitation or inhibition, to dials controlling current
   injection and noise levels, to a photodiode that makes Spikeling light
   sensitive, and to a light-emitting diode (LED) and speaker that allows
   spikes to be seen and heard. Output ports provide access to variables
   such as membrane potential for recording in experiments or digital
   signals that can be used to excite other connected Spikelings. These
   features allow for the intuitive exploration of the function of neurons
   and networks mimicking electrophysiological experiments. We also report
   our experience of using Spikeling as a teaching tool for undergraduate
   and graduate neuroscience education in Nigeria and the United Kingdom.}},

Abstract = {{Crane posture estimation is the stepping stone to forest machine
   automation. Here, we introduce a robust minimal perception solution,
   that is, one that uses minimal constraints for maximal benefits.
   Specifically, we introduce a robust particle-filter-based method to
   estimate and track the posture of a flexible hydraulic crane by using
   only low-cost equipment, namely, a two-dimensional (2D) laser scanner,
   two short magnetically attached metal tubes as targets, and an angle
   sensor. An important feature of our method is that it incorporates
   control signals for hydraulic actuators. In contrast to the previous
   works employing laser scanners, we do not use the full shape of the
   crane to estimate the crane posture, but, instead, we use only two small
   targets in the field of view of the laser scanner. Thus, a large share
   of the range data is useful for other purposes, for example, to map the
   surrounding environment. We test the proposed method in a challenging
   forest environment and show that the particle filter is able to estimate
   the posture of the hydraulic crane efficiently and reliably in the
   presence of occlusions and obstructions. During our comprehensive
   testing, the tip position was measured with average errors smaller than
   4.3 cm whereas the absolute maximum error was 15 cm.}},

   these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled
   rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation
   and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced.
   MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results
   were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model
   B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top
   (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed
   and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2
   platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative
   humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are
   useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation
   placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis
   travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source
   showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual
   well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path
   length compensations.}},

Abstract = {{Critical to maintaining quality control in high-throughput screening is
   the need for constant monitoring of liquid-dispensing fidelity.
   Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric
   analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual
   verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening
   platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the
   plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using
   open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser
   accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight
   measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses
   an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local
   network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things
   (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric
   summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are
   detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis.
   All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for
   reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for
   timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system
   also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets,
   mounting solutions, and component enclosures.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging discussion about the sustainability potential of
   distributed production is the starting point for this paper. The focus
   is on the ``design global, manufacture local{''} model. This model
   builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design
   with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from
   three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and
   crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked
   practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a ``design
   global, manufacture local{''} model, as exemplified by these case
   studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy
   from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production.
   ``Design global, manufacture local{''} may be seen as a platform to
   bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical
   infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve
   distributed modes of collaborative production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications
   has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV
   technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to
   UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault
   tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight
   controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight
   controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight
   controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work:
   solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port
   to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using
   open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and
   enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.
   This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone
   platform elements that can be used for research and development. The
   survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone
   platforms and compares their main features.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel algorithm of predictive torque control (PTC)
   for induction motor based on discrete space vector modulation (DSVM).
   DSVM technique increases the number of voltage vectors, which must be
   evaluated in the PTC method. This new technique is called PTC-DSVM,
   which presents a low sampling frequency. However, the high number of
   virtual vectors increases computational burden significantly. To
   overcome this problem, in this paper, a novel algorithm that reduces the
   number of admissible voltage vectors, based on the well-known direct
   torque control switching table, is presented. Both simulation and
   experimental results demonstrate that proposed PTC-DSVM has the same
   behavior as conventional PTC at the same switching frequency while the
   sampling frequency is three times lower. The low sampling frequency of
   the proposed algorithm makes it suitable for industries to use low-cost
   hardware or perform a high computational analysis.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{OMV Austria E\&P GmbH operates approximately 650 artificially lifted oil
   wells with an average water cut (WC) of 96\% in the area of lower
   Austria. The majority of these wells produce with sucker rod pumps (SRP
   76\%), gas lift (GL 16\%) and electrical submersible pumps (ESP 8\%).
   Especially well interventions for equipment replacement due to
   corrosion, associated gas and sand production, represent the main cost
   drivers for operating expenditures for mature fields. Current commodity
   prices are the main driving force behind cost-centric strategies, where
   cost efficient equipment optimization is the key to improve run life.
   The challenge is to extend the run life of the artificial lift system
   without adverse effects on the oil production rates.
   The foundation for any low cost equipment optimization is built on
   detailed in-house failure analysis. Therefore the existing inspection
   procedures of SRPs and GL in the own pump workshop were revised;
   additionally a workflow for ESPs was initiated and implemented. Based on
   the results of these measures the most frequent failure reasons were
   identified and possible mitigations were analysed. The measures include
   design modifications, a stricter quality assurance of new equipment,
   material upgrades and special parts for the respective production
   environment.
   The continuous study has already improved the run life significantly,
   thereby reducing the amount of well interventions and deferred
   production. The new integrated approach of failure analysis, design
   adaptions and quality assurance offered valuable information to prevent
   recurrent systematic equipment failures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a control platform developed to interface with
   various hardware, allowing the design and rapid implementation even of
   advanced controllers, both on academic and industrial systems. The code
   of the controllers is written in the open-source Python language,
   facilitating the translation of code usually written in commercial
   software. The proposed platform can use from Arduinos to Programmable
   Logic Computers (PLCs). Beyond the research and tests on industrial
   facilities, the simplicity of the proposed platform allows its use also
   for educational and training purposes. Therefore, the proposed platform
   can help students focus on system analysis and control theory instead of
   hardware interfacing issues, while using low cost hardware. Developed in
   a client-server scheme, the platform can run in affordable computers
   while taking advantage of high-level mathematical and graphical tools
   available in Python language, allowing rapid implementation of advanced
   controllers. The use of this platform is illustrated with an
   implementation of a model predictive control (MPC) of a level control in
   a laboratory-scale process. A PLC is used to take the level measures, to
   dispatch control signals, and also for interlocking secure tasks. The
   controller runs on a Raspberry Pi computer that communicates with the

Abstract = {{Tracking eye movements is being increasingly recognized as a valuable
   source of information about stimulus control. So far, however,
   eye-tracking research has suffered from accessibility issues, with
   expensive hardware and closed-source software. In this article we review
   Pupil (c), an eye-tracking platform developed by Pupil Labs and that
   combines open-source software with low-cost hardware components. We
   offer concrete recommendations about Pupil use in stimulus-control
   research and we show how the software can be extended to automatize the
   analysis of gaze data. Finally, we present the results of a study of
   visual discrimination and conditioned reinforcement conducted with
   Pupil, establishing the usefulness of this platform as a research tool
   in behavior analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We present the Kilogrid, an open-source virtualization environment and
   data logging manager for the Kilobot robot, Kilobot for short. The
   Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the
   Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and
   to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental
   setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and
   compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system
   composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a
   bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote
   workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software
   architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to
   accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics
   community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a
   200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different
   case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based
   on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging.
   Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the
   experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the
   Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the
   analysis of the experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This repository offers smart-home wearable accelerometer and Radio
   Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data acquired : 1) with low-cost
   hardware; 2) with high-resolution location annotations; 3) from four UK

   relayed to a number of receiving Access Points (AP) placed throughout
   the building. Upon reception of a packet, each AP measures the RSSI of
   the received radio signal and timestamps the accelerometer measurements.
   Location labels are recorded automatically using a small camera which
   registers fiducial floor tags as the participant carries out their
   normal routines in a natural way. Approximately 14 h of annotated
   wearable measurements are provided. A scripted fingerprint measurement
   is provided along with several unscripted natural living recordings,

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{136}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Biodiesel has a potential not completely exploited as substitute of
   diesel oil, despite it is known as biodegradable, nontoxic, and has a
   low-emission profile. The aim of this paper is to propose an ultrasonic
   method as a tool for real-time monitoring transesterification reactions
   by using low-power ultrasound based on a pulse/echo scheme. Two
   catalytic routes were tested, both using degummed soybean oil as source
   and KOH as catalyser. The difference between catalytic routes was the
   type of alcohol used (methanol and ethanol). Three different reaction
   times were studied: 10, 20, and 30 min. Low power (less than 100 mW)
   ultrasonic time-gated bursts were applied to the reactional media at 1
   MHz. The eco was measured during the reaction, and small amounts of the
   reaction media were collected every 2 min for chemical analysis. Time of
   flight and echo waveform amplitude were the ultrasonic parameter of
   interest. The amplitude of the ultrasonic waveform was related with the
   variation of the ethanol-transesterification reaction rate and could
   help in qualitatively monitoring that reaction. Furthermore, density
   measurements where consistent with the variations observed on time of
   flight, confirming the possibility of monitoring the reaction using
   ultrasonic parameters. The behaviour of the ultrasonic parameters varied
   depending on the alcohol and the presence or not of heating during the
   reaction. As a common rule, the stabilization of the ultrasonic
   parameters indicates that the maximum yield for each catalytic route is
   achieved, indicating that the reaction should be stopped for maximum
   energy efficiency. Results disclose that the proposed method is a
   feasible way to monitor the reactions of biodiesel during its
   production, in real time, and with relatively low-cost equipment.
   Further development shall be done to use it in industrial scale, mainly
   regarding the ultrasound power and frequency to be employed. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks, sensor deployment is an important issue in
   which sensors are deployed in a specific monitoring region using
   low-cost hardware but achieving high coverage quality. In recent years,
   several mechanisms have been developed for the efficient robotic
   deployment of sensors. Their performance levels are highly dependent on
   unknown obstacles that can give rise to the dead-end problem. A key
   challenge when developing a robot deployment mechanism is to overcome
   the dead-end problem and deliver full coverage with a minimal number of
   sensors. This paper proposes an impasse-aware robot deployment (IAD)
   algorithm. The proposed IAD mainly consists of basic deployment rules
   and dead-end handling rules. The basic deployment rules are intended to
   achieve full coverage with a minimal number of sensors; the proposed
   dead-end handling rules can efficiently resolve the dead-end problem.
   Extensive experimental studies have demonstrated that our proposed IAD
   achieves superior performance to that of existing robot deployment
   mechanisms with respect to coverage ratio, energy efficiency, deployment
   path length, and required stack space.}},

   Microcontrollers}},

Abstract = {{Microcontrollers are programmable, integrated circuit chips. In the last
   two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and
   household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are
   now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously,
   the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major
   technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and
   sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation
   from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care
   device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen
   potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities
   that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially
   when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the
   Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap
   between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care
   applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of
   microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and
   networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well
   as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to
   share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a
   dreadful chip-in-a-lab-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here
   follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could
   potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip
   research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application
   are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future
   perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Grid, also known as the next generation of the power grid, is
   considered as a power infrastructure with advanced information and
   communication technologies (ICT) that will enhance the efficiency and
   reliability of power systems. For the essential benefits that come with
   Smart Grid, there are also security risks due to the complexity of
   advanced ICT utilized in the architecture of Smart Grid to interconnect
   a huge number of devices and subsystems. Cybersecurity is one of the
   emerging major threats in Smart Grid that needs to be considered as the
   attack surface increased. To prevent cyber-attacks, new techniques and
   methods need to be evaluated in a real-world environment or in a
   testbed. However, the costs for setting-up Smart Grid testbed is
   extensive. In this article, we focused on the development of a Smart
   Grid testbed with a low-cost hardware and software for cybersecurity
   research and education. As a case study, we evaluated the testbed with
   most common cyber-attack such as denial of service attack. In addition,
   the testbed is a useful resource for cybersecurity research and
   education on different aspects of SCADA systems such as protocol
   implementation, and PLC programming.}},

Abstract = {{Advancement of low-cost hardware capable of processing multimedia data
   coupled with efficient short range radio communication has led to the
   development of Wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). We consider
   post-disaster situation analysis application where the nodes in a WMSN
   capture disaster images from the affected area. Energy is one of the
   scarcest resources for such a network especially for disaster
   application where power supply for charging the battery of a node is
   nearly impossible. In this paper we exploit such facts and propose an
   energy saving multimedia (image) data processing scheme for its
   subsequent transmission over energy-constrained WMSN. Unlike
   conventional image processing, it saves energy by reducing the data to
   be transmitted at the cost of segmentation-less adaptive compression.
   Finally, the comparative performance of the scheme shows its dominance
   over all the competing schemes. Precisely, our scheme saves on an
   average 34\% energy over all the competing schemes. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The development of an inexpensive robotic platform is presented. Our aim
   is to provide a complete low-cost hardware tool to illustrate control
   system methods. The capabilities of this platform allow both,
   researchers and students, to implement from basic techniques to complex
   ones (e.g., from model-based control techniques to multiagent dynamical
   systems). The hardware that has been designed and developed performs
   experiments for single or multiple robot control employing capabilities,
   such as locomotion, communication, perception, and autonomous decision
   making. We illustrate different control and system dynamics techniques
   using this platform. After presenting the model and navigation
   strategies, single-agent techniques that ensure safe and predictable
   navigation are shown (PID and fuzzy logic controllers). Then, two
   multiagent techniques are described in order to prove the versatility of
   the platform. The first strategy illustrates common problems that arise
   in nature and power systems (phase synchronization models based on
   pulse-coupled biological oscillators and the Kuramoto oscillator).
   Second, a game theoretical approach for multirobot consensus is shown.
   In all these cases, experimental results show the performance of the
   platform.}},

   a deep-learning technique. Inspired by the fact that humans can learn
   sign language from just a set of pictures in a book, in the proposed
   method, the input data are pre-processed into an image. In addition, the
   network is partially pre-trained to imitate the preliminarily obtained
   knowledge of humans. The learning process is implemented with a
   well-known network, that is, a convolutional neural network. Twelve sign
   actions are learned in 10 situations, and can be recognized with an
   accuracy of 99\% in scenarios with low-cost equipment and limited data.
   The results show that the system is highly practical, as well as

   different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at
   different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer

Abstract = {{Background. A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment
   based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The
   system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial
   intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with
   Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated
   by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer
   vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points
   and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the
   laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained
   to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task,
   whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a
   preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery,
   from hospital Raymundo Abarca Alarcon, constituted the experienced class
   for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents)
   without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal
   invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autonoma de
   Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants
   performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to
   build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning
   curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The
   classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic
   curve of 90.98\% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to
   evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or
   nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable
   laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality,
   and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the
   potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied
   to programs with limited resources.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a complete on-line condition monitoring system (CMS)
   designed to detect incipient broken rotor bar (BRB) fault in double-cage
   induction motor (DCIM) using the stator current signature. The novelty
   of this paper lies in the successful combination of one of the latest
   variants of wavelet techniques, the recursive stationary wavelet packet
   transform and the widely used tool in quality control, the statistical
   process control (SPC) in order to deal with several challenges in the
   continuous monitoring of incipient BRB fault. In fact, breakage in outer
   bars (OBs) of a DCIM is known to be less prone to exhibit fault
   signature in the stator current than that of a single-cage IM,
   especially during the steady motor operation mode. Furthermore, on-line
   CMSs should at the same time act at normal motor operating mode,
   including steady and transient modes and be reconfigurable with no motor
   size dependence. The complete on-line CMS was designed and implemented
   in a low-cost hardware environment and was validated with 3-kW DCIM
   featuring incipient OB faults. A 100\% fault detection accuracy starting
   from 3-mm OB breakage during normal motor operating mode, with the
   autolearning fault threshold, demonstrates the reliability and
   flexibility of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of an instrumented bicycle and its
   computational model for teaching multibody dynamics. The presented
   approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic
   simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized
   coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental
   phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary
   sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on
   these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in
   different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In
   addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact
   forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated
   velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an
   inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper
   describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling
   readers to build the very same system for their own educational use. The
   instrumented bicycle system is based on open-source software and as much

Abstract = {{This paper presents three lifting structures of Daubechies-8 (also known
   as D8) wavelet transform using efficient factorization of the polyphase
   matrix. All new filter coefficients are optimally mapped with integers
   resulting in low cost hardware implementation. We first derive the
   polyphase matrices using a factorization algorithm, which forms the
   basis of multiple lifting structures of D8. A theoretical framework is
   then derived and proven experimentally to eliminate the scaling stage of
   the algorithm that incurs computation error in conventional
   integer-based wavelets. This elimination of the scaling stage makes the
   proposed architecture lossless. Also due to the optimum integer mapping,
   the 8-bit implementation of our schemes produces very similar results
   than that of the classical double-precision D8 filter. Finally, we
   compare our results with other existing lifting wavelets to demonstrate
   the advantage in terms of lower cost, losslessness and improved
   performance.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate a potentiostat built with a single
   commercially available integrated circuit (IC) that does not require any
   external electronic components to perform electrochemical experiments.
   This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip
   (PSoC (R)) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the
   necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent
   papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or
   specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having
   to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components.
   To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in
   the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style
   that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice
   for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and
   based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical
   techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming
   skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The
   potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source
   laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide
   range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure
   vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure
   glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to
   measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments
   and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.}},

Abstract = {{During pesticide application, operators are exposed to chemical
   products. Dermal exposure has been reported as the principal means of
   exposure for growers. In the present work, potential dermal exposure
   (PDE) has been assessed when using new low-cost equipment (a knapsack
   with a vertical spray boom) and compared to a hand-held spray lance,
   which is the equipment most widely used by growers in greenhouses. Two
   sprayers were used, a hand-held spray lance with four twin flat-fan
   nozzles and a knapsack fitted out with a vertical spray boom containing
   3 pairs of twin flat-fan nozzles. Three applications were carried out
   and compared, one with the spray lance walking backwards (the reference
   application), and two with the spray boom- the first stopping at the
   turns and the second with no stopping. The patch method (19 position on
   the body) and tartrazine (the tracer) were used to assess de PDE. Each
   application tested was replicated three times. The results show that the
   knapsack with the vertical boom should not be used walking continuously
   along the greenhouse rows because the total PDE (1637.12 mL 1000 L-1) is
   greater than in the rest of the configurations tested. If the operator
   stops at the turns for a few seconds, allowing the previously sprayed
   droplet cloud to dissipate, the level of exposure decreases
   significantly (324.63 mL 1000 L-1), providing similar results to the
   reference application with the spray lance walking backwards (292.25 mL
   1000 L-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A telescope control system relies on a pointing model to determine the
   gimbal angles that aim the telescope toward a desired target.
   High-accuracy telescope pointing models include parameters that describe
   the mount/telescope orientation as well as common mechanical effects.
   For professional telescopes, calibrating the pointing model requires
   careful initial alignment around a nominal orientation (e.g., leveling)
   followed by sightings of dozens to hundreds of stars to fit the model
   parameters. While this approach is effective for observatories,
   applications such as transportable optical ground stations for
   communications, space situational awareness, or astronomy using low-cost
   telescope networks can benefit from a more rapid calibration approach.
   We formulate a quaternion-based pointing model that utilizes
   measurements from an externally mounted star camera to compromise
   between calibration speed and accuracy. A key aspect of this formulation
   is that it is completely agnostic to the orientation of the
   telescope/mount so that no manual prealignment is required. We derive
   angle and rate commands for telescope pointing and tracking based on the
   model. We present results from a 15-min calibration procedure on a very
   low-cost telescope that demonstrated pointing to an accuracy of 53 arc
   sec RMS in azimuth and 66 arc sec RMS between 20-deg and 70-deg
   altitude. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Abstract = {{We present a practical, robust, and effective pipeline to compute a
   high-resolution (HR) image of the corneal endothelium starting from a
   low-resolution (LR) video sequence obtained with a general purpose slit

   expensive confocal microscopes is achieved via software magnification by
   exploiting information redundancy in the video sequence. In particular,
   the HR image is generated from the best LR frames, obtained by
   identifying the most suitable endothelium video subsequence using a
   support vector machine-based learning approach, followed by a robust
   graph-based frame registration. Results on long, real sequences show
   that the proposed approach is fast and produces better quality images
   than both classical multiframe super-resolution approaches and
   commercial state-of-the-art mosaicing software. Only low-cost equipment
   is required that makes the proposed method a valid diagnostic tool and

Abstract = {{Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging and evolving
   rapidly thanks to widespread open-source hardware platforms. Most of the
   high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as
   the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width
   modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers,
   and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such
   as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring
   peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure
   the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse
   open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming
   those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we
   propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the
   operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software
   framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the
   real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the
   feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy.}},

Title = {{Shaping Streamflow Using a Real-Time Stormwater Control Network}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{``Smart{''} water systems are transforming the field of stormwater
   management by enabling real-time monitoring and control of previously
   static infrastructure. While the localized benefits of active control
   are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of
   watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart
   stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban
   watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two
   internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control
   objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and
   generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we
   describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost,
   open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling
   application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by
   determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various
   waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this
   characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired
   responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a
   set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately
   constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved
   waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how
   these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby
   mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into
   downstream waterbodies.}},

Title = {{An Upper Extremity Rehabilitation System Using Efficient Vision-Based
   Action Identification Techniques}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes an action identification system for home upper
   extremity rehabilitation. In the proposed system, we apply an RGB-depth
   (color-depth) sensor to capture the image sequences of the patient's
   upper extremity actions to identify its movements. We apply a skin color
   detection technique to assist with extremity identification and to build
   up the upper extremity skeleton points. We use the dynamic time warping
   algorithm to determine the rehabilitation actions. The system presented
   herein builds up upper extremity skeleton points rapidly. Through the
   upper extremity of the human skeleton and human skin color information,
   the upper extremity skeleton points are effectively established by the
   proposed system, and the rehabilitation actions of patients are
   identified by a dynamic time warping algorithm. Thus, the proposed
   system can achieve a high recognition rate of 98\% for the defined
   rehabilitation actions for the various muscles. Moreover, the
   computational speed of the proposed system can reach 125 frames per
   second-the processing time per frame is less than 8 ms on a personal
   computer platform. This computational efficiency allows efficient
   extensibility for future developments to deal with complex ambient
   environments and for implementation in embedded and pervasive systems.
   The major contributions of the study are: (1) the proposed system is not
   only a physical exercise game, but also a movement training program for
   specific muscle groups; (2) The hardware of upper extremity
   rehabilitation system included a personal computer with personal
   computer and a depth camera. These are economic equipment, so that
   patients who need this system can set up one set at home; (3) patients
   can perform rehabilitation actions in sitting position to prevent
   him/her from falling down during training; (4) the accuracy rate of
   identifying rehabilitation action is as high as 98\%, which is
   sufficient for distinguishing between correct and wrong action when
   performing specific action trainings; (5) The proposed upper extremity
   rehabilitation system is real-time, efficient to vision-based action
   identification, and low-cost hardware and software, which is affordable
   for most families.}},

Title = {{Creation and Detection of Hardware Trojans Using Non-Invasive
   Off-The-Shelf Technologies}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{As a result of the globalisation of the semiconductor design and
   fabrication processes, integrated circuits are becoming increasingly
   vulnerable to malicious attacks. The most concerning threats are
   hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or
   alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the
   possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the
   complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the
   majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all
   require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans.
   Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited
   hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in
   technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however,
   these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs
   during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is
   created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect
   the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf
   technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power
   Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements.
   Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and
   benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to
   accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using
   off-the-shelf hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many
   respects. However, their computational demands are also growing, which
   constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological
   vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates
   limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts
   of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different
   locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than
   biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly
   relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To
   facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have
   developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid
   saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files
   under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras,
   large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in
   focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same
   as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in
   grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are
   the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline,
   range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate
   systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are
   speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal
   platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of
   primate vision systems.}},

Title = {{Comparison of flow pressures in different 3-way infusion devices: an
   in-vitro study}},
Journal = {{PATIENT SAFETY IN SURGERY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of multiple infusions through one cannula is an
   increasingly common practice in anaesthesia. High pressures in the line
   often lead to occlusion alarms and pump disconnection. In this study, we
   aim to determine the pressures generated in common 3-way infusion
   devices, using simple low-cost equipment available and currently in use
   in the operating theatre environment.
   Methods: We compared three different common and commercially available
   3-way infusion devices that allowed multiple infusions through one
   cannula in vitro. One with anti-siphon valves, one without valves, and
   serial extension sets with side ports connected in series. An invasive
   blood pressure transducer was used to monitor line pressure. Seven
   different infusion rates were used to simulate different infusions.
   Results: 3-way infusion devices with anti-siphon valves have 5.5 times
   the infusion pressures compared to devices without valves (P < 0.001).
   The highest pressures obtained across all devices were at the highest
   flow rate studied (400 ml/hr); this was 243 mmHg in the 3-way device
   with anti-siphon valves, compared to only 44 mmHg in the 3-way device
   without valves and 36 mmHg in the serial extension sets. Serial
   extension sets have the lowest pressures across all flow rates when
   compared to 3-way devices without valves. (P = 0.0001).
   Conclusions: The presence of anti-siphon valves generate very high
   pressures in infusion lines that can contribute to occlusion alarm
   disconnection of a pump. However, when measured alone and in-vitro,
   these pressures are not sufficient to trigger occlusion alarms. There
   are 3-way infusion devices without anti-siphon valves that have lower
   line pressures, but clinicians should be aware of negative pressure
   scenarios which can lead to siphoning when using them.}},

Abstract = {{We designed, produced and characterized new capacitive strain sensors
   based on colloidal gold nanoparticles. The active area of these sensors,
   made up of a 1 mm(2) close-packed assembly of gold nanoparticles between
   interdigitated electrodes, was designed to achieve measurable
   capacitance (>similar to 1 pF) and overcome parasitic capacitances.
   Electro-mechanical experiments revealed that the sensitivity of such
   capacitive sensors increases in relation to the size of the
   nanoparticles. In the case of 14 nm gold NPs, such sensors present a
   relative capacitance variation of -5.2\% for a strain of 1.5\%, which is
   more than 5 times higher than that observed for conventional capacitive
   strain gauges. The existence of two domains (pure capacitive domain and
   mixed capacitive-resistance domain) as a function of the frequency
   measurement allows for the adaptation of sensitivity of these capacitive
   sensors. A simple low-cost circuit based on a microcontroller board was
   finally developed to detect the capacitance variations of such NP based
   strain sensors. This low-cost equipment paves the way for the
   development of an entirely wireless application set-up.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source
   technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in
   the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and
   Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality
   monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in
   common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring
   data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open
   source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data
   sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on
   developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through
   material engagement with technology and issues of concern.
   Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing
   engagement with the problem of participation in its technological,
   social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing
   centralization and specialization of scientific and technological
   expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab's
   approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of
   citizen/civic veillance, or ``sousveillance{''}, by emphasizing people
   before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that
   this shift in perspective might provide.}},

Title = {{Design of Low-Cost Vehicle Roll Angle Estimator Based on Kalman Filters
   and an IoT Architecture}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there have been many advances in vehicle technologies
   based on the efficient use of real-time data provided by embedded
   sensors. Some of these technologies can help you avoid or reduce the
   severity of a crash such as the Roll Stability Control (RSC) systems for
   commercial vehicles. In RSC, several critical variables to consider such
   as sideslip or roll angle can only be directly measured using expensive
   equipment. These kind of devices would increase the price of commercial
   vehicles. Nevertheless, sideslip or roll angle or values can be
   estimated using MEMS sensors in combination with data fusion algorithms.
   The objectives stated for this research work consist of integrating roll
   angle estimators based on Linear and Unscented Kalman filters to
   evaluate the precision of the results obtained and determining the
   fulfillment of the hard real-time processing constraints to embed this
   kind of estimators in IoT architectures based on low-cost equipment able
   to be deployed in commercial vehicles. An experimental testbed composed
   of a van with two sets of low-cost kits was set up, the first one
   including a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, and the other having an Intel Edison
   System on Chip. This experimental environment was tested under different
   conditions for comparison. The results obtained from low-cost
   experimental kits, based on IoT architectures and including estimators
   based on Kalman filters, provide accurate roll angle estimation. Also,
   these results show that the processing time to get the data and execute
   the estimations based on Kalman Filters fulfill hard real time
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) has opened productive ways to cultivate
   soil with the use of low-cost hardware (sensors/actuators) and
   communication (Internet) technologies. Remote equipment and crop
   monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart
   logistics and warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities.
   Nevertheless, farmers are agriculture experts but, usually, do not have
   experience in IoT applications. Users who use IoT applications must
   participate in its design, improving the integration and use. In this
   work, different industrial agricultural facilities are analysed with
   farmers and growers to design new functionalities based on IoT paradigms
   deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain knowledge and
   experience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural
   applications. Internet of things paradigms are used as resources to
   facilitate the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules and
   smart processes are implemented using a distributed model based on edge
   and fog computing paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed
   using these technologies. The aim is to help farmers to develop smart
   systems both, in current and new facilities. Different decision trees to
   automate the installation, designed by the farmer, can be easily
   deployed using the method proposed in this document.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As the expectation for higher quality of life increases, consumers have
   higher demands for quality food. Food authentication is the technical
   means of ensuring food is what it says it is. A popular approach to food
   authentication is based on spectroscopy, which has been widely used for
   identifying and quantifying the chemical components of an object. This
   approach is non-destructive and effective but expensive. This paper
   presents a computer vision-based sensor system for food authentication,
   i.e., differentiating organic from non-organic apples. This sensor
   system consists of low-cost hardware and pattern recognition software.
   We use a flashlight to illuminate apples and capture their images
   through a diffraction grating. These diffraction images are then
   converted into a data matrix for classification by pattern recognition
   algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine
   (SVM) and three partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-
   based methods. We carry out experiments on a reasonable collection of
   apple samples and employ a proper pre-processing, resulting in a highest
   classification accuracy of 94\%. Our studies conclude that this sensor
   system has the potential to provide a viable solution to empower
   consumers in food authentication.}},

Abstract = {{Tungsten inert gas (TIG) is a wide common process used in fabrication
   due to its low cost equipment, high quality and accuracy welds but has
   low productivity related to the low penetration depth in single pass. A
   new perspective, the Activated Tungsten Inert Gas (ATIG), in which the
   same equipment as TIG is used, except that a thin layer of activated
   flux is deposited on a workpiece surface. In this work, eight kinds of
   oxides were tested on 316L austenitic stainless steel. Three levels of
   welding current were used to study the effect of different activating
   fluxes on weld bead geometry and mechanical properties. X-ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used for the first and the second
   level energy for different ATIG welds to analyze the relationship
   between the weld shape and oxygen content in welds. The experimental
   results showed that the weld profile is related to the thermodynamic
   stability of selected oxides and in relation to the energy provided.
   ATIG with TiO2, SiO2, MnO2 oxides presented the deepest welds followed
   by Cr2O3, Fe2O3, and ZnO. Finally ZrO2, CaO oxides had no effect on the
   weld depth. The ATIG welded joint showed better tensile strength than
   TIG. The ATIG hardness measurements carried out showed also better if
   not the same as TIG weld except for the Silicon oxide weld. Results of
   the impact test showed that, except for the titanium dioxide TiO2 which
   has a good benefit, the weldment using the other oxide fluxes exhibits
   worse withstanding to sudden shock than TIG welding.}},

   kinematics and dynamics, using the equations deducted from the
   calculation for the movement, by modifying travel distance, angle of
   inclination and mass of the objects. The measurement of the time will be
   used to obtain the uncertainty in the experiments, the dispersion of the
   available data is related to the size of the sample and the procedure
   used. In the indirect measurements were used equations due to the
   correlation in the physical variables for the analysis of uncertainty.
   One of the methods for uncertainty analysis is based on the statistical
   analysis, another way to estimate this is through experience or external
   information available. The experiments made in the inclined plane for
   the study of the velocity, acceleration and force of friction to angles
   greater than 15 degrees, showed a relative error of 1.8\% in the time
   variable, the standard uncertainty had a normal distribution with a
   confidence level of 95\%.}},

Abstract = {{To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case
   differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to
   control them in the same way even if the robots come from different
   manuf acturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the
   same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently,
   if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are
   the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the
   manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors).
   The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial
   protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in
   account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.
   This paper describes the design and the results of using a standard
   interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a
   centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot.
   On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared,
   ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to
   control them.
   Extension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot 2) is proposed
   to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to
   continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use
   data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus
   on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted to
   other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has been released by 3GPP to
   provide extended coverage and low energy consumption for low-cost
   machine-type devices. Requiring only a reasonably low-cost hardware
   update to the already deployed long term evolution base stations and
   being compatible with current core network and enhanced core solutions
   that aim to reduce the battery consumption and minimize the signaling,
   NB-IoT deployments are quickly increasing, making NB-IoT a dominating
   technology for low-power wide area networks. To this aim, in this paper,
   we focus on group communications (i.e., multicast) in NB-IoT to
   efficiently support the transmission of firmware, software, task
   updates, or commands toward a large set of devices. We discuss the
   architectural and procedural enhancements needed to support the unique
   features of group communications in machine-type environments, such as
   customer-driven group formation. We also extend the NB-IoT frame to
   include a channel for multicast transmissions. Finally, we propose two
   transmission strategies for multicast content delivery and evaluate
   their performance considering the impact on the downlink background
   traffic and the channel occupancy.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with
   limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to
   access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields
   of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment
   such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands
   of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale
   testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for
   meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of
   microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive.
   Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of
   costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and
   additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs
   of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific
   research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a
   micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible
   computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer
   and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first
   demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured
   components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile
   tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of
   Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester
   was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to
   provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film
   buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in
   conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in
   surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain.
   No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to
   prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with
   the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis
   we term `superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation
   of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested
   represents cost savings of > 99\% compared to commercial solutions in
   its class and offers simple customization. However, continued
   development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach
   the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Scaling up robot swarms to collectives of hundreds or even thousands
   without sacrificing sensing, processing, and locomotion capabilities is
   a challenging problem. Low-cost robots are potentially scalable, but the
   majority of existing systems have limited capabilities, and these
   limitations substantially constrain the type of experiments that could
   be performed by robotics researchers. Instead of adding functionality by
   adding more components and therefore increasing the cost, we demonstrate
   how low-cost hardware can be used beyond its standard functionality. We
   systematically review 15 swarm robotic systems and analyse their sensing
   capabilities by applying a general sensor model from the sensing and
   measurement community. This work is based on the HoverBot system. A
   HoverBot is a levitating circuit board that manoeuvres by pulling itself
   towards magnetic anchors that are embedded into the robot arena. We show
   that HoverBot's magnetic field readouts from its Hall-effect sensor can
   be associated to successful movement, robot rotation and collision
   measurands. We build a time series classifier based on these magnetic
   field readouts. We modify and apply signal processing techniques to
   enable the online classification of the time-variant magnetic field
   measurements on HoverBot's low-cost microcontroller. We enabled HoverBot
   with successful movement, rotation, and collision sensing capabilities
   by utilising its single Hall-effect sensor. We discuss how our
   classification method could be applied to other sensors to increase a
   robot's functionality while retaining its cost.}},

Abstract = {{Ground displacement monitoring is one of the most important aspects of
   early warning systems and risk management strategies when addressing
   phenomena such as landslides or subsidence. Several types of
   instrumentation already exist, but those able to provide real-time
   warnings on multiple time series are typically based on expensive
   technology, highlighting the need to develop a low-cost, easy to install
   system suitable for emergency monitoring. Therefore, a wireless network
   based on ultra-wideband impulse radiofrequency technology has been
   realized. The novelty of this network consists of its ability to measure
   the distance between nodes using the same signals used for transmission
   without the need for an actual measurement sensor. The system was tested
   by monitoring a mudflow in Central Italy and revealed its suitability as
   an early warning tool. More research on the integration of future
   low-cost hardware and eventual industrialization would provide further
   improvement to this promising technology.}},

Abstract = {{Control theory education, when supported by practice, becomes more
   comprehendible for students and useful for their professional career.
   This paper presents low-cost experiments for laboratory sessions of a
   feedback control systems course, which introduces them modeling feedback
   control systems, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller
   design, root locus and Bode plots. The experiments are organized around
   the Arduino-based identification and control of a DC motor via
   Matlab/Simulink. The objective of this laboratory session is to support
   teaching feedback control systems via experimental investigations on a
   low-cost laboratory kit. The built in-house setups support
   Arduino-Simulink interface, so that students can download their control
   diagrams in Simulink to the Arduino board directly. This interface
   allows students to utilize high level control design tools, such as
   Matlab/Simulink while working on a low-cost hardware laboratory setup.
   Students' performance in the written exams before and after the
   laboratory setup were reported to evaluate the instructional
   effectiveness. Besides, student feedback for four semesters are also
   presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Fog computing is gaining attention due to the potential of aggregating
   and processing time-sensitive data at the nearby intelligent gateways.
   It reduces the latency of sensors data aggregation and response time
   therefore, improve real-time action which is beneficial in environmental
   monitoring and early warning systems. However, deploying edge computing
   in Internet-less environment seems unpractical and the mobility of
   gateways is less focused in current literature. In this paper, we
   present a practical design of a portable gateways scheme for sensors
   data aggregation and processing in Internet-less environment. The
   proposed gateways can locate their geographical locations which can be
   automatically converted into location names at the central gateway. The
   proposed portable Fog Gateways are developed by using open-source
   hardware and integrated with Cloud database for data storage. Data
   processing techniques such as data parsing and Reverse Geocoding are
   conducted for reliable data transmission by using GSM/GPRS technology
   and geographical location name detection respectively. Finally, a case
   study has been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of our proposed Fog

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},

Abstract = {{1. The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife
   monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of
   many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology,
   open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to
   more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage
   for conservation researchers and managers.
   2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost,
   small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ``AudioMoth.{''} The
   device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for
   recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384
   kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of
   large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of
   natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth
   to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by
   individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices
   flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems.
   3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of
   AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification
   algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to
   trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana)
   demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial
   and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An
   algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun
   blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1
   km with continuous recording.
   4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive
   acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability
   and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of
   similar to US\$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied
   applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing
   developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing
   component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities
   being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based devices are continuing to grow rapidly. However,
   conventional paper patterning methods are mostly restricted to the
   fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) patterns. Here, we present a novel
   patterning method for the fabrication of 2D and 3D paper-based devices.
   For the first time, a 3D fluidic channel network with multiple crossings
   of fluidic channels is successfully fabricated on a layer of paper
   without sophisticated procedures. The proposed method utilizes a
   commercially available inkjet printer to print water pattern as a
   protective mask onto both sides of a paper substrate and followed by
   soaking the sample into a non-polar solution which contains a
   hydrophobic substance to form hydrophobic barriers on the paper
   substrate. The printed water mask helps preventing the adsorption of the
   non-polar solution into the printed water area resulting in the
   formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas. This opens up a new
   route towards the development of 2D and 3D paper-based devices using
   low-cost equipment and a variety of materials.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific communities are drawn to the open source model as an
   increasingly utilitarian method to produce and share work. Initially
   used as a means to develop freely-available software, open source
   projects have been applied to hardware including scientific tools.
   Increasing convenience of 3D printing has fueled the proliferation of
   open labware projects aiming to develop and share designs for scientific
   tools that can be produced in-house as inexpensive alternatives to
   commercial products. We present our design of a micropipette that is
   assembled from 3D-printable parts and some hardware that works by
   actuating a disposable syringe to a user-adjustable limit. Graduations
   on the syringe are used to accurately adjust the set point to the
   desired volume. Our open design printed micropipette is assessed in
   comparison with a commercial pipette and meets the ISO 8655 standards.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Applications involving data acquisition from sensors need samples at a
   preset frequency rate, the filtering out of noise and/or analysis of
   certain frequency components. We propose a novel software architecture
   based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to
   create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and
   frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes
   given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of
   clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In
   addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to
   implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling
   rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it
   feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis,
   operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2
   out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal
   processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5.
   Participants showed their intention of using this software because it
   was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the
   library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small
   biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even
   in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The
   general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and
   intuitive.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a bio-inspired visual motion estimation algorithm
   based on motion energy, along with its compact very-large-scale
   integration (VLSI) architecture using low-cost embedded systems. The
   algorithm mimics motion perception functions of retina, V1, and MT
   neurons in a primate visual system. It involves operations of ternary
   edge extraction, spatiotemporal filtering, motion energy extraction, and
   velocity integration. Moreover, we propose the concept of confidence map
   to indicate the reliability of estimation results on each probing
   location. Our algorithm involves only additions and multiplications
   during runtime, which is suitable for low-cost hardware implementation.
   The proposed VLSI architecture employs multiple (frame, pixel, and
   operation) levels of pipeline and massively parallel processing arrays
   to boost the system performance. The array unit circuits are optimized
   to minimize hardware resource consumption. We have prototyped the
   proposed architecture on a low-cost field-programmable gate array
   platform (Zynq 7020) running at 53-MHz clock frequency. It achieved
   30-frame/s real-time performance for velocity estimation on 160 x 120
   probing locations. A comprehensive evaluation experiment showed that the
   estimated velocity by our prototype has relatively small errors (average
   endpoint error < 0.5 pixel and angular error < 10 degrees) for most
   motion cases.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Since the advent of modern computer-aided design software, engineers
   have been divorced from the highly collaborative environment previously
   enjoyed. Today's highly complex designs require modern software tools
   and the realities of a global economy often constrain engineers to
   remote collaboration. These conditions make it highly impractical to
   collaborate locally around physical models. Various approaches to
   creating new collaboration tools and software, which alleviate these
   issues, have been tried previously. However, past solutions either used
   expensive hardware, which is not widely available, or used standard
   two-dimensional (2D) monitors to share three-dimensional (3D)
   information. Recently, new low-cost virtual reality (VR) hardware has
   been introduced, which creates a highly immersive 3D experience at a
   tiny fraction of the cost of previous hardware. This work demonstrates
   an immersive collaborative environment built using a network of this
   hardware, which allows users to interact with gestures virtually and
   conducts a study to show its advantages over traditional video
   conferencing software.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed electric fields (PEF) technology is an innovative food processing
   system and it has been introduced in relatively recent times as a
   pre-treatment of liquid and semi-solid food. Low cost-equipment and
   short processing time, coupled to the effectiveness in assisting the

   challenging solution for the industrial red winemaking; a tailored
   PEF-assisted maceration was demonstrated to promote an increase in wine
   color quality and an improvement in the polyphenolic profile. Despite
   the application of PEF has been studied and the positive effects in
   selected wine varieties were demonstrated on batch and pilot-scale
   systems, there is a need for a more detailed characterization of the
   impact in different grapes, and for a better understanding of potential

Abstract = {{Thermal Pyranometers are very important devices for evaluating the
   intensity of solar radiation under different climatic conditions. These
   devices utilize thermal radiation for comparison and determination of
   their efficiency. Because of this wide use associated with the
   development of new technologies, a simple and low-cost version of
   thermal pyranometer has been studied, designed and manufactured. A
   blackened aluminum disk is used as a hot junction, and the cold junction
   is exposed to ambient air. The two terminals are connected to a digital
   amplifier with output signal directed to an Arduino board. A device
   calibration was performed by comparing the results with a commercial
   photodiode sensor. Statistical analysis of the calibration data
   considering a 99\% confidence level leads to an estimated standard error
   of 20.8 W/m(2). An analysis of its response time also estimated from a
   dynamic model. This model uses a numerical solution of the energy
   balance on heat exchange between the aluminum disc and the environment.
   The instrument response time based on the average of the estimates
   obtained from the dynamic model is about 1.5 minutes. Based on these
   studies it was concluded that the characteristics of the sensor are
   adequate for most solar energy tests and the final cost of US \$ 60.00
   is much lower than the large majority of such commercial devices.}},

Abstract = {{Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low
   operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing
   thin and uniform films rapidly, while minimizing material waste. The
   complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive
   machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to
   overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach,
   which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and
   then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials
   are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used
   to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated
   into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive
   manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full
   design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source
   license including software and operational protocols. This study
   demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed
   using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2
   found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum
   optical transmission of 99.1\%, which shows this additive manufacturing
   approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of
   producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this
   method, a cost savings of over 17,000\% was obtained when compared to
   commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Intelligent Video Surveillance Platform for Wireless Multimedia Sensor
   Networks}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) are increasingly being
   deployed for surveillance and monitoring applications. WMSNs
   applications produce large amount of data, which require high
   transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia
   services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an
   intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia
   sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for
   joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained
   embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion
   indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and
   handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is
   developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can
   adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different
   retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets
   can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to
   avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware
   platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is
   extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the
   results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance
   application and show that it works well in long-term deployments.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are used in many areas,
   such as intelligent transportation, smart city, hospital, games,
   education. Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio
   frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the
   students' answer to teachers' managerment system, where there exists
   high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to
   improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic
   in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
   is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of
   universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students'
   identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported
   RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms,
   such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used
   to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students'
   behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another
   technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly
   access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the
   classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen
   the motivation of students' learning. This IoT system can improve the
   attendance of students, and give a positive impact on students' learning
   process for higher education.}},

Abstract = {{It is often difficult for students grasp the concept that some organisms
   can grow in the absence of oxygen and that oxygen can be toxic to
   organisms. However, as educators usually describe in the classroom, the
   importance of the anaerobic growth of microorganisms can be seen in many
   areas of industry, health, and the creation of several categories of
   food ranging from fermented alcohols to breads and cheeses. To
   demonstrate that microorganisms can grow and thrive in the absence of
   oxygen, we have developed an inexpensive and easy technique to culture
   facultative anaerobic bacteria from yogurt in high school or
   undergraduate biology laboratories. Using the method discussed, which
   uses readily available and low-cost equipment, students can culture and
   visually identify facultative anaerobic bacteria that they may consume
   on a regular basis, demonstrating the utility of organisms that thrive
   in an anaerobic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Addressing the navigation (localization and motion control) problem of a
   mobile robot, coupled with its mapping problem, remains a significant
   challenge to date. The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping
   problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout
   specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks.
   Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot
   motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on
   sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or
   3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer
   simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping
   problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only
   measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used
   in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and
   easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing
   motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to
   estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating
   environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources.
   It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional
   points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with
   a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and
   mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its
   performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a
   commercial robot simulator.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the design and development of a low cost building
   environmental monitoring system, and it is based on Open Source
   Platforms and on the Internet of Things. To achieve this aim, a wireless
   micro-controller with attached sensors has been used to collect the
   environmental data. The information obtained from the sensors is
   collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent
   via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet,
   which permits us to access the information in real time.
   On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from
   sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance
   guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate
   environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation
   of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy
   performance and providing information related to the data storage and
   its cost of development.
   The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems
   for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple
   applications of Smart Environments. The development of projects through
   these platforms will allow future research to tackle the existing
   barriers in monitoring campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid manufacturing using 3-D printing is a potential solution to some
   of the most pressing issues for humanitarian logistics. In this paper,
   findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new
   type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed
   specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of
   humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with
   design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused
   filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper
   design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6)
   on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control
   mechanisms. The technology is then disclosed with an open source license
   for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer. A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are
   evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health
   facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas
   throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability
   to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of
   use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are
   presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the
   Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a
   humanitarian context.}},

Title = {{A Low-Cost Hardware Design of a 1-D SPIHT Algorithm for Video Display

Abstract = {{This paper presents low-cost compressors for video display systems,
   which compress video data to reduce the size of the frame memory in a
   display panel in a television or a smartphone. The hardware solution
   exploits the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and 1-D set partitioning
   in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) to support the raster-scan processing
   order in a display system and meet the fixed target compression ratio
   (CR). However, the compression efficiency and hardware cost often
   increase in proportion to the block size and thus, designing a
   compressor with low cost but high fidelity is challenging. This paper
   proposes a generic partitioned SPIHT algorithm, which achieves a
   low-cost design for mobile devices by allowing various sizes of
   partitioned sub-blocks. By taking advantage of DWT decomposition
   properties, the proposed algorithm partitions a coding block into
   sub-blocks, each of which can be processed independently. The
   independent coding operations among multiple sub-blocks allow the size
   of the hardware buffer to be decreased, by storing the temporary results
   only for an individual sub-block. However, the proposed sub-block coding
   slightly decreases the compression efficiency when each sub-block is
   compressed with the same target CR. To reduce the drop-off in the
   compression efficiency, the boundary-pixel handling in DWT is exploited
   and the proposed partitioned SPIHT method adjusts the target CR for each
   sub-block depending on the potential quality loss. When compared with
   the previous 1-D design, experimental results show that the hardware
   gate count and internal memory are reduced by 59.34\% and 75\%,
   respectively. Furthermore, the proposed boundary handling and
   bit-allocation schemes mitigate the PSNR degradation due to the
   sub-block coding by 1.11 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Major cloud service providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have
   started employing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to build
   high-performance and low-power-consumption cloud capability. However,
   utilizing an FPGA-enabled cloud is still challenging because of two main
   reasons. First, the introduction of software and hardware co-design
   leads to high development complexity. Second, FPGA virtualization and
   accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster
   deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service
   (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and
   deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform
   implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator
   repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects.
   Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are
   proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With
   the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be
   organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.}},

   Test were between.301-,.598 and between.304-,.506, respectively. In
   addition, KR20 coefficient was found as 0.844. Before application of the
   ``Power Electronics Course Achievement Test{''}, there was not a
   significant difference in total scores of both daytime and evening
   education students. Although students received Web-Based Education and
   Web Aided Education were selected as experimental group, the students
   received ``Traditional Education{''} were selected as control group.
   After the application, significant differences between the total grade
   points of both experimental and control groups of daytime education and
   evening education students were detected. (C) 2018 Karabuk University.

Abstract = {{The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) (Shvachko et al., 2010) is a
   highly scalable and fault-tolerant distributed file system that can be
   deployed on low-cost hardware. The content stored in the HDFS is
   partitioned into blocks, and the blocks are replicated on multiple Data
   Nodes. Different block placement strategies can be used to make it
   highly fault-tolerant and to improve throughput and access time. The
   HDFS allows the user to (i) specify the block size to be used for
   partitioning a given file, (ii) issue only sequential read and append
   operations. It does not allow the user to perform random read and random
   write operations. This paper proposes an enhanced HDFS (REHDFS) that (i)
   explores different block placement and block read strategies, (ii)
   implements random read and random write operations. The proposed
   architecture is implemented and evaluated. The proposed load based block
   access strategy performed better than the other block retrieval
   strategies. The random read feature is implemented and evaluated.
   Pessimistic and optimistic models to implement the random write are

Abstract = {{Return Oriented Programming is one of the major challenges for software
   security nowadays. It can bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
   mechanism by chaining short instruction sequences from existing code
   together to induce arbitrary code execution. Existing defenses are
   usually trade-offs between practicality, security, and performance. In
   this paper, we propose PMUe, a low-cost hardware ROP detection approach
   that detects ROP attack based on three inherent properties of ROP. It is
   transparent to user applications and can be regarded as a small
   extension to existing Performance Monitoring Unit in commodity
   processors. Our evaluation demonstrates that PMUe can effectively detect
   ROP attack with negligible performance overhead.}},

Abstract = {{In this research a quadcopter, which is also known as including four
   rotors, had been assembled to equipped with video camera derived by a
   step motor and controlled by Arduino card programmed by LabVIEW to
   control both the video camera and the quadcopter movements through
   mobile application programmed for that.
   The available quad copter with video camera is extremally expensive
   especially if it was controlled by mobile, the idea is to imitate it by
   low cost equipment's leads to a mobile controlled quadcopter with
   controlled video camera less expensive by about ten time the commercial
   one available. Many challenges were solved including fixing the
   stability and controllability of both video camera and quadcopter and
   the excessive lode due to the video camera, Arduino card and the step
   motor weight, also fixed the shifting in aerodynamic and gravity center
   arrived by that load. A mathematical model was built by solid work and
   had been tested by Ansys to ensure that. The equipped quadcopter was
   worked properly and both images and films taken by it was acceptable
   with respect to those taken by commercial one.}},

Abstract = {{In developing countries like India, the school and college education
   systems are mired in the passive, teacher-centric pedagogy based on rote

Abstract = {{This research explores the real-time process control of polymer
   flowability in Powder Bed Fusion (PBF). To do so, a novel system based
   on machine vision and an image-processing algorithm was developed and
   tested in an open hardware and software PBF system. The system has the
   ability to analyze the quality of the powder bed by computing a defect
   ratio of the powder bed after each recoating operation. Then, this ratio
   is used as a performance variable in three full factorial Design of
   Experiments (DOE). The results show that the installation of machine
   vision and image processing system can potentially provide a signal to
   repeat the recoating process and correct the defect on the powder bed.
   At the same time, recoating process parameters can be adjusted
   dynamically to guarantee an optimum quality of the powder bed and
   minimize possible build failures.}},

   environmental monitoring station, the S3ME2, with a multitude of sensors
   capable of operating in extreme environments (from cold arid sub -arctic
   retOorts to hot deserts and high -altitude mountain terrains), providing
   realtime quality data of ctitical climate and geophysical parameters for
   a wide field of research such as pressure, surface and subsurface
   temperature and llimidity, magnetic field and seismic activity-. The
   dedicated communication modem utilizes loT technolo{*}, and can deliver
   this data from remote regions. The S3ME2 has been designed as a low-cost
   instrument to facilitate the production of multiple units. During the
   pilot phase, it has demonstrated continuous operability for up to 6
   months, including survival (luting extremely cold, snowy, and low
   insolation, and low wind periods in the Sub -Arctic region. With its
   robust desim, S3ME2 exploits the use of renewable sources of enert,,,y
   such as solar and wind power to power the system. The S3ME2 has also
   been desigited from a modular point of view with commercial off the

Abstract = {{It has been identified from literature that affordability is the main
   constraint faced by the majority of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network)
   researchers which sees them forgoing implementing real world
   experimental studies that are costlier, in favour of opting for cheaper
   simulation tools instead. While simulation tools provide a simple and
   inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols
   in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real
   systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils
   the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC)
   car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a
   fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical
   knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted
   to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being
   really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly
   customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by
   utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies
   that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all
   aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines
   contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots
   that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn
   ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds
   as their evaluation tool.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence algorithms have a wide range of application
   possibilities such as in the fields of engineering, economics, biology
   and medicine. One technique that emerges from the use of such algorithms
   is the electrical impedance tomography (EIT), which consists of a
   noninvasive and free of ionizing radiation imaging technique with
   applications in industry, geophysics and medicine. The technique is
   based on the application of a pattern of alternating low amplitude and
   high-frequency electric current through electrodes arranged around the
   surface of the section of the object to be imaged and in the consequent
   analysis of the electric potential measured by others electrodes. EIT
   technique consists of the solution to the direct and inverse problems.
   The direct problem consists in defining the electrical potentials within
   the object section and the potentials measured in its boundary by
   knowing the internal conductivity distribution of the object and the
   current excitation pattern, the relation of which is given by Laplace's
   equation. However, the estimation of the conductivity and electrical
   permittivity distribution of the interior of the body section from the
   measurements of the excitation response is mathematically an inverse,
   nonlinear and ill-posed problem. These characteristics make their
   solution quite dependent on the reconstruction and regularization
   algorithm and can be obtained through noniterative and interactive
   methods. The proposal of this chapter is to present the development of a
   low-cost hardware-software electrical impedance tomography system
   employing a project-partitioning strategy, developed for the acquisition
   and conditioning of data to preprocess and transfer the electrical
   potentials from the measured boundary of the object to a computer,
   performing the image reconstruction with swarm-based algorithms, namely,
   particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony and fish school
   search.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive
   Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring
   and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land
   use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this
   paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a
   low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic
   augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine
   learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common
   cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we
   find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers
   (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine
   learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and
   provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental
   protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the
   system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment
   of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications.}},

Abstract = {{As occupants and their behaviors are responsible for a significant share
   of the energy consumption in buildings, it is of important to gather
   occupancy data. In fact, gathering occupancy data is considered as one
   of the grand challenges in building information modeling. Capitalizing
   on the pervasiveness of mobile devices with Bluetooth (BT)
   functionality, in this paper, we propose an occupant detection system
   that uses the BT signal to infer occupant presence. We present the
   low-cost hardware based on the Raspberry Pi and the open-source
   software. We apply our approach in a real building environment with two
   experimental scenarios: 1) Occupancy estimation of a whole building
   level, and 2) Characterization of occupant types in a shared office. We
   estimate the ratio r of detected BT devices to actual number of people
   to be r approximate to 0.64. Our results show robust detection of
   occupants, as well as successful characterization of occupancy types as
   stationary, regular occupants, and visitors. Our method can be deployed
   quickly, and does not require the occupants to install a specific
   software. Thus, the proposed approach is especially useful for retrofit
   solutions.}},

   LASIMUP (LArge Scale Interactive MUltiProjection), a platform that aims
   to bypass that limitation by developing the appropriate software and the
   use of low-cost supplementary hardware which can enable such
   functionality. The platform presented has the benefits of being
   cross-platform, easy to install and affordable to acquire. These factors
   enable the possibility of creating large scale applications, that

Abstract = {{Over the past several years, there has been a rise in online learning
   platforms and websites for skill acquisition. However, traditional
   learning analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of presented material
   are limited in that they do not acquire information regarding the user's
   biophysical state during this learning process. In this paper, we
   propose an inexpensive system for evaluating online learners' engagement
   and performance via electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, and
   behavioral data methods. Such information is of interest to (i)
   neuroscientists and psychologists aiming to quantify computerized
   learning processes and developing models to represent learning states,
   as well as to (ii) individuals designing educational content to better
   understand how information is accessed and utilized by users. We first
   describe the selection, design, and integration of the bio-signal
   components. We then demonstrate the combined utility of our system
   through recording signals while participants (N=22) completed German
   language lessons on the free web-based platform, Duolingo. As low-cost
   hardware is utilized in our system, data acquisition can readily be
   scaled to multiple research sites or remote collection, allowing for
   access to more naturalistic datasets not typically studied using
   traditional laboratory research systems.}},

Abstract = {{The recent emergence of open hardware platforms has drastically reduced
   the cost required to develop special purpose device architectures. The
   RISC-V instruction set and associated ecosystem is one such architecture
   that has become widely popular as the basis for the next generation

   Despite the recent popularity of the RISC-V architecture, there is
   currently very little support for performing architectural experiments
   of high performance RISC-V devices designed to target high performance
   computing and high performance analytics applications. Further, there
   are no general purpose simulation infrastructures that support
   developing architectural experiments using RISC-V cores coupled to
   emerging memory devices such as HBM and HMC. As a result, there is
   currently a significant gap for those seeking to develop high
   performance architectural models using emerging memory devices and the
   RISC-V instruction set.
   The Stake infrastructure is designed to provide integrated simulation
   capabilities that supports experimentation using RISC-V processing cores
   as well as emerging memory devices. Stake is constructed using a fusion
   of the existing RISC-V Spike functional simulation infrastructure
   coupled to a custom memory generation component within the Sandia
   Structural Simulation (SST) framework. The result being an integrated
   simulation infrastructure that has the ability to simulate heterogeneous
   mixtures of hierarchical caches, traditional DRAM memories and emerging
   memory devices. We demonstrate this infrastructure with a design study
   to elicit the efficacy of 64 bit RISC-V cores on executing graph
   applications using different mixtures of cache, DRAM memories and HMC
   memories. In this study, we utilize the Graph Analytics Benchmark Suite
   to drive simulated memory traffic into mixtures of single level and
   multi-level caches coupled to each of the aforementioned backend memory
   devices. From this, we determine that in our simulated architecture, the
   HMC memory configuration with a single (L1) caching layer provides the
   most advantageous system configuration for executing graph algorithms
   and applications.}},

Abstract = {{Open Source Hardware (OSH) products are those whose design are made
   publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make,
   and sell them. In spite of the increasing popularity of this novel
   approach to intellectual property in product innovation, practice
   communities have faced difficulties to refine this concept into sharp
   and practical terms. There is to date no widely acknowledged criteria
   for determining whether a product is open source or not. Assuming OSH
   follows the same development path as Open Source Software and becomes a
   mainstream approach, the issue of conformance will also become critical
   for both producers and consumers. To address this gap, this contribution
   introduces a self-declared product openness marking scheme allowing to
   rate the openness of a product. Looking forward, it provides conceptual
   inputs for the future establishment of technical standards bringing
   clarity in this emerging and moving field. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result
   of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing
   with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing
   courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way
   computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning
   approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware
   prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet
   of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become
   in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning
   process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to
   investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware
   platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular,
   we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits
   for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and
   engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of
   our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more
   experiential using the hardware prototyping paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and
   learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial
   components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and
   variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic
   thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well
   as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language,
   using hands-on designs and activities that require the components
   mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the
   curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for
   students of technology in electronics (n=22), observing that the
   students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation
   and engagement towards the software area was increased during the
   course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming
   language Python in order to interact with the different ports,
   peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link
   between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design,
   e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).
   Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects,
   firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are
   involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas
   as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly,
   programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering
   but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{Although inertial navigation based orientation finding is completely
   autonomous, its real-time performance is limited by the accuracy of
   gyro, and the cost is very high, which is not suitable for low cost
   applications, An attitude determination system compose of rotation
   mechanism and multiple Beidou receivers is proposed, which have the
   advantages from both inertial system and GNSS system. It is a low cost
   attitude determination system for low dynamic applications. A rotary
   encoder is used to provide the rotation speed information and modulated
   relative rotation angle information, with this information the output
   from Beidou attitude determination algorithm can be filtered and
   screened. By discriminate the common mode system error and differential
   system error, environment dependent effects such as multipath can be
   minimized, the accuracy of static attitude determination can be improved
   with data of multiple epochs. A prototype of the system had been built
   and shown. The data were collected and analyzed. The results show that
   real-time north finding with high accuracy can be achieved based on the
   low cost hardware design, the dependence of the heading performance with
   environment for Beidou system is reduced, A heading performance of 0.04

Abstract = {{Big Data is relatively new, started about a decade ago benefiting from
   the data explosion in different sectors, driven by the low-cost;
   hardware, storage, software tools, beside the massive proliferation of
   computing technology in everything we do, which led to generating huge
   amounts of data of all types. In the chemicals sector, there is also
   huge volumes of data accumulated over the years but a small percentage
   of it is being used. Big Data is at its infancy stage in the chemicals
   sector, though started to rise up in the past few years. In this paper
   we discuss the specific needs, features and challenges at this sector
   and how Big Data can help addressing some of these challenges. We also
   discuss Big Data in the entire context of automation and digitalisation
   at the chemicals sector. Benefits that can be obtained from applying Big
   Data in this sector are also reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{The Exponential Golomb and Context Adaptive Variable Length Coding are
   the entropy eoding tools for H.264/AVC in baseline proffle. Since the
   Exp\_Golomb is based on variable length codes with a regular
   construction, strong error resilience is achieved. However, its hardware
   implementation causes a challenge due to the logarithmic operation. This
   paper presents a low-cost hardware architecture for Exp\_Golomb.
   Furthermore, a ``shift number counting method{''} is proposed to solve
   the key problem of logarithmic operation. This method can significantly
   simplify the hardware architecture and reduce the area cost. The
   proposed design has been synthesized with ISE Xilinx on Virtex IV and
   functionally verified by RTL simulations. The results show that the
   proposed design occupies 126 LUT slice and has a clock frequency about
   250 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded networked sensor systems are deeply coupled with the physical
   world, and the deployed systems are usually difficult to debug.
   Therefore, it is especially important to thoroughly test and profile the
   systems before deploying to the real world. Traditional debugging
   methods are incompetent for detailed tracing on resource constrained
   devices due to their intrusiveness. This paper proposes a low-cost
   Hardware Assisted Tracing testBED (HATBED) to enable non-intrusive
   tracing and profiling for embedded networked sensor systems independent
   of operating systems and applications. We hope HATBED will foster
   research on comprehensive testing and profiling of embedded networked
   systems based on modern 32-bit architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Computational methods for the enhancement of energy efficiency rely on a
   measurement process with sufficient accuracy and number of measurements.
   Networked energy meters, energy monitors, serve as vital link between
   energy consumption of households and key insights that reveal strategies
   to achieve significant energy savings. During the design of such an
   energy monitor, several aspects such as data update rate or variety of
   measured physical quantities have to be considered. This paper
   introduces YoMoPie, a user-oriented energy monitor based on the
   Raspberry Pi platform that aims to enable intelligent energy services in
   households. YoMoPie measures active as well as apparent power, stores
   data locally, and integrates an easy to use Python library. Furthermore,
   the presented energy monitor comes with a Python API enabling the
   execution of user-designed services to enhance energy efficiency in
   buildings and households. Along with the presented design, possible
   applications that could run on top of this system such as residential
   demand response, immediate user feedback, smart meter data analytics, or
   energy disaggregation are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented,
   which compares the measurement accuracy of YoMoPie to a certified energy
   analyser for a selection of common household appliances.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning methods play a vital role in Internet of things analytics.
   One of the main subgroups of machine learning algorithm is Deep
   Learning. Raw data is collected from devices. Collecting data from all
   situations and doing pre-processing is complex. Monitoring data through
   sensors continuously is also complex and expensive. Deep learning
   algorithms will solve these types of issues. A deep learning method
   signifies at various levels of representation from lower level features
   to very higher level features of data. The higher level features provide
   more abstract thoughts of information than the lower level which
   contains raw data. It is a developing methodology and has been commonly
   applied in art, image caption, machine translation, natural language
   processing, object detection, robotics, and visual tracking. The main
   purpose of using deep learning algorithms are such as faster processing,
   low-cost hardware, and modern growths in machine learning techniques.
   This review paper gives an understanding of deep learning methods and
   their recent advances in Internet of things.}},

Abstract = {{MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) researchers have shown increased interest
   in using mobile robot technology for their testbed platforms. Thus, the
   main motivation of this paper is to review various robot-based MANET
   testbeds that have been developed in previously reported research.
   Additionally, suggestions to heighten mobility mechanisms by using
   mobile robots to be more practical, easy and inexpensive are also
   included in this paper, as we unveils ToMRobot, a low-cost MANET robot
   created from an ordinary remote control car that is capable of
   performing a real system MANET testbed with the addition of only a few
   low-cost electronic components. Despite greatly reduced costs, the
   ToMRobot does not sacrifice any of the necessary MANET basic structures
   and will still be easily customisable and upgradeable through the use of
   open hardware technology like Cubieboard2 and Arduino, as its robot
   controller. This paper will also include guidelines to enable
   technically limited MANET researchers to design and develop the
   ToMRobot. It is hoped that this paper achieves its two pronged
   objectives namely (i) to facilitate other MANET researchers by providing
   them with a source of reference that eases their decision making for
   selecting the best and most suitable MANET mobile robots for real
   mobility in their MANET testbeds (ii) to provide MANET researchers with
   a prospect of building their own MANET robots that can be applied in
   their own MANET testbed in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The design of simple linear control laws via linear mathematical models
   is a standard part of every control systems laboratory in a standard
   undergraduate curriculum. A typical example is the design of PI control
   laws for the speed control problem of DC motors. Embedded control is
   taught nowadays using cheap take-home equipment based on low-cost
   microprocessors like Arduino and dc micro-motors. Although offering ease
   for the demonstration of simple PI control laws, these motors exhibit
   nonlinear characteristics, which can be dealt with the application of
   more advanced control laws. The paper's purpose is twofold: first, to
   explore the possibilities offered by low-cost equipment, as a test bed
   for the `` proof of concept{''} of more sophisticated switching control
   laws; and secondly to unfold the possibilities offered by this new
   environment for teaching, demonstration, project work, as well as
   research purposes, in the current laboratory practice.}},

Abstract = {{When performing an experimental modal test, the user has to define (i.e.
   draw) a geometry of the structure which includes the 3D locations and
   orientations of the vibration sensors (accelerometers, strain gages,
   etc.). This step is often tedious and time-consuming, especially for
   complex geometries containing a large number of sensors. Incorrect
   placement of sensors can lead to important errors {[}1].
   In this paper, we propose a camera based method to semi-automatically
   link the geometry of an object under test with an available geometry in
   a CAD file. The technique uses low-cost equipment (a compact camera).
   Our method will be demonstrated on three test objects: a car, a bicycle
   frame and a drone aircraft model. In the case of the drone, the curved
   shape of the wing makes it very difficult to measure the position and
   orientation of the sensors manually. We show that we are able to detect
   the sensors with an accuracy of about 5 mm in the studied cases.}},

Abstract = {{The existing power generation sources are unable to meet the hyper
   escalating electricity demand. Common solution is to install new
   generation plants to fulfill the electricity demand which it is not
   cost-effective. A cheap and effective solution is to monitor all the
   appliances running inside a building and to use them efficiently.
   Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is one of the economical techniques
   to identify the appliances on the basis of their unique load signatures.
   In this paper, a machine learning based technique is presented to
   identify the devices for monitoring purposes. A low-cost hardware setup,
   called Appliance Identification and Management System (AIMS) is
   developed to identify and control the appliances remotely. The appliance
   identification algorithm is developed in Python and deployed on
   Raspberry Pi, coupled with Arduino. The hardware setup furnishes
   consumers with the real-time status of all home appliances on their
   smartphone and web server. Controlling module is also integrated with
   the identification hardware to provide smart access to consumer for the
   remote control of home appliances.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D full-field optical system for high frequency vibration measurement
   is proposed. The system is composed of a single low frame -rate camera
   and two planar mirrors. This compact optical setup overcomes the typical
   drawback of capturing synchronous acquisitions in the case of a camera
   pair. Moreover, planar mirrors allow for the use of the classical
   pinhole model and, thus, conventional stereo-calibration techniques. The
   use of a low-frame-rate camera provides on the one hand a
   high-resolution sensor with a relatively low-cost hardware but imposes,
   on the other, the adoption of a down-sampling approach, which is
   applicable only when a single (known) sinusoidal load is applied to the
   structure. The effectiveness of the proposed setup has been verified by
   the 3D vibration measurement of two different targets up to a frequency
   of 1 kHz, corresponding to a displacement amplitude of 0.01 mm. ED 2018

Abstract = {{Robotic automation is considered as the fourth industrial revolution by
   multiple industrialists. Robots are faster, more accurate, less
   error-prone and cost-effective when compared to human beings. For big
   companies, it is estimated that by 2025, labor cost savings from the
   adoption of advanced industrial robots would surpass 20\%. However, for
   small and medium companies, industrial robots are still expensive and
   unaffordable. Fortunately, with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT),
   artificial intelligence, open source hardware and software, and the
   declining price of electronic components, a new generation of smaller,
   cheaper and friendlier robots are emerging, for small and medium
   businesses. In this paper, we propose the simulation of an Indoor
   Positioning System (IPS) robot, which performs a forklift operation in a
   warehouse. The system uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
   technology, and Java programming language for exchanging data from a
   server. An ESP8266 NodeMCU module, an Arduino microcontroller and
   various components such as MFRC522 to read RFID tags, Ultrasonic Sensors
   HC-SR04 for detecting obstacles are used. This resulted in a very low
   cost, reliable and multifunctional system. Simulations have demonstrated
   that the mobile robot can transmit packets over the network to a local
   server for mapping without losses. Moreover, it can receive packets from
   the server to obtain destination points and mapping obstacles while
   moving around the RFID tagged floor.}},

   redundancy system which finds broad applications in sonar, radar,

   closed-form solution for a multi-station redundancy localization system
   is proposed by using the estimation variance as the weighting
   coefficient to compute an average of each group's localization result.
   The proposed method, with simple algebraic solution, requires no matrix
   inversion and can be used for low-cost hardware devices. The method is
   derived in TOA solution. It can also be extended to other locating
   technologies. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the
   performance of the proposed method in root-mean-square error. The

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is the recent way to join low-cost hardware
   and cloud computing, in order to manage a network of physical devices
   and their data collection. During the last years the number of devices
   connected to IoT is dramatically increased, as well as, the number of
   webservices which allow to collect and manage the data. Most of these
   services are free for personal use, and low-cost for commercial
   purposes. In this work, the IoT technology was employed to monitor the
   health status of maritime signals, such as buoys, seamarks, beacons,
   etc. The developed system allows to react swiftly and efficiently if a
   problem occurs, in order to preserve both the safety of navigation and
   the signals integrity. Furthermore, the developed hardware equipment is
   low-cost as well as the webservices employed to notify possible
   problems. The system was, initially, developed to follow the position of
   a buoy using a GNSS device for this reason, even now, the system name is
   ``Buoy Monitoring System{''} (BMS). Specifically, the paper describes
   the system design, its realization and the results obtained in terms of
   reliability; the case study regards all light maritime signals that

Abstract = {{The complexity and heterogeneity of digital devices used in embedded
   systems is increasing everyday and delivering a bug-free design is still
   a very complex task. The interest for open-source hardware in real
   products is demanding for tools and advanced methodologies for
   verification to provide high reliability to open and free IPs. In this
   work, an open-source evolutionary optimizer has been used to create
   functional test programs that improve the verification test set for an
   open-source microprocessor, enhancing in this way, the verification
   level of the device. The verification programs are generated to optimize
   code coverage metrics and are tested against a high-level model to find
   device incorrectnesses during the generation time. A perturbation
   mechanism has been included in the verification framework to cover parts
   of the device under verification not reachable with only software
   stimuli such as interrupts or memory stalls. The proposed methodology
   uncovered 10 bugs still present in the RTL description of the analyzed
   device and demonstrated the effectiveness of open-source verification
   tools for the next generation of open-source RISC-V microprocessors.}},

   low cost embedded systems, and actuators. The new devices should be
   connected and require a reliable communication between each other. This
   paper describes the implementation of an environmental monitoring system
   based on a wireless sensors network and IoT open source gateway that
   allows scalability and integration with different IoT services in the

   at single frequency has been demonstrated to be remarkably advantageous
   to other conventional imaging techniques due to the

   function for such promising imaging paradigm, and then apply it to
   investigate quantitatively the performance for three-dimensional(3D)
   microwave imaging. Specifically, the achievable resolution is studied in
   terms of some influencing factors, such as the distance between probed

   metasurface. Finally, selected numerical results are provided to examine
   the performance of above imaging system.}},

Abstract = {{The Lightweight Encryption Algorithm (LEA) is a block cipher algorithm
   developed to provide confidentiality in high-speed environments, big

   loaded onto resource constraint devices such as passive RFID. In this
   paper, for the first time in LEA which is one of the block ciphers,
   Bit-Serial technique is used to realize small area and power. Using
   Samsung 65nm process, we could obtain 2240GE which is 49.8\% less in
   terms of area compared to the state-of-the-art area-optimized LEA-128.

Abstract = {{Easy-to-use and affordable means of production (e.g. 3D printer), access
   to these technologies (e.g. in makerspaces) and powerful tools for
   online product design led to the emergence of open source hardware
   (OSH). Like in open source software, projects and online platforms have
   been evolving around physical products from various technologies where
   people jointly develop and freely share designs. We also find businesses
   that sell products made from these designs and offer complimentary
   services. This decentralized and collaborative model of value creation
   offers new opportunities for social, economic and ecological
   sustainability, but also calls for a different understanding beyond
   traditional notions. Results from an exploratory study on OSH projects
   and companies revealed that licensing is a critical issue, communities
   and partners play a key role in the open source ecosystem and modes of
   value creation are either centered around design or production in
   combination with a mix of complimentary services.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the increasing interest on robotics prosthetic devices
   controlled by means of physiological signals, a continuously increasing
   number of solutions are proposed. Usually the proposed solutions are
   very expensive and created ad-hoc for the final user. For this reason, a
   large part of the possible users can not afford this kind of technology.
   Furthermore, the software adaptation to the user is time consuming and
   physically stressing for the subject The paper presents a low cost
   prosthesis framework, which covers the three fundamental aspects of a
   rehabilitation system, i.e. the prosthesis, the sensors used to record
   the physiological signals, and the software connecting the two previous
   points. To reduce the costs we chose a 3D printed prosthetic hand from
   an open source project. We recorded Electromyography (EMG) signals from
   the subjects' muscles by using a low cost armband, a all in-one solution
   easy to wear and remove. The EMG signals are preprocessed in order to be
   used online, and they are used to train a probabilistic model for
   classification purposes. Furthermore, the model is built on data from
   different subjects, in order to develop a subject-independent framework,
   which can be used by any subject, with no need of draining training
   phases. We test the goodness of our solution with a leave-one out
   approach by classifying three different hand grasps. Finally, the 3D
   printed hand reproduces the movement performed by the subject. Data were
   recorded from four different subjects, each of them repeating the
   selected movements five times, and we obtained an overall accuracy of
   76.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{Long-range (LoRa) radio technologies have recently gained momentum in
   the IoT landscape, allowing low-power communications over distances up

Abstract = {{Infrastructureless wireless sensing is beneficial for environmental
   monitoring in various application scenarios, such as in a disaster where
   it is vital for the operational planning of professional responders, or
   in documenting long-term changes in climate and biodiversity in natural
   heritage sites. In this paper, we present a low-cost yet flexible and
   powerful hardware/ software platform for sensing, computation, and
   infrastructureless wireless communication. Since energy usage is a key
   issue for autonomous operation, we investigate the power requirements of
   various computing platforms, sensors and radio link technologies.
   Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate several license-free radios
   (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa 433 MHz and 868 Mhz) in terms of their real-world
   communication ranges. To avoid wasting precious communication resources,
   we apply machine learning and imagebased concept detection on-device to
   remove irrelevant data before sending it. We also evaluate neural
   compute sticks to improve performance and optimize their power
   consumption in our scenario. The proposed hardware/ software platform
   consists of small, low-power sensor nodes based on microcontrollers,
   larger single board computer relay nodes that can also preprocess data,
   and Bluetooth Low Energy enabled smartphone add-ons to give mobile
   devices access to long range communication technology. Finally, a Linux
   distribution tailored to the specific needs in this application area is
   presented that makes deploying new relay nodes easy even for
   non-specialists.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional manufacturing systems consist of devices with limited
   functionality and are constructed in a vertical structure. This is not
   suitable for smart factory environment where Internet of Things (IoT) is
   actively utilized and connected to external environment. Cyber Physical
   System (CPS), a key element of the Smart Factory, means that cyber and
   physical systems are tightly connected and intelligent. To build a CPS,
   IoT needs to be handled effectively, and stability and connectivity must
   be ensured. Therefore, the system in the Smart Factory is preferably
   built according to the loT standard. hi this paper, we propose an
   industrial device monitoring and control system based on oneM2M, and
   discuss that this system can be applied in a smart factory environment.
   The proposed system is based on Mobius, developed by Korea Electronics
   Technology Institute (KETI) as an open source IoT platform, and its
   components are open source hardware which is high performance with low
   cost. The Smart Factory system can be constructed in various forms using
   Mobius. In this paper, a model for its structure and utilization is

Abstract = {{Optical stimulation of neural cells using optogenetic technique has
   become a hot research topic in neuroscience applications. One of the
   prominent challenges of applying the optogenetic technique is
   photostimulation tools that can provide stimulation patterns with high
   light intensity and desired temporal resolution. Hence, as the
   applications of this technique grow, there is a need for simple and
   low-cost hardware that can create stimulation patterns and control the
   light delivery onto target cells. In this paper, a photostimulation tool
   based on LED arrays for optical stimulation of
   Channelrhodopsin-expressing neurons is developed. The proposed
   photostimulator also benefit from a control panel that allows users to
   easily tune the stimulation parameters and stimulation patterns
   effectively. An in-vitro test platform has been used to validate the
   functionality of the designed optogenetic stimulation tool. The control
   panel of the designed stimulator allows researchers to manipulate
   stimulation patterns, adjust stimulation parameters and hence, adopt
   this test platform for various applications.}},

   Chaotic behaviors can be created by even simple nonlinear systems which

Abstract = {{Objective assessment of taste perception is a challenging problem. In
   general, psychophysical tests based on the administration of a
   prototypical bitter compound, 6-n-propyltiouracil (PROP), and on a
   subjective scoring, are exploited. Since the PROP tasting ability is
   correlated to food preference and also to several clinical and
   health-related conditions, the development of low-cost hardware/software
   tools for accurate testing (e.g., in pharmacies) is an important goal.
   Previous works revealed the possibility to perform an
   electrophysiological measurement on the tongue able to provide
   objectiveness and repeatability in this kind of study. The technique,
   called Electrotastegram (ETG), relies on a custom thin-film electrode
   and an off-the-shelf electrophysiological recording system. In this
   work, we present a prototypical low-cost pocket-sized wireless device
   for ETG, comparing the signal quality against a top-class
   electrophysiological recording system already used for the same
   measurements. A custom Matlab interface was developed to collect and
   process the signal. By acquiring the signals at the same time with both
   devices, it was possible to compare the quality in terms of noise,
   amplitude and waveform. The results reveal a substantial equivalence
   between the two devices, thus opening to the possibility of using the
   proposed system in real scenarios, possibly substituting the Matlab
   interface with a stand-alone software.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid advances of IC (Integrated Circuit) technology make the security
   be widely concerned. Traditional identity authentication protocols
   depend on binary secret key and encryption algorithm, and issues of
   complex computation and high cost exist in previous protocols. To
   realize a low-cost RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) identity
   authentication protocol, we propose a two-level arbiter PUF in RFID
   systems, which has advantages of less area, higher randomness and higher
   stability compared to that of traditional structure. In this work, a
   double PUF based bidirectional RFID identity authentication protocol is
   proposed on basis of the proposed PUF structure, aimed at providing
   authentication for IC, such as low-cost RFID system. The bidirectional
   authentication between the server and the tag is realized. In
   authentication, the dichotomy XOR operation and character padding are
   performed to the response of PUF, instead of making use the string
   matching method, which will not expose the response of PUF to the
   verifier. Experimental analysis shows that, the propose protocol can
   resist various malicious attacks and can be used in many low-cost
   hardware systems.}},

Abstract = {{A robotic platform is essential to validate any algorithm developed for
   mobile robotics research, as usually simulation results does not reflect
   all the real world circumstances and error sources. Nowadays there are
   several available commercial solutions that can be used to validate the
   developed algorithms, but they are usually expensive and closed to
   hardware modifications. Another option is to build the robotic platform,
   but while these solutions are normally open hardware and can be easily
   modified and maintained, many are assembled using low cost components
   and are intended only for robot education, and for this reason are not
   suitable for advanced algorithm implementation nor can employ advanced
   sensors. A possible solution is presented in this paper, in which an
   open hardware modular omnidirectional platform is developed, with robust
   hardware implementation using modular commercially available components,
   at a lower cost that some more expensive available solutions, but with
   similar performance and capabilities being suitable for mobile robot
   research and experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{A successful phytosanitary treatment demands that the product must be
   uniformly distributed over the foliar surface of the tree. Modern trends
   are about the doses reduction of the active product, through the
   technological upgrade of the terrestrial sprayer vehicles. The
   traditional ways to apply these products over the field are using
   mechanical continuous rate sprayers. This yield a continuous
   application, even in undesired empty spaces such as between plants or
   missing plants. The Victoria de Giron Fruit Company of Jaguey Grande,
   Cuba, were suited with a lot of air assisted mechanical sprayer of the
   TEYME manufacturer. This paper is focused on the design of a low cost
   hardware and software architecture, addressed on the automation of the
   variable application of pesticides, through tree detection in citrus
   plantations. The designed system is composed by two distributed
   subsystems: the one embedded in the tractor is responsible of the
   positioning and tree inventory update, the other, embedded in the
   air-assisted sprayer detects the tree presence using ultrasonic methods.
   The performed experiments, showed a suitable acquisition of the position
   of the system. It was confirmed that the designed prototype allows the
   detection of plants with an accuracy of 98\%. The proposed architecture
   makes it possible to reuse existing vehicles by improving spraying. This
   will make it possible to save pesticides by reducing costs and
   pollution. These results are extendable to other fruit fields that
   employ a spraying system. keywords-Phytosanitary products,}},

Abstract = {{The trend towards highly-automated driver assistance systems strongly
   depends on the performance of environmental perception systems.
   Increasingly, greater attention is paid to sensor data modeling, because
   more measurement information can he gained with a good understanding of
   the hardware.
   Radar sensors are cost-efficient and thus often used for kinematic
   object tracking. Current techniques for the utilization of
   high-resolution radar sensors for object extent estimation, usually
   model the spatial occurrence of radar detections using statistical
   approximations. Although providing fast calculation speeds, the
   obtainable accuracy is not sufficient, especially when low-cost hardware
   is used.
   In this work, we propose a radar model which is based on approximations
   of every functional abstraction layer of radar sensors, from the
   electromagnetic wave distribution to the digital signal processing. This
   approach allows an inherent and generic modeling of the spatial
   detection probability of the environment, regardless of its exact
   content and avoiding any complexity issues. Consequently, the
   interaction between measurements of multiple vehicles can he accurately
   modeled. Additionally, various details like the antenna diagram and
   underbody reflections are included. The final radar model is evaluated
   and compared to measurement data.}},

   showing the inherent estimator errors and the external error factors

   under the conditions specified in the IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 and
   the total vector error of the algorithms was considered as the
   performance index. The studied and implemented algorithms were chosen by

Abstract = {{] This paper proposes a new approach in structured light correspondence
   to alleviate the camera-projector synchronization problem. Until now,
   great care was required to make sure that each camera image was
   corresponding exactly the correct pattern in the sequence. This was
   difficult to achieve with low-cost hardware or large size installations.
   In our method, the projector sends a constant video loop of a selected
   number of unstructured light patterns at a high frame rate (30 to 60 fps
   for common hardware), which are captured by a camera without any form of
   synchronization. The only constraint to satisfy is that the camera and
   projector frame rates are known. The matching process not only recovers
   the correct pattern sequence, but is impervious to partial exposures of
   consecutive patterns as well as rolling shutter effects.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Edge computing has emerged as a new paradigm that can
   reduce communication delays over the Internet by moving computation
   power from far-end cloud servers to be closer to data sources. It is
   natural to shift the design of cloud-based IoT applications to
   Edge-based ones. Activity recognition in smart homes is one of the IoT
   applications that can benefit significantly from such a shift. In this
   work, we propose an Edge-based solution for addressing the activity
   recognition problem in smart homes from multiple perspectives,
   including: architecture, algorithm design and system implementation.
   First, the Edge computing architecture is introduced and several
   critical management tasks are also investigated. Second, a realization
   of the Edge computing system is presented by using open source software
   and low-cost hardware. The consistency and scalability of running jobs
   on Edge devices are also addressed in our approach. Last, we propose a
   convolutional neural network model to perform activity recognition tasks
   on Edge devices. Preliminary experiments are conducted to compare our
   model with existing machine learning methods, and the results
   demonstrate that the performance of our model is promising.}},

Abstract = {{Soft wearable robots comprised of deformable materials have recently
   attracted much attention in the field of applications for its lightness
   and elasticity. However, there exist some limitation to the control of
   wearable robots due to the complexity of the model and the conditions of
   the wearer. In this paper, we propose a learning-based position control
   method of soft wearable glove using a deep neural network (DNN). To
   analyze our proposed method, we fabricated a soft pneumatic glove and a
   control board for the glove based on open hardware platform data. With
   our developed system, we collected the pressure and position data of the
   soft glove using a Leap Motion sensor to train our soft glove position
   network (SGPN). Along with our proposed DNN model, we could enable
   open-loop control on the joint positions of the soft glove by supplying
   pressure to the actuator without prior knowledge of the wearer or the
   wearable robot such as hand size of the wearer or the stiffness of
   pneumatic actuator.}},

   owner offers platform sources and individual developers separately
   develop various functional modules based on the given platform sources.
   Then customers will choose each module which best meets their needs.
   Second, the evaluation model for the open source hardware platform will
   be suggested. For open source hardware development, developers'
   participation is one of the key factors in successful project
   management. Developers will consider both estimated development costs
   and market size to make a decision on participation. With all these
   concerns, we built a platform evaluation model for open source hardware
   projects in terms of how much it boosts the developers' participation.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological (or biosignal) data acquisition and analysis has evolved
   from being intrinsically bound to medical practice or lab settings, to
   become a pervasive data source with numerous applications. This has been
   mostly leveraged by the proliferation of wearables and open hardware
   platforms. While the first devices offer good cloud connectivity (albeit
   to proprietary servers) but only provide high-level features, the latter
   have opposite characteristics, creating a gap in what concerns
   collaborative access to datasets for reuse in academic research. In this
   paper we describe a module devised to help bridge this gap, by enabling
   real-time biosignal streaming directly from an open hardware
   physiological data acquisition platform to a cloud-based repository over
   Wi-Fi. Performance tests have been made to assess the data transmission
   reliability, and the adopted approach to the repository enables
   user-friendly collaborative access, visualisation and sharing of the
   recorded data.}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic (PV) emulators are necessary tools for teaching research
   and development when actual PV panels cannot be used. Emulation can be
   used when design parameters such as size and quantity of PV resources

   available today use expensive hardware and/or require software licenses.
   This paper presents a new PV emulator using the extremely low-cost
   real-time digital controller platform ``Workbench{''}. The proposed
   scheme uses low-cost hardware built around a single DSP and a DC bench
   power supply to emulate PV panels which can be used to test other
   equipment such as grid-tied inverters, and/or MPPT controllers. The
   proposed scheme is modular, in that multiple such emulators can be
   externally series/parallel connected. Each emulator can also be
   configured to emulate a combination of series/parallel connected PVs.}},

   volumetric generation and processing volumetric data using an efficient
   low-cost hardware setting. Acquisition of volumetric data is performed
   by connecting several Kinect v2 scanners to a single PC that are
   subsequently calibrated using planar pattern. This process is by no
   means trivial and requires well designed algorithms for fast processing
   and quick rendering of volumetric data. This can be achieved by fusing
   efficient filtering methods such as Weighted median filter (WM), Radius
   outlier removal (ROR) and Laplace-based smoothing algorithm. In this

Abstract = {{Localization of eddy current probe in Nondestructive Testing allows
   merging the information of defect detection with positions. Typically,
   this task requires the usage of additional and costly position
   measurement systems or software assisted handlers in controlled
   laboratory conditions. However, many of these tests require free hand
   movements of the eddy current probes. In addition, in many industrial
   applications low cost is a stringent requirement. This paper proposes a
   novel solution to comply with the proposed issues. In particular, the
   paper describes the usage of a magnetic 2D wireless localization method,
   able to track the probe position during the execution of Nondestructive
   Tests. To the best of our knowledge, such approach is novel and promises
   to accomplish the localization issue in Nondestructive Testing by means
   of low-cost hardware. Moreover, it is characterized by a light
   computational burden, since it reuses most of the equipment already
   needed for the test itself. Preliminary results, proving the suitability
   of a real time simultaneous testing and localization system, are
   reported in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise networks' firewalls are rarely set up in a shared-protection
   (N:1) configuration, preferring instead the more costly active-stand by
   (1+1) configuration. This is due to, in part, to the high cost
   associated with software-based per-flow load balancing at high traffic
   loads. In this work, we propose the use of SDN/OpenFlow switches as a
   low-cost hardware-based alternative for subnet-level load balancing, for
   use in a N:1 firewall array. Our design guarantees that the N:1 system
   exhibits the same performance of a 1+1 system but at a much lower cost.
   In particular, the design provides lossless firewall handover of subnets
   in response to traffic bursts. A prototype of the system has been
   implemented in Python over the base of the Floodlight OpenFlow
   Controller and tested in our SDN Test-Bed using the ISPDSL II traffic
   traces, evaluating the behavior during traffic peaks. Initial results
   show that the system successfully migrate subnet traffic without packet
   losses, call blockings, or TCAM exhaustion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental setup developed mainly in the thesis
   work of a team of undergraduate students, who designed, built and
   controlled successfully a laboratory quadcopter. This project focused on
   the hovering control of a custom-built quadcopter with limited movement
   along a single vertical post, hence allowing safe operation in a typical
   laboratory environment, while leaving enough degrees of freedom for
   useful experimentation with practical PID control laws, which are often
   disregarded in the educational curriculum of a typical undergraduate
   control laboratory. The total cost of developing this equipment has been
   kept particularly low due to the adoption of a modern popular low-cost
   hardware and software Arduino-based platform and compatible sensors.
   Interesting future extensions concerning the possibilities offered by
   this new equipment for teaching, demonstration, project work, as well as
   research purposes, in the current laboratory practice, are also

Abstract = {{Challenges associated with developing analytics solutions at the edge of
   large scale Industrial Internet of Things (HoT) networks close to where
   data is being generated in most cases involves developing analytics
   solutions from ground up. However, this approach increases IoT
   development costs and system complexities, delay time to market, and
   ultimately lowers competitive advantages associated with delivering
   next-generation IoT designs. To overcome these challenges, existing,
   widely available, hardware can be utilized to successfully participate
   in distributed edge computing for IfoT systems. In this paper, an
   osmotic computing approach is used to illustrate how distributed osmotic
   computing and existing low-cost hardware may be utilized to solve
   complex, compute-intensive Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAD deep
   learning problem from the edge, through the fog, to the network cloud
   layer of IfoT systems. At the edge layer, the C28x digital signal
   processor (DSP), an existing low-cost, embedded, real-time DSP that has
   very wide deployment and integration in several IoT industries is used
   as a case study for constructing real-time graph-based Coiflet wavelets
   that could be used for several analytic applications including deep
   learning preprocessing applications at the edge and fog layers of IfoT
   networks. Our implementation is the first known application of the
   fixed-point C28x DSP to construct Coiflet wavelets. Coiflet Wavelets are
   constructed in the form of an osmotic microservice, using embedded
   low-level machine language to program the C28x at the network edge. With
   the graph-based approach, it is shown that an entire Coiflet wavelet
   distribution could be generated from only one wavelet stored in the C28x
   based edge device, and this could lead to significant savings in memory
   at the edge of IoT networks. Pearson correlation coefficient is used to
   select an edge generated Coiflet wavelet and the selected wavelet is
   used at the fog layer for pre-processing and denoising IfoT data to
   improve data quality for fog layer based deep learning application.
   Parameters for implementing deep learning at the fog layer using LSTM
   networks have been determined in the cloud. For XAI, communication
   network noise is shown to have significant impact on results of
   predictive deep learning at IfoT network fog layer.}},

Abstract = {{Passive structures are augmented with actuators, sensors and control to
   implement the task of active noise or vibration reduction. Such systems
   are considered smart because they have advanced functionalities compared
   to conventional structures. A smart aircraft lining is able to reduce
   the low-frequency cabin noise induced by tonal or multi-tonal external
   noise sources. Such noise sources are for example fuel-efficient rotor
   engines like counter-rotating open rotors. Research on smart systems
   starts on a laboratory scale by using low-noise sensors and
   high-performance rapid control prototyping systems. The replacement of
   such costly and bulky laboratory hardware is one important precondition
   for the commercialization of smart structures. The increased internal
   noise, the reduced computational performance and other restrictions of
   low-cost hardware must be taken into account during the design of a
   smart system. Experimental results on the noise reduction of a smart
   lining with low-cost hardware show that a replacement of laboratory
   hardware will not lead to a loss of performance. The smart lining
   achieves tonal interior sound pressure level reductions of up to 25 dB
   with a mass increase of only 2 percent. Even a mass neutral
   implementation seems possible, if conventional loudspeaker-driven
   passenger announcements are realized with smart linings.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Robotics as a teaching tool to foster knowledge in Science,
   Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - STEM for high school students
   is growing. Within this context, the need for solutions that decreases
   the overall cost of hardware is mandatory. In this work, a 25 euros
   Android-based mobile robot that allows connecting a smartphone to
   different robot ``bodies{''} (each composed by different hardware:
   Arduino, LEGO, etc.) is proposed, targeting mainly high school students.
   The mobile platform was built using 3D printed parts and uses an Arduino
   board to control the servos used for the locomotion. To communicate with
   the Android application, a Bluetooth module is also used. The Android
   application takes advantage of the smartphone camera and has some
   pre-implemented image processing modules, allowing actions such as
   coloured line following, colour proximity detection and coloured object
   tracking. Another import feature present in the Android application is
   its coding capability, thanks to an embedded code interpreter. This
   feature was implemented using BeanShell, a lightweight script
   interpreter for Java. It allows writing scripts in Java programming
   language, which are then executed by the robot. This interpreter also
   provides a way for the user to write a set of instructions that defines
   the behaviour of the robot, primarily by checking the current status of
   the sensors and the smartphone camera, and manipulating the velocity of
   the motors.
   All of the necessary components (3D source CAD + STLs) of the mobile
   platform presented here are available online, enabling the recreation of
   a replica of the robot body. A detailed list of electronic components
   and its connections are also provided, as well as the Arduino source
   code along with the installation file needed for the Android
   application. All the necessary information can be accessed at:
   https://github.com/ee09115/squirlrob.
   The high school students are then challenged to solve classical robotics
   tasks like line following, obstacle avoidance, and using the virtual
   sensors to create new challenges.
   By providing this set of tools (Android app, source code, 3D CAD models,
   documentation), a promotion of knowledge is expected, thus developing
   enthusiast students in robotics multidisciplinary fields, such as
   mechanical designing, electronics designing, mathematics, coding, etc.
   (in short, all the relevant STEM areas).
   Finally, a general analysis of the usability, interoperability and
   feature extension capacity is made, always taking into consideration the
   educational purposes of this work.}},

Abstract = {{With the increase of expectation for higher quality of life, consumers
   have higher demands for quality food. Food authentication is the

   authentication is Near Infrared Spectroscopy which, for instance, can be
   used to differentiate between organic and non-organic apples. It is
   effective but time-consuming and expensive. This paper presents a novel
   approach where low-cost hardware devices are used to collect apple
   images by using smartphone combined with pattern approach. We using a
   smartphone to obtain the apple image, the color always changes over time
   during the processing of the acquisition, and record the image during
   the color change. We convert the image into a feature vector in RGB
   space so that can be analyzed in some pattern recognition algorithm. In
   this paper we use Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA),
   k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine(SVM) to analyze the
   data. Experiments were carried out on a reasonable collection of apple
   samples and cross validation was used, resulting in an accuracy of

Abstract = {{Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing
   science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today,
   educational robotics tools emerge with the aim of promoting innovation
   and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are
   becoming more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to
   integrate robots into all levels of our society. This demonstrator
   focuses on driving the same content through three low-cost robotic
   educational tools. The first is Scratch, where you can schedule
   interactive stories, games and animations. The second tool is Crumble,
   an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a
   block programming language that facilitates its use. Finally, Arduino is
   an open source, hardware- and software-based platform that is easy to
   use and has great potential for developing robotic applications. This
   demonstrator aims to present the above platforms as educational robotics
   tools as the first step into the world of robotics. Throughout this
   demonstrator an introduction to educational robotics is developed.}},

   Inverse Model Controller}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural
   network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of
   a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with
   exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel
   architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck
   converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with
   a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was
   designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink
   (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware
   Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and
   determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8 W PV cell,
   a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was
   used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P\&O traditional
   algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the
   operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of
   neural controller over the P\&O. Implementation results showed that
   approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the
   P\&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10 W, in contrast
   to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W.}},

Abstract = {{Modern ultrasonic phased-array controllers are electronic systems
   capable of delaying the transmitted or received signals of multiple
   transducers. Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of
   electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are
   available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However,
   emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or
   ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities
   provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present
   Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides
   hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at
   controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our
   system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable
   users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging
   applications. The software can be used to define array geometries,
   simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected
   driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and
   can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and pi/5
   phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase
   the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical
   geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic
   levitation, and haptic feedback.}},
