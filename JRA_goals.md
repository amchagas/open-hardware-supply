### Goals for the JRA position (june-aug 2023)

We built a large database of metadata for academic publications on the subject of open hardware, which was then imported to Zotero. The current challenge is to code these publications for the quality of their openness according to a set of criteria. The objective is to contribute to this process, automating steps to facilitate and accelerate the coding, but also taking part in the coding of publications, most importantly to get a sense of the work to be automated.

More concretely, the foreseen tasks are:
1. To download the full text of publications in the database, storing the files in a manner that integrates with Zotero.
3. To extract, from the full text of publications, expressions that are relevant for the coding, as well as any URLs.
   - We will work together and iteratively to determine what are the expressions
   - In addition, it would be great if it were possible to figure out in which sections of an article does an expression appear
5. To load that information in Zotero, as new metadata.
