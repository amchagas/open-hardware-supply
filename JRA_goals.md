Goals for the JRA position (june-aug 2023)

1 - Download PDFs related to the metadata from entries listed on zotero database ()
1.1 - find the best way to store the PDFs and connect them to Zotero 
2 - design and extract specific expressions (related to the research questions) in each PDF, 
2.1 - Challenging, but very useful would be to also provide the article section where each expression appeared (they can be present more than once per article in different sections)
3 - find and store URLs present in the PDFs 
4 - add information gathered in points 2 and 3 as "extra" metadata in each zotero
