# OSH_papers_DB
database for papers on open source hardware

`openhardware_webofscience.csv` contains raw references that turned up in a search using the following search terms: "open hardware" OR "open source hardware" OR "open science hardware" OR "free and open source hardware" OR "FOSH" or "open labware" - this dataset still needs to be cleaned up so that only papers describing an equipment AND containing proper documentation are present.
